                    <div class="plaintext-content">So many of you took the time to give their thoughts on 'advertising' our <br/>
great pastime. We've read all your good ideas and will take them to heart. I want <br/>
to thank you all.<br/>
<br/>
Old Blue and I will discuss at length what we're going to say before the <br/>
reporter gets here and we'll be sure there's an emphasis on leaving no trace. We <br/>
both agree that the best thing about letterboxing for us is that it takes us to <br/>
places we'd never go otherwise, not being particularly 'outdoorsy' folks. <br/>
We've experienced views and marvels in out-of-the-way places like National and <br/>
State parks that continuously blow our minds. We recently made the trek to a <br/>
place I'd been wanting to go since I was a little girl but never did. <br/>
Letterboxing took me there!! These are the things we will emphasize to the reporter on <br/>
Thursday. <br/>
<br/>
One really neat thing; A-Bear of Idaho was also interviewed for this same <br/>
article as she planted a box while passing through (California) recently. So cool <br/>
to all be in the same article! <br/>
<br/>
We'll report on the piece once it appears.<br/>

Letterboxers take nothing and leave nothing<br/>
but good impressions. Sir B<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know it's been discussed before, but just to be sure . . . A good <br/>
piece of advice is to not mention national parks in conjunction <br/>
with letterboxing since we aren't allowed to leave anything on <br/>
NPS property.  There are already a couple of maniacal (sp?) <br/>
NPS rangers out for a couple of well-known boxers--no need to <br/>
fuel that fire.  :)<br/>
