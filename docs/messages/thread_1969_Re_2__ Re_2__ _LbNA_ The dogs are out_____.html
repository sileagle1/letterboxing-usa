&gt;Amanda Briles<br/>
&gt;aka The Paisley Orca<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Really cool to hear from you so soon ..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is such a new and exciting deal for me and in all honesty I'm<br/>
&gt;absolutely SHOCKED this hasn't caught on as big for us out here as it<br/>
&gt;has for those on the East Coast of the USA.  I think Der Mad Stamper and<br/>
&gt;Thom Cheney have done a great job of stoking the embers out here for the<br/>
&gt;past three years.<br/>
<br/>
Der Mad Stamper and Thom are marvels ..there is no doubt..<br/>
<br/>
It has been a huge privilege to communicate with em both in the past and<br/>
they have always promoted their location as the "true" letterboxers<br/>
domain..and it sure looks a great place for Letterboxing on the<br/>
web-tourist-guide pages ..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was on the website checking out clues for those New England states and<br/>
&gt;little old Rhode Island seems to have 72 letterboxes.  I'm generally not<br/>
&gt;good at numbers, but looking at a map and seeing how big Rhode Island is<br/>
&gt;compared to Oregon (not to mention the Pacific NW as a whole) just makes<br/>
&gt;me realize what really wonderful opportunities lie ahead for us out here<br/>
&gt;and those who visit!<br/>
<br/>
It is a growing hobby..exciting times ..You and Travis and all are very<br/>
lucky to be pioneers in the all new wonderful world of LbNA ...such fun !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As for missed opportunity on the trail, that's no joke!  We're just<br/>
&gt;stumbling along out here, not really expecting to meet up with fellow<br/>
&gt;letterboxers, as a general rule, I think. So to think we'd meet up on<br/>
&gt;the trail the way people seem to in Dartmoor and parts East of here must<br/>
&gt;means we're progressing.  Maybe it's time for me to carve up a<br/>
&gt;"Traveller" and carry it with me always or something and consider<br/>
&gt;trading images with fellow letterboxers the way you all do in the UK.<br/>
&gt;What's the etiquette on that?  I'd better get reading. <br/>
<br/>
I think its a cool idea to have your own personal stamp ..and a<br/>
"traveller" which is your "exchange" stamp..reserved only for those you<br/>
meet out Letterboxing ! (that's Dartmoor style) <br/>
<br/>
Our only rule (if any at all) is that a true exchange takes place..ie one<br/>
for one ...!<br/>
<br/>
But, well, if its just starting and numbers of letterboxers are few ..well<br/>
I guess you can make better US systems without my interfering ! ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Graham...will you be coming to our letterboxing summit here in the<br/>
&gt;Portland area in April?  It will probably be a terrific event if Thom is<br/>
&gt;working on it.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh how I wish I could !<br/>
<br/>
It would be just great !  But well I have to work !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I really hope we get a good showing of letterboxers from all over for<br/>
&gt;this Earth Day thing.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope so too...I wish you a really great time...Good luck to all and<br/>
Double good luck to Mitch and Thom !<br/>
<br/>
The more the merrier is letterboxing style ! imho <g><br/>
<br/>
&gt;We'd get the privelege of meeting you all, and<br/>
&gt;you would (if you haven't already) be introduced to one of the most<br/>
&gt;beautiful urban and suburban areas of the USA -- I'm not bragging, now,<br/>
&gt;it's true.  If you don't believe me, then I dare you to come out here<br/>
&gt;and prove me wrong!<br/>
<br/>
That's real letterbox-fighting-talk <lol> I cant refuse that can I ! <g><br/>
<br/>
I really would like to make a trip..but April is a bit tough, I am just so<br/>
busy...!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
But I will make it one day .. As soon as time permits ...I gotta get my F<br/>
count up !! <g><br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing<br/>
