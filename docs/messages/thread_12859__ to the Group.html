do you put a log book in each box? Has any one just put a stamp in <br/>

<br/>
For example, Ants go Marching in Hampton CT is a series of ten boxes, with <br/>
the first (and perhaps last) being a full box with logbook, but the ones in <br/>
the middle are micros with just a small stamp.<br/>
<br/>
I've also seen series with logbooks in each box.<br/>

You're right though, no rules ;-)<br/>

other people (or write them yourselves -- from yourself, not from other <br/>
people...) about that particular box.  Perhaps the stamp was exceptional or <br/>
the clues clever or difficult...  Just some thoughts.  BeMa<br/>

&gt;Quick question to the group. Letterbox series that you have planted,<br/>
&gt;do you put a log book in each box? Has any one just put a stamp in<br/>
&gt;the first few with the log book in the last? How would you feel if<br/>
&gt;you found a series that was set up this way?<br/>
&gt;Okay a couple of questions and I know there are no rules, I value<br/>
