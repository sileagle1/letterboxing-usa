I realize that everyone has a different point of view on cooperating <br/>
with the press. My view is distrust, and will not give them the time <br/>
of day. That being said, surely someone will respond to this note <br/>
and even though we are here on the left coast I hope that responders <br/>
emphasize the secret nature and stealth necessary in letterboxing. <br/>
Hopefully the article will mention a basic need to research web <br/>
sites, and check out FAQS, and mention the Newboxers list. Without <br/>
good background info the "Placed" boxes around Shrewsbury will <br/>
certainly be in jeapordy.<br/>

Susan ,<br/>
Please do not take my note personally. I wrote the post strickly <br/>
from my own view, and the topic of more publicity is diverse within <br/>
the letterboxing community. While most of us learned about <br/>
letterboxing from an article, many letterboxers see more publicity <br/>
as not necessarily a good thing. While your goal is to write an <br/>
interesting story, it may or may not be the most prudent thing for <br/>
letterboxing. <br/>
 The problem with articles written about letterboxing is that they <br/>
certainly will create interest and new folks to our hobby, but at <br/>
the same time those new folks in their enthusiasm will not take the <br/>
time(in many cases) to consider "How to Letterbox". After the Time <br/>
magazine article appeared we had 11 of our letterboxes go missing <br/>
within a two week period. In one of our letterboxes that we checked <br/>
on there were notes left in the logs "Our 7 year old loves this <br/>
hobby, and we let him rehide the box!". We found the letterbox <br/>
uncovered, right next to the trail.<br/>
The "Placers" of Letterboxes tend to be more than a little <br/>
possessive, and when boxes go missing, the time invested goes down <br/>
the drain. Placers usually hand carve stamps, make logbooks, find <br/>
great locations, and try to enhance clues for the "Finders". <br/>
Sometimes several days go into the creation of a letterbox, even <br/>
though a finder may not need but a few minutes or so to find the <br/>
letterbox. <br/>
Hopefully any article that is written will contain sufficient <br/>
background information so that the reader will respect the concepts <br/>
for the hobby.<br/>
Again, since I'm located on the other side of the country, there <br/>
should be no ill effects to our letterboxes, but with the above <br/>
information you can expect both positive and negative reactions to <br/>
another letterboxing article.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I tend to agree with you here.  The first articles<br/>
that I read about letterboxes gave enough information<br/>
to peak my curiosity so that I could investigate<br/>
further.  The more recent pieces that I've read give<br/>
way too much detail ie towns and names of boxes.  I<br/>
love this hobby and have talked to people about it,<br/>
but I always stress the secrecy and respect for other<br/>
people's property and environment that are involved in<br/>
this hobby.  As an aside, we take my nine year old<br/>
with us, but if she is tasked with re-hiding, we<br/>
always double check to be sure that the job is well<br/>
done!<br/>
