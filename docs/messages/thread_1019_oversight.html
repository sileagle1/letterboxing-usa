Folks,<br/>
<br/>
When the site was moved byte for byte to pil.net, the webmasters<br/>
asked (well I actually asked) if there are any clues you don't<br/>
want on the new server, to let us know.  The oversight was we<br/>
should have asked -- if there is any of your material (clues <br/>
and other stuff) you do not want on the pil.net server, let us <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for this oversight, and the question stands :-)<br/>
We were under pressure to solve the problem of the moribund <br/>
site from several people, and in the haste to provide some<br/>
reasonable level of service, some mistakes were made.  All I<br/>
can say, for my part, is that I was trying to do the right <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, I personally did _not_ want to move the site to<br/>
pil.net and have to deal with it, but circumstance left little<br/>
choice.<br/>
