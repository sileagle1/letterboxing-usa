We've placed a purrrrrfectly obscure one near a straightforward box<br/>

only a small number of finders look for the second box.<br/>

This happens somewhat frequently and depending on who the placer is, <br/>
you have to watch for sly tactics (you CT people know who I am talking <br/>
about!) .<br/>
<br/>
It is so much fun to find clues to another box in one you just found!<br/>

planned a certain amount of time for a boxing trip or are prepared for a<br/>
short distance but not a long one...having to add on more distance or time<br/>
could be troublesome. Of course, if the clues are printouts you can take<br/>
with you and come back another time, that's fine.<br/>

So my vote is that they are fun in moderation. :-)<br/>

I have done one, but I placed a cryptic clue on LBNA, just in case they <br/>
*stamp without reading* the log book.  Am I defeating the purpose??<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Proceed with caution on cuckoo clues and other 'sequential' letterbox <br/>
series.  I have often come across boxes that were missing/damaged that <br/>
contained (or known to have contained) cuckoo clues or clues to <br/>
sequential letterboxes in a series.  If the letterboxes are hidden very <br/>
well then it may not be a problem but in the event entire series are <br/>
based upon the presence of clues within another box, any 'accidental' <br/>
discovery of a box within the series/host box by non-boxers may ensure <br/>
the entire series' demise.  <br/>
<br/>
Examples of sequential LB series where initial boxes <br/>
were 'discovered'/vandalized:  <br/>
<br/>
Sunday in the Park with George (Salem, OR)--box number one fell into <br/>
the wrong hands and the entire series was jeopardized<br/>
I think the Jerusalem Jones series (Lacey, WA) suffered a similar fate--<br/>
resulting in a vandalism spree<br/>
(there are others, I just can't recall off the top of my head without <br/>
reviewing my LB journals)<br/>
<br/>
Box known to contain cuckoo clue that went missing:<br/>
Picea sitchensis (NW OR)--in this case somebody planted a cuckoo clue <br/>
in this box that we planted (never knew who put the cuckoo clue in <br/>
there just got info from another LBer that there was a mega cuckoo clue <br/>
in it)--the clue was quite big and didn't make closing the LB container <br/>
all that easy and subsequently the box was discovered and removed--<br/>
cuckoo clue is missing forever (unless the individual hid multiple <br/>
copies of cuckoo clues in other area letterboxes).  Since I had no <br/>
earthly idea who planted the cuckoo clue or what the clue was, I <br/>
couldn't inform the planter directly that the host box went missing.    <br/>
Fortunately, this cuckoo clue went to a box quite far away from <br/>
the 'host' LB so it probably wasn't vandalized.  What may be a problem, <br/>
though, is if this cuckoo clue was the only copy of the cuckoo clue <br/>
that existed.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that might help is making the cuckoo clue more difficult <br/>
to 'discern' than just a straightforward clue--that way if the 'host' <br/>
box disappears then the cuckoo clue within isn't necessarily toast <br/>
either.  For example, encrypt the cuckoo clue with a simple cipher or <br/>
include multiple compass azimuths so the accidental finder must be <br/>
armed with a compass in order to find the cuckoo box or use some <br/>
bizarre botanical description so it might 'intimidate' folks who <br/>
accidentally stumble upon the clues that some 'work' might be involved <br/>
to find the future box--if they're in it simply to vandalize boxes they <br/>
might just leave it alone.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you find these ideas helpful,<br/>

Yup, cryptic clues, compass, math, knowledge of trees, and lots of <br/>
paces deters those who don't like a 'mystery'! <br/>
The clues to my *bonus* box are only in one box, and as soon as it is <br/>
reported *missing* I will post true clues to its location.  after all, <br/>
it is a 'bonus' only until it becomes a solo box.<br/>

made about 50 copies (its about 6 lines or so) and stocked up the box <br/>

of the clue into the log book. <br/>
<br/>
We've seen the clue hand written in the log several times and this <br/>
certainly works. Others include multiple copies of the paper in the <br/>
box with works well with poems, lyrics, and other literary feats. If <br/>
you choose to include copies we'd suggest gluing a copy to the back <br/>
cover of the logbook so that people can find the bonus clue should <br/>
all loose copies get taken. <br/>
