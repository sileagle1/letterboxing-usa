I sent you a link to some chemistry information regarding the <br/>
differences between pigments and dyes as related to inks.  I do not <br/>
purport to be on expert on inks, on chemistry, on art, on <br/>
letterboxing...  hell, I don't claim to be an expert on anything.  I <br/>
only have the information I was taught by a reputable art instructor, <br/>
an old ratty chemistry book and Harriet, the ask-it woman at <br/>
Clearsnap (the manufacturer of Colorbox).  Of course there is the <br/>
chance that any one or all of these sources may be incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the fact that this really is irrevelvant to letterboxing and <br/>
it was not my intent to incite an argument, simply to correct a <br/>
previous erroneous statement, please direct further responses to my <br/>
private e-mail, not to this list.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

&gt; fading even when air dried." <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is straight from the manufacturer, can't find where the CHALK<br/>
&gt; formula claims to be pigment only -- or even pigment partly!  Maybe <br/>
it<br/>
&gt; is, but the manufacturer does not claim it to be so.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ~ The Cat's Eye pads are very nice indeed, they are however not<br/>
&gt; restricted to the pigment formula since they are also offered in the<br/>
&gt; Colorbox CHALK formula.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ~ As far as the ColorBox pigment pads not being permanent without <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; use of a heat gun, test for yourself by moistening a finger then rub<br/>
&gt; it across an impression that has air dried.  Mine didn't smear, and<br/>
&gt; that is permanent enough for me when making stamp impressions.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ~ Really, any ink pad makes a mess when wet, that's why baggies were<br/>
&gt; invented, to contain the mess.  The worst trick to be played on a<br/>
&gt; fellow boxer tho, is putting an Ink-It-Up stamp pad in a box.  Those<br/>
&gt; things are the cheapest, cruddiest, crappiest inkpads made, filled<br/>
&gt; with low quality ink that beads up on the stamp leaving a pitiful<br/>
&gt; impression.  That's the best reason to always pack your own <br/>
supply.  <br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ~ Oh, just to correct the record . . . pigment is what gives color <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the ink.  Pigment can be natural or man made, but regardless of its<br/>
&gt; origin, for our purposes it is a finely ground substance suspended <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; a liquid.  The vehicle used to suspend the pigment is what <br/>
determines<br/>
&gt; its use and function.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      The common names printed on inkpads: "Pigment" and "Dye" serve <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; identify the different suspension formulas used and how the ink <br/>
works<br/>
&gt; when used.  I think this is what caused your confusion and is an <br/>
easy<br/>
&gt; mistake to make.  If you wish to further educate yourself on the<br/>
&gt; subject, a good place to start would be your local library's <br/>
reference<br/>
&gt; books on painting and printmaking.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ~ Oh, another record to correct . . . the ink used in both "Pigment"<br/>
&gt; and "Dye" inkpads are water based and do indeed mix.  Not <br/>
convinced? <br/>
&gt; Try it, press a stamp on a "Pigment" inkpad then on a "Dye" pad then<br/>
&gt; make an impression on paper.  See, they do mix.    <br/>

&gt; &gt; Still, the Cat's Eye pads are nice for boxes not only because of <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh, and just for the record... an ink is either dye or pigment -- <br/>
&gt; &gt; based on the ink.  You cannot change it from dye to pigment based <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; &gt; the binder you use (i.e. glycerine) -- it is still dye-based ink.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; uhm... no they're not. Colorbox makes more than one type of <br/>
stamp <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pad and not all of them are pigment based.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My current particular favorite stamp pads are the Colorbox <br/>
CHALK <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ones. They are DYE based, not pigment so they dry fast. The <br/>
colors <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are fantastic, every single one of the pads are juicy not dry <br/>
at <br/>
&gt; &gt; all <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; plus they come in both the standard size and those wonderful <br/>
small <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cats eye size that are so good for when your out hiking.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; actually, we use all kinds of stamp pads and markers cuz I'm <br/>
into <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rubber stamp art and scrapbooking so I already have lots of <br/>
them <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; around. Repeat after me: re-inkers are your friend! lol<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; if you don't have a re-inker and your stamp pad is dry you can <br/>
&gt; &gt; bring <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it back to life by using a 50-50 mix of water and glycerine <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; &gt; you <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; apply like you would a re-inker. glycerine is cheap at the <br/>
&gt; &gt; pharmacy! <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This will turn your dye pad into something halfway like a <br/>
pigment <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pad though so it may take a little longer to dry when you do <br/>
stamp <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it so dont close your logbook right away or you might get <br/>
smearing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As for the markers I use, I like the Marvy brand brush markers. <br/>
&gt; &gt; They <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stay wet longer than most others, they last forever and come in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; packs that you can use the 40% off coupon for at Michaels. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Using markers: stamp a trial image on the stamp so you know <br/>
what it <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; looks like then color directly on the stamp putting the colors <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; want in the areas you want, then hold the stamp near your mouth <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; HUFF on it to use your warm breath to moisten the dye based <br/>
marker <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; colors, like you'd do to clean your sunglasses, then stamp the <br/>
&gt; &gt; image <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in your logbook. Sometimes you can get more than one image <br/>
before <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; having to re-color the stamp with markers.<br/>

I merely tried to correct and clarify information; little did I think<br/>
this would cause such a breakout of emotion.  I certainly did not<br/>
intend to cast aspersions on your education, just to suggest education<br/>
is a nice thing to pursue.<br/>
<br/>
For the sake of harmony, I shall yield to the quality of your<br/>
education.  I am sure your inkpad report, art class and chemistry book<br/>
have provided an in-depth understanding far greater than my Ph.D. and<br/>
career could. <br/>
<br/>
. . . As for the rest of my post, I stand by my statement. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the forum to discuss things related to letterboxing and that<br/>
that includes inkpads. <br/>
