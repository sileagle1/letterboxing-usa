It's a tad messy, but well worth it. I even use it to clue the "What's this?" paper to the inside of the Letterbox.  It's very flexible and it glues the stamps to the wood we use perfectly.<br/>

I will take a look for it... about how long does it take to set and <br/>
what sort of wood are you mounting too if I might ask?  Are you <br/>
putting anything between the wood and the stamp??<br/>
<br/>
Going to try and get this stuff today so if you could let me know I <br/>
would really appreciate it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It sets pretty quickly into a "soft stage" in about an hour, but to be sure<br/>
of it's 'take', we typically wait 24 hours before using the stamp...<br/>
<br/>
We used to put a thin piece of foam between the stamp and the wood backing,<br/>
but soon realized that the foam really didn't have much to do in the<br/>
pressing of the image and only served to make the stamp look more like a<br/>
store-bought stamp...<br/>
<br/>
As for the wood backing, we do it a couple of different ways... for the<br/>
smaller stamps (i.e. 1x2, 2x2, 2x3, etc.) you can get pre-cut pieces at most<br/>
craft stores like Michael's which is where we get ours... they are sold in<br/>
packages of 5 pieces or so, depending on the size, and are relatively<br/>
inexpensive... for the bigger stamps, RayvenDad goes out into his woodshop<br/>
and cuts the size needed from scrap lumber and such on his scroll saw... As<br/>
a matter of fact, when the ones that we have bought are all gone, he'll be<br/>
making all of the wood backings himself from plywood... The 'PNWLb Fright<br/>
Fest '03' stamp is backed by a piece of lumber that is about a 1/2 inch<br/>
thick so not all backings have to be thin... I guess it's just a matter of<br/>
preference...<br/>

That being said, I have one comment to make.....<br/>

Funny one can do something that others get their butts handed to them in a basket over.  Thank you Silent Doug for the short concise answer to Pandora's question and not re-quoting something you'd already written at your website.<br/>

P.S.  Any and all scarcasm read in the previous words was intended, though not towards Silent Doug.  Sorry for the testiness, I guess the weather's pulling me down lately. (soft smiles)<br/>
