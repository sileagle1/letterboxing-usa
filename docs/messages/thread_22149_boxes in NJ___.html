Subject: [LbNA] Re: Letterboxes on National Park Property<br/>
<br/>
..................So this leaves us with the one good question:<br/>
Are letterboxes permitted on NPS property or not??  I've heard a<br/>
couple of weak arguments that some have been permitted, it's up to<br/>
the local superintendant, they don't hurt anything so leave them be,<br/>
etc &amp; etc.  Nothing concrete.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone find the law or policy regarding this?  Please cite your<br/>
sources.  I'd like to clarify this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
