I had no idea there were so many nagging old ladies here. <br/>
<br/>
As mentioned previously, I'll contact everyone who is interested .... <br/>
and anyone else who is interested in the future can continue to <br/>
contact me. Fact is, this is going to happen anyway so .... if anyone <br/>
is confused about anything, I'm the person to ask, so feel free to e-<br/>
mail me directly. <br/>
<br/>
Otherwise if any more old ladies keep nodding their heads back and <br/>
forth, they just might unscrew and I'm afraid a bunh of heads might <br/>
just fall off and roll away, right under the table and out the door <br/>
or someplace ..... and I wouldn't want to think I was responsible for <br/>
that. <br/>

Geez ........<br/>
