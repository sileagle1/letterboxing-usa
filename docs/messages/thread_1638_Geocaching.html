                    <html><body>Please don't think that his comments reflect on geocachers in general.  We do both geocaching and letterboxing, and like them both for different reasons.  Oddly enough, every time I try to decide which one I like better, I think of something better about the other.  The only thing I would say about the differences in Florida  is that there are gazillions of geocaches, and very few letterboxes.  So, from that perspective, we *get to* do more geocaching around here.<br/>
I think that that guy was just disagreeable for unknown (to us anyway) reasons.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Please don't judge geocaching on one article. We all know how recently LB has had a discussion on contact with the press, these same concerns LBers have are the same as Geocachers when dealing with the press. All geocaches are not the same. We all have concerns for the environment too. <br/>
For most people it is not about the trinkets or the size of the box but getting there and being outdoors perhaps with your family or pets. <br/>
We have some very inventive geocachers in our area. With many puzzle caches that have to be solved before even stepping outside and then more on the trail. As an example I suggest looking at GCHKVQ Lassie get help<br/>
http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=fad9654e-b343-4b9d-83ee-93b6f40909b6<br/>
I And don't forget to look at the logs, which give an insight to the fun to be had just like Letterboxing.<br/>
I like letterboxing and am very lucky to have many talented lbers and cachers in my area.<br/>

Lol, I hit my first geocache by accident.  While searching for patriotic girl's box up in winstead, I was rumaging through the snow and stumbled upon it under a rock.  At first I wasn't sure if it was the normal garbage I am infamous for finding or a bomb.  We were pleased to find it was neither especially since  couldn't find the letterbox. Not really sure I am ready to get into it yet though, I like the letterboxing clues and stamps.<br/>
