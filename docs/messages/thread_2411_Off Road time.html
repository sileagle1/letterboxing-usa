                    <div class="plaintext-content">I placed my first box on 11-20-00, but never had time to do any searching<br/>
until this weekend.  I actually spent 2 seasons with the USDA Forest Service<br/>
NE Forest Experiment Station doing almost the exact same thing.  Everyday we<br/>
either had to either seek out plots that had originally been measured in the<br/>
50's and 60's to remeasure them or we had to set out new plots.  I became<br/>
very good at describing and recognizing landmarks and terrain features.  A<br/>
seasonal job in resource survey is probably the best preparation you could<br/>
possibly have for letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to go into more detail on my adventure yesterday later.  I'm<br/>
composing a letter offline.  However, I'd like to point out something.  It<br/>
should be mentioned with the clues when finding a letterbox requires a great<br/>
deal of time off the road. i.e.. away from the car or civilization.  The<br/>
issue here is "TIME."  The amount of time is not necessarily a function of<br/>
degree of difficulty.  Difficult could mean, going up a steep cliff 10<br/>
minutes from the parking lot.  I picked up 2 boxes relatively easily<br/>
yesterday.  The round trip took no more than 1/2 hour each.  After being<br/>
lulled into a false sense of security I set out for another one in the late<br/>
afternoon.  The trail map at the nature center gave me little sense of<br/>
distance and the clues only said to look for landmarks with no idea of how<br/>
far they were.  As it comes out, I should have planned it as a day hike.<br/>
<br/>
When I figured I had reached the point of no return, I was actually not even<br/>
1/4 of the way.  After finding the box and stamping in I ended up<br/>
bushwhacking to a road on the other side of the park and walking several<br/>
miles unsuccessfully trying to hitch a ride in the dark.  A bear encounter<br/>
before I got out of the woods did help get my adrenaline pumping.  As my<br/>
legs began to cramp up from being soaked, I took a chance and walked up to a<br/>
house with a light on.  A younger guy with a ponytail came to the door.<br/>
After asking me if I wasn't a "crazy man" he offered to drive me back to the<br/>
car.  He was going into town to pick up a pizza anyway.  He dropped me at<br/>
the car at 9:15pm.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that you should take the amount of time it took you to get<br/>
in and out and multiply it by 1.5 to account for searching time.   The box I<br/>
went for yesterday should have been listed as 4.5+ hours ORT.  Granted, I<br/>
took some chances that I shouldn't have yesterday.  However, a less<br/>
experienced person might still be out there now.  They might have tried to<br/>
get back through the woods, which would have been impossible after dark.<br/>

&gt; I agree that ideally the clues should indicate the distance and/or <br/>
&gt; approximate hiking time.  Most do that as well as mentioning the <br/>
&gt; difficulty of the trail.<br/>
<br/>
And for clues that do not list these details, the onus is really<br/>
on the hunter, not the hider as to whether or not to proceed with<br/>
the information available in the clue.  <br/>
<br/>
If the clue does not list difficulty or time, or trail maps are <br/>
unavailable, or USGS quads and other tools are unavailable, and <br/>
inquiring locally and other research fails to turn up any more <br/>
information, and the hunter still chooses to proceed, then they <br/>
do so at their own risk, as always, as well as if they do no <br/>
research, of course.  They can always say, before setting foot on <br/>
the trail -- I have no idea what I am getting into, let me try one <br/>
of the other 1000 boxes out there that is more suitable to my style.<br/>
<br/>
Some peoples' idea of letterboxing is finding 20 or more in a weekend, <br/>
while other people's idea is taking 6 months to find a single box, so <br/>
the clues will also vary accordingly.<br/>

I can't post the clue to the list because you might go out and look for it <br/>
on your own and blame me if you hurt yourself. If you really want to know <br/>
where it is, please send me a copy of your doctor's report from your last <br/>
physical exam (must be within the last month) and your complete medical <br/>
history, proof that you have taken advanced medical courses (so you can <br/>
deal with any medical emergency that might arise), a copy of your drivers <br/>
license (so I can be sure that you can legally drive), an equipment list <br/>
for items you plan to take or wear (so I can be sure you have the right <br/>
items), an itinerary (so that I can be certain you plan to travel at the <br/>
least dangerous times), an example of your pre-manufactured stamp image <br/>
(can't have you trying to cut your own, of course, that'd be too <br/>
dangerous), and contact information for every living relative you have (so <br/>
I can get their permission to give you the clue). Then I can arrange to go <br/>
with you to supervise each of your steps along the way and stamp in for you <br/>
(you MIGHT be allergic to the ink after all)<br/>
<br/>
Or wait, maybe you can just take responsibility for your own actions, use <br/>
your own good judgment to decide which boxes to pursue,  and stop panicking <br/>
about liability issues.<br/>
