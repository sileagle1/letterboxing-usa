  Subject: [LbNA] Status of DC Boxes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I have to go to DC in a couple of weeks, unfortunately I will be <br/>
  there the day after the gathering.  I will have one or two late <br/>
  afternoons to go boxing.  I was wondering if anyone could help me <br/>
  with the status of the many boxes in Rock Creek Park.  Plus is it <br/>
  safe to go alone?  I will be staying in Georgetown and my meetings <br/>
  are in the proximity of the Naval Observatory so I thought that the <br/>
  Rock Creek boxes would be perfect.  Any helpful hints or ideas?<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
  Trish<br/>

If you're going to any of them on Sunday the 1st let us know if you'd <br/>
like company.  We haven't gone up to do any of the Rock Creek Park <br/>
boxes yet and would love to do an exchange!<br/>

There are less flights that day.  If I could get in mid-afternoon I <br/>
would.  My free time will probably be the afternoon of the 2nd.  I <br/>
just need to think of an excuse to end our meeting early and avoid <br/>
all social commitment until dusk :o).<br/>
