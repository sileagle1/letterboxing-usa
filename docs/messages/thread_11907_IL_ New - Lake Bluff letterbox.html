State: IL<br/>
County: Lake<br/>
Nearest Town: Lake Bluff<br/>
Suggestion:  Recommend hiking boots for rough trail.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Start at the intersection of Sheridan Road and North Avenue (one <br/>
block north of the Lake Bluff train station).<br/>
<br/>
2.  Go east 6 blocks to the end of North Ave.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Continue through the opening in the fence along the footpath that <br/>
leads to Lake Michigan.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Near the end of the trail, about 50 yards from the lake, you will <br/>
see a large woodpile on your left.  <br/>
<br/>
5.  Just beyond (east of) the woodpile is a stump with many roots <br/>
protruding from the side of the ravine.<br/>
<br/>
6.  Go to this stump and carefully remove a few loose pieces of bark <br/>
and wood to reveal the letterbox nestled among the roots.<br/>
<br/>
7.  Enjoy the box and the view and please replace the pieces of wood <br/>
and bark so that the letterbox cannot be seen from the path.  Thanks.<br/>
