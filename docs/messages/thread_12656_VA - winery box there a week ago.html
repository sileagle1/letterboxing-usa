I have not planted any other boxes in this series YET, I do have other vineyards that agreed to participate, and I have carved other stamps, and made the boxes.<br/>
<br/>
However, I have really been swamped lately and have not had the chance to get out to wine country to plant the other boxes. I am going out of state to AZ until the end of June. When I return I DO plan on getting the other boxes planted.<br/>
