On Saturday, in the rain (often heavy at times) we found all of the <br/>
rooms, but one of the weapons was missing.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone seen the rope lately?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>

PS  What's the prize going to be, anyway... we really tried!<br/>

This is a tough one admittedly that is in a very off-the-trail hiding<br/>
spot. If other boxers in the near future can't find it, then someone<br/>
from the planning team will investigate. Hopefully a box isn't missing<br/>
already!<br/>

That's still being finalized but it will be boxing related.<br/>
