Beginning with LETTERBOX LETTERBOX in Portland I discovered the <br/>
wonderful source of water in Deering Oaks.<br/>
<br/>
On to find:<br/>
OVER THE FALLS<br/>
BANGOR CITY FOREST series <br/>
FIELDS POND boxes<br/>
COW PATTY<br/>
checked on FORT FREDERICK everything's alright plenty of visits<br/>
SITES FOR SORE EYES (nice mystery box)<br/>
POTTS AT THE SEA (replaced 6.4.03)<br/>
and checked on FORT ALLEN PARK <br/>
<br/>
As of today, I have hit over 50 boxes! Very exciting. There were <br/>
several boxers at the city forest series on Saturday but they were <br/>
nowhere in site when we arrived on the scene.<br/>
<br/>
Still no place to live up north - if anyone has any leads in the <br/>
greater Bangor Maine area feel free to pass them along! Otherwise, <br/>
looking forward to seeing everyone on Saturday.<br/>
