postal box, Big Guy!<br/>
<br/>
Must be some good horse treats in Idaho or something because he sure <br/>
had a hard time getting out of there. LOL  But once Deb Rocks got <br/>
hold of him she sure sent him on his way in a big hurrry! (Kudos to <br/>
Deb!!)  Maybe it was too cold for him in her state. LOL!  <br/>
<br/>
I've uploaded the latest progress map and updated the calendar to <br/>
reflect the new rotation schedule. we're just going to let him run <br/>
through everyone ... even those on the waiting list! I'll release <br/>
him as a hitch hiker from whatever port we're in when he does come <br/>
back home. (Can't wait to see the logbook and hear his adventures!)<br/>
<br/>
If you're a participant in this Postal LB please go to our site <br/>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dead_horse_LB/ ) and make sure there <br/>
isn't a conflict with the anticipated dates for Dead Horse to be <br/>
with you. Just want to make sure I don't have him arriving the day <br/>
you're leaving for a 2-month cruise of the Greek Islands or <br/>
something equally exotic. (Can you tell who's had enough snow &amp; ice?)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

only 9 days until I'm in Portland, OR where it was 50 degrees <br/>
yesterday vs the 25 degrees here and ... <br/>
only 19 days until we're in Ft. Meyers, FL where it was an amazing <br/>
83 degrees yesterday!!<br/>

&gt; Got home today to find not one but two postal boxes waiting for me!<br/>
&gt; One was the Beating A Dead Horse postal box which I had been<br/>
&gt; expecting and the other was the Days of Her Life postal box (thanks<br/>
&gt; Scoutdogs!). Even better - they each had a hitchhiker inside!<br/>
&gt; Happy, happy, happy dance!!! We'll move them along ASAP. <br/>
