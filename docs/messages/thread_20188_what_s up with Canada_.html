                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was headed up to Ontario this weekend and searched ahead of time for some boxes I might be able to do along the way and was surprised by the small number placed in Ontario and in Canada in general.  The smallness of the number seemed particularly disproportionate when I discovered that (a) almost every exit off the major highways I travelled seemed to list a park in addition to a museum or zoo or other interesting "site" to visit and (b) most of the Canadians I spoke to seemed to really enjoy travelling throughout their country (and ours) and enjoying the beautiful places it has to offer.  (Like my massive generalizations there, eh?)<br/>
<br/>
So I'm wondering why the number of Canadian boxes is so small?  Is it a "getting the word out" issue?  Is there something about letterboxing that is unappealing to our northern neighbors?  Is there a lack of "twin trunked trees" and suspicious looking rocks?  It seems like a wonderful place to plant and find boxes.  What's up?<br/>

Disclaimer: This message was in no way intended to discredit the number of fine boxes already placed in Canada!  I noticed that some people have been quite busy planting in their areas  - yay!  It's more of a general question that I mean to ask.  In fact, those planters might be good people to answer my questions...<br/>

areas.  There are 2-3 boxes listed for Vancouver but I would need a <br/>
car.  Well, if I can't find any I will certainly be leaving some <br/>
behind -- traveling beginning of Nov.  Would love to meet and <br/>
exchange at Fairmont Hotel Vancouver, Royal Canadian Lodge(Banff), or <br/>
Japer Park Lodge. Email me off list (sowbiz @ yahoo . com)<br/>
