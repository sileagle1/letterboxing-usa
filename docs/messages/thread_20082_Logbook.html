Good questions.<br/>
1. I use multiple colors always. They really bring out the stamp<br/>
images for me. No, by using multiple colors I can change my stamp<br/>
around all the time. That way if everyone keeps seeing my sig stamp,<br/>
at least it is in different colors so that it doesn't get stale.<br/>
2. I try to use up as little space as possible in someone's box's<br/>
logbook so that everyone will have more space and the box will take<br/>
longer b/4 it needs a new logbook. In my logbook I keep each box or<br/>
exchange image on its own page.<br/>
3./4. In your logbook? Yeah, I just keep them in the order I find<br/>
boxes and meet people. I'm sure everyone does this a little<br/>
differently, but I just keep it in the order of the boxes I find or<br/>
people I meet.<br/>
5. Yep, people do use travelers. It is a personal preference.<br/>
This is, of course, by no means an "official" way to do things.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

<br/>
I think you will find there are many variations to this!<br/>
<br/>
I carry a few different colors with me as some stamps just beg for specific<br/>
colors.  I tend to do my sig stamp in he same general color, but I am not<br/>
overly concerned about it.  Some people like to color in the stamps with<br/>
pencils; some use a variety of stamp markers to add color.  The options are<br/>
endless!<br/>
<br/>
I do not use a traditional logbook--I carry cardstock squares and stamp on<br/>
those, then mount them in a scrapbook with journaling and pictures<br/>
<br/>
I keep my exchange stamps separate (along with travelers, that some people<br/>
do indeed carry)<br/>

I do my sig stamp in the same color ... pink! ;) But I do carry a couple other colors with me and some markers. <br/>

In my personal log book I fill the page with stamps ... as many as can fit. <br/>

<br/>
I stamp in in order that I find or receive them. LB's, PLB's, exchanges, travelers. You name it! They are in chronological order. <br/>
<br/>
d. do people really use travelers?<br/>
<br/>
They really do!   Right now I have two personal travelers that I carry. One uses two different color markers (which is why I am carrying markers around with me!) <br/>

the stamps I've found have looked fine in just 1 color; but I try to remember to<br/>
bring markers with me and if I find a stamp that just needs multiple colors, I<br/>
use those. So far I've always stamped my signature stamp in purple; my <br/>
particular signature stamp doesn't really need multiple colors.<br/>
<br/>
b. In my logbook, I stamp the stamp and put some writing with it. If there's <br/>
room left on the page for more, I put more stamps on the same page. In the<br/>
logbooks I find, most of them have been really small, so only 1 stamp per page.<br/>
But if I can fit my stamp on a page with someone elses, I do, so the logbook<br/>
doesn't fill up too fast.<br/>
<br/>
c. I haven't had any exchanges yet, but I think I'll keep them separate. The<br/>
main reason is that I'd like to go to a gathering someday, and I don't want to<br/>
fill my logbook with exchanges from the gathering, which I hear you get a lot<br/>
of.<br/>
<br/>
d. I've seen enough mention of them on the lists that I think they do; I'm not<br/>
sure I fully understand what they are though.<br/>

We always stamp our signature stamp in orange because it suits the stamp.  We carry several color ink pads with us in case there is not one included in the box.  In that case we decide which color would look best with the particular stamp.  I put the stamps one to a page  mixing finds, plants and exchanges in the order I receive them.  My logbook is about 3 1/2 by 5.<br/>

In my limited letterboxing career (just 4 so far), only one stamp <br/>
would fit on a page of all I've found. For my personal logbook, which <br/>
is a standard book-sized journal, it could hold several stamps to a <br/>
page, but I've been putting one stamp to a page and then writing <br/>
about my adventure. This in itself can be a couple of pages. I tend <br/>
to be wordy (just ask any of the people emailed after finding their <br/>
letterboxes!)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; c. do you put your exchange stamps right along with the regular <br/>
ones? <br/>
&gt; or do you keep them separate?<br/>
<br/>
Haven't done an exchange, but if they all were at the same time, I <br/>
would put a few to a page.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; d. do people really use travelers?<br/>
<br/>
Haven't seen one yet myself.<br/>

Anyway, I like to use several colors and in my own log  book, I like to leave <br/>
enough room to journal about my finds and some of the  funny things that <br/>
happened.  I also stamp the stamps that I have carved for  each box I place and write <br/>
about that situation as well.  Yep, you guessed  it, I love to journal.  I <br/>
journaled from the 4th grade until I was about  30+.  It's partly the journaling <br/>
that attracted me to this wonderful  hobby.  (that and my best friend and I <br/>
giggling our heads off while we make  or hunt clues)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;a. do most people take different colors with them when they stamp? do<br/>
&gt;you always do your signature stamp in the same color?<br/>
<br/>
I normally do mine in black mainly because I like the way it looks and I <br/>
only carry a black pad with me.  If the box contained a color I liked <br/>
better with my stamp, I'd use it.  I'm not very picky.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;b. do you usually put just one stamp on a page? or fill a page with<br/>
&gt;various stamps?<br/>
<br/>
I don't use a personal logbook.  I stamp them on index cards and write the <br/>
date, location, box name, etc. on there and they end up in random places in <br/>
my house.  I couldn't tell you where one of my cards are right now.  lol.<br/>
In logbooks in boxes, I normally put my stamp on a page alone unless it's a <br/>
large book.  I normally write long notes with my stamp so I take up a <br/>
regular size book's page.  I sometimes will stamp the back of a page if it <br/>
doesn't bleed through and there's no other pages.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;c. do you put your exchange stamps right along with the regular ones?<br/>

Not sure I know what you mean by the last two things.  Letterboxing isn't <br/>
too big here in SC so variety isn't there.  We mostly have plain 'ol boxes <br/>
here but if anyone would like to tell me 'bout the last two, it'd be gravy.<br/>
