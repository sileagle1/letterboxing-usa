                    <div class="plaintext-content">At long last, my Appalachian Trail adventures are winding down to a <br/>
close.  I'm now in Monson, Maine, the last trail town of the <br/>
Appalachian Trail, with just over a hundred miles of trail left to be <br/>
hiked.<br/>
<br/>
As I think I mentioned in my last post, my Pocketmail device took a <br/>
turn for the worse and was sent on artificial respiration to a <br/>
hospital in San Jose where doctors are frantically trying to get it <br/>
to work.  Therefore, I've been particularly difficult to reach as of <br/>
late, and it's not going to get any better until after I finish the <br/>
trail.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, I'm hoping to reach Baxter State Park on the 22nd, and <br/>
summit Katahdin--the end of the Appalachian Trail--on the 23rd.  So <br/>
anyone that wants to head out and meet me at the end of the <br/>
Appalachian Trail, the 23rd is the date to shoot for.  But even that <br/>
is subject to change depending on weather, trail, and foot <br/>
conditions.  Unfortunately, it's unlikely I'll be able to post any <br/>
updates on my itinerary from here on out.<br/>
<br/>
Your best bet is to get ahold of Amanda (from Seattle!) since she'll <br/>
have the latest information about my whereabouts.  (Kind of, sort <br/>
of.)  And can organize any gatherings in Maine.  (Kind of, sort of.)<br/>
<br/>
And now, I must go.  The next time you hear from me, I hope to <br/>
say, "Yes, I have hiked the entire Appalachian Trail."  =)<br/>
<br/>
Farewell!<br/>
