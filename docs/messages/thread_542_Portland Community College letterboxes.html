have an interesting anecdote to share.<br/>
<br/>
I hid the third box of the series under a pile of large rocks that were <br/>
sitting in a remote part of campus.  Remote as they were, I guess the grounds <br/>
crew new those rocks were there and had plans to move them to a more <br/>
accesable area.  Just a few days after I placed the boxes, the grounds crew <br/>
began moving the rocks and spotted my box.  I received an email from them <br/>
telling me they had found it and where to go to get it back.<br/>
<br/>
As it turns out, the head groundskeeper is from the UK.  Just a few weeks <br/>
earlier, he had been talking to some of the other workers about the fun he'd <br/>
had hunting for and placing letterboxes in a place called Dartmoor.  You can <br/>
imagine how surprised they all were to find just such a box on campus a few <br/>
weeks later!!<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, the head groundskeeper is absolutely THRILLED that there are <br/>
now letterboxes on the campus where he works.  He asked me to let them know <br/>
the general areas where each box is hidden, so in the future they can contact <br/>
me BEFORE they start digging, moving rocks, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess now my 3 PCC letterboxes are legitimate fixtures on campus.  <br/>
What's more, I've made a new friend who has known about letterboxing longer <br/>
than I have!!  Sometimes, life is curious, isn't it?<br/>
<br/>

PS - the unearthed box has since found a new home and the clues have been <br/>
adjusted to reflect the change.<br/>
