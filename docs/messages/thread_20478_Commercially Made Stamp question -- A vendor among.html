THANK YOU for making this known.  At $3 a stamp, it is obvious you're not doing this to get rich.  I've spent a lot of time looking online for custom stamp makers; maybe I'm typing in the wrong keywords, but I have not found any that do images (just words)...and i don't have the time or patience to look at dozens of websites to find exactly what I'm looking for.  Those who do, or are more savvy than I am at searching, are free to choose whomever they want.  But I thank you for coming forward -- I've bookmarked your site and will probably be contacting you in the future!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">One of the advantages about living in nyc is that if I want to I can find anything. There are a couple of places here that say they can re-create any image for a stamp. I haven't check them out yet. The first two boxes I planted in Texas had commercial stamps because I wanted to get them :::planted::: and I felt like I was bogged down in trying to find out about carving, learning how, etc. Except for my personal stamp, the few others I have done have been by hand. They aren't works of art, but pretty cool. <br/>
<br/>
I feel that if you can find a truly unique and cool commercial stamp, or have one made, go for it. Hand-carved or not, it's the fun of letterboxing that counts. There are a couple of places here that sell awesome and totally unique stamps that are "hand made" commercially stamp artists, none of who carve directly onto the rubber, according to what I have read in my searching.<br/>
