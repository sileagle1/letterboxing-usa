Well, first let me say this:  I am a nerd.<br/>
<br/>
Now that you know that, it will make sense to you when I say that I was<br/>
bored the other day, so I decided to write a letterboxing database website.<br/>
<br/>
I would love it if people want to try it out and let me know what they think<br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the low-down:<br/>
- Anyone can search and view letterboxes.  Right now, letterboxes are listed<br/>
by state.  However, as more boxes are entered, search methods will grow.<br/>
<br/>
- To add a letterbox, you must create a login.  Use your email address and a<br/>
password.  All this does is identify you so that no one else can mess with<br/>
your boxes.  You'll have to confirm your email address, but it's easy to do!<br/>
<br/>
- Once you've added a box to the database, you'll be able to see it, and be<br/>
able to make changes to it.  If you go to visit your box and it doesn't<br/>
exist, you can modify your clues to say that it's gone.<br/>
<br/>
That's it, really.  You can post, edit, and view your letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
If you get an error, I'd love to hear about it, too!  Copy the URL from the<br/>
address bar and any error text and send it to me, PLEASE!  If I get bored<br/>
again, I'm going to add some automatic error reporting, maybe.<br/>
<br/>

Couple of things...  Name vs. Nickname -- perhaps a place for both?  <br/>

I'd like to contact you off-list, and I can probably guess your e-mail<br/>
address, but it'd be easier if you had it on your web page ! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Here's a little feedback based on some things I thought about while building<br/>
my version of the database:<br/>
<br/>
1) You'll probably want to be able to search by state, and by state and<br/>
county.  That means you'll need a database of county names so that there is<br/>
input consistency.  When we make contact I can ship you that database.<br/>
<br/>
2) You'll probably want a State named "Mystery" and a county within each<br/>
state named "Mystery" for the, guess what, mystery boxes!  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
3) You might want to make the viewing of the status info a user-selectable<br/>
option.  Some people don't want to know the status of a box.<br/>
<br/>
Hope these are helpful suggestions.  Again, nice job on the page!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>

Just curious (and it's early in the morning, so perhaps this would be <br/>

still mystifies how people can work with these things.  I have two <br/>
small questions, and if there redundant I'm sorry.  Are you going to <br/>

It's an execlent site, thanks again.<br/>

I will send you a excel file with the states and counties. Let me <br/>
know if you want more details. For the database could we enter <br/>
the 'Date Placed' - that way I can load historical letterboxes with <br/>
the correct date placed.<br/>

&gt; 1) You'll probably want to be able to search by state, and by state <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; county.  That means you'll need a database of county names so that <br/>
there is<br/>
&gt; input consistency.  When we make contact I can ship you that <br/>
database.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) You'll probably want a State named "Mystery" and a county within <br/>
each<br/>
&gt; state named "Mystery" for the, guess what, mystery boxes!  ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3) You might want to make the viewing of the status info a user-<br/>
selectable<br/>
&gt; option.  Some people don't want to know the status of a box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope these are helpful suggestions.  Again, nice job on the page!<br/>

&gt; Any are valid.<br/>

&gt; I was trying to figure the best way to get<br/>
&gt; state and county data.  I was<br/>
&gt; going to head to census.gov and look for a list<br/>
&gt; there, but I hadn't yet.<br/>
&gt; Any help would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mystery boxes: Good point. I have support for<br/>
&gt; mystery boxes on my list, but<br/>
&gt; haven't implemented yet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Status:  I have been playing around with the<br/>
&gt; user configuration stuff.  Is<br/>
&gt; there anything else that you can think of that<br/>
&gt; would be cool if you could<br/>
&gt; configure it?  Show status info was the only<br/>
&gt; one I had.  Actually, there's<br/>
&gt; no way to update the verified date yet, so I<br/>
&gt; might not show it right yet.<br/>
&gt; Any ideas?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I can ask, what's your real name?  And do<br/>
&gt; you actually hang glide?<br/>

&gt; I'd like to contact you off-list, and I can<br/>
&gt; probably guess your e-mail<br/>
&gt; address, but it'd be easier if you had it on<br/>
&gt; your web page ! :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here's a little feedback based on some things I<br/>
&gt; thought about while building<br/>
&gt; my version of the database:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) You'll probably want to be able to search by<br/>
&gt; state, and by state and<br/>
&gt; county.  That means you'll need a database of<br/>
&gt; county names so that there is<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) You'll probably want a State named "Mystery"<br/>
&gt; and a county within each<br/>
&gt; state named "Mystery" for the, guess what,<br/>
&gt; mystery boxes!  ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3) You might want to make the viewing of the<br/>
&gt; status info a user-selectable<br/>
&gt; option.  Some people don't want to know the<br/>
&gt; status of a box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope these are helpful suggestions.  Again,<br/>
