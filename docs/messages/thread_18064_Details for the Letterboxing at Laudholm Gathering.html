Sunday, March 21 from 11 am to 4 pm<br/>
<br/>
Location:<br/>
     This event will be held rain or shine at the scenic and historic<br/>
Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve at Laudholm Farm in Wells,<br/>
Maine. Go to www.wellsreserve.org for more information. Sorry, but<br/>
pets and smoking are not allowed on site.<br/>
     To get there, take Exit 2 to Wells off the Maine Turnpike (I95).<br/>
Turn left off of the exit onto Route 109. At the stoplight turn left<br/>
onto Route 1 north. Go through one blinking yellow light. At the<br/>
second blinking light, turn right onto Laudholm Farm Road. Bear left<br/>
at the fork and turn right into the Reserve entrance. <br/>
     From the parking lot head straight towards the big barn. Enter<br/>
the Mather Auditorium through the green doors just left of the<br/>
entrance to the restrooms.<br/>
<br/>
The Schedule:<br/>
     Throughout the day there will be the opportunity to hunt for<br/>
boxes, make exchanges while meeting fellow letterboxers, and swap<br/>
tales of letterboxing adventures. <br/>
     There's also the chance to get a great bookmark with the event<br/>
stamp on it, but you have to be able to tell one of your hosts what an<br/>
estuary is, so start researching now!<br/>
<br/>
11:00 DARTMOOR SLIDE SHOW<br/>
    Join us for a slide show by Deb Blanchard from Raymond, Maine. Deb<br/>
is an educator and author of the Lakes Region Letterboxing Trail. She<br/>
will be sharing a slide show of photos from her letterboxing<br/>
adventures in England! This is a great opportunity for those who are<br/>
planning to join Mark &amp; Sue Pepe's Dartmoor trip! <br/>
11:30 Demonstration and Information Tables (others are welcome- let us<br/>
know if you're interested)<br/>
    Mounting A Stamp - Isosceles<br/>
    Making Felt Pouches for Stamps - Phyto<br/>
    Creating a Quick and Easy Matchbook-style Logbook - Nautilus<br/>
    Straight Talk About Ticks - Culex<br/>
12:00 GROUP PHOTO<br/>
12:15 POTLUCK LUNCHEON AND EVENT-ONLY CLUES MADE AVAILABLE<br/>
    Please bring a mug for coffee and tea and utensils to help us<br/>
avoid using disposable products. We have a full kitchen so heating<br/>
items up or keeping them cool will not be a problem.<br/>
4:00 EVENT ENDS (help with cleanup is always welcome!)<br/>
6:00 WELLS RESERVE CLOSES<br/>
    Usually winter hours means we close at 5 pm, but I've made<br/>
arrangements with the caretaker to keep the gates open a bit longer<br/>
for this special event - just don't be late or you may find yourself<br/>
locked in!<br/>
<br/>
Your Event Hosts: <br/>
     Nautilus and Phyto (with help and support from Culex and<br/>
Isosceles of course!)<br/>
<br/>
Hitchhiker Policy:<br/>
     Similar to how hitchhikers were handled at the POE Gathering,<br/>
there will be a temporary hostel there for the day. In order to take a<br/>
hitchhiker, you must leave one in its place. <br/>
<br/>
Saturday Night Dinner:<br/>
     If you are interested in a pre-gathering dinner at Federal Jack's<br/>
Brew Pub in Kennebunkport, please get in touch with Amymisha or Mark<br/>
Pepe. This place will be packed on Saturday night, so it is important<br/>
they have an accurate head count so we can reserve space.<br/>
<br/>
Nearby Letterboxes:<br/>
     There are plenty of letterboxes in the southern Maine area for<br/>
those of you who wish to do some hunting before or after the event. If<br/>
you visit http://home.gwi.net/~moxie1/Clues/laudholm.html there are<br/>
few suggested boxes that are straight forward and fairly quick. <br/>
     For those of you looking for a bit more of a challenge, you might<br/>
want to check out some of those Maine Mystery Boxes. You can also<br/>
check the western Maine section of the LBNA site. York, Springvale,<br/>
Alfred, South Berwick, Saco, Kittery, Biddeford, Ogunquit, Portland,<br/>
and South Portland are all close by and have letterboxes (though we<br/>
could always use more - hint! hint!)<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there!<br/>
