Hey Wes !!!<br/>
<br/>
Can you change the "owned by" or "placed by" coding in the Point <br/>
Judith letterbox (Narragansett, Washington County, RI) to my login so <br/>
that I can adopt this box?  I see that it has already been posted to <br/>
the site, and since I didn't enter it, I can't edit it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

Anyhow, back to your original question, MadMary seems to have dropped <br/>
off the planet.  I live down the street from the Pt. Judith letterbox <br/>
during the summer.  I'm willing to a) adopt the box, b) post it to <br/>
the new site, and c) put the box back together with new materials.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting us know about this.  It is very important to <br/>
report trashed or missing letterboxes because many of us are willing <br/>
to adopt letterboxes.  You did a good thing by posting this.<br/>
