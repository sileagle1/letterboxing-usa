                    <div class="plaintext-content">I always hike with Molly who happens to be a dog. Many<br/>
times its just her and myself. I dont think the<br/>
issue is if you box alone or with others.<br/>
The lesson to be learned here is that you can box or<br/>
hike alone but you should be aware of the possible<br/>
consequences. Im talking about 1 day, letterboxing<br/>
type hikes. There are precautions you can take to make<br/>
it safer. The main thing you can do is to try to let<br/>
someone know at least the general area you are going<br/>
to and when are you planning to return.  I think the<br/>
next most important thing is what equipment you take<br/>
with you. By equipment I dont mean anything big.  I<br/>
would like to carry a knife, compass, mag light, pen,<br/>
a few paper towels, and a lighter on an unfamiliar,<br/>
moderate hike. If you can get a map that would be<br/>
perfect. You can add to that depending on the hike or<br/>
what you are comfortable with.  A GPS, phone, water,<br/>
its all up to the individual. I guess what Im trying<br/>
to say is be prepared.  The most important and<br/>
hardest thing to do if something does happen is to not<br/>
panic.  You have to be able to make good decisions and<br/>
think properly to get yourself out of trouble. It may<br/>
be hard to calm down and not panic but its what you<br/>
have to do. If youre hiking alone, you might want to<br/>
take a weapon for protection on the trails, thats<br/>
also up to the individual. If youre not comfortable<br/>
with that, dont take one. It could do you more harm<br/>
than good if youre afraid of your own source of<br/>
protection. Whatever you choose to do or carry, just<br/>
remember that someday when you least expect it<br/>
something can happen and the choices you made planning<br/>
the hike are going to make the difference on what the<br/>
outcome will be. <br/>

You know, I can't help but chuckle at the knife. =) I always see it<br/>
listed as one of the "ten essentials", but in times of emergencies,<br/>
how useful can a knife really be? Something so you can kill a rabbit<br/>
for food? Fend off bears? Cut down trees for shelter? Cut off your arm<br/>
if it gets stuck under a boulder?<br/>
<br/>
There's never any indication about what the knife should be use for in<br/>
times of emergency, and I've always wondered about that. =) In case of<br/>
emergency, I can think of a lot of things I'd rather have instead of a<br/>
knife, so why does it always make the top ten?<br/>
<br/>
Even, let's assume for the sake of argument, you are lost in the woods<br/>
for several days and need to eat--wouldn't it be easier to find<br/>
berries or grass to eat than trying to take down a deer for meat? And<br/>
even if you were inclined to hunt your own food, how many "average<br/>
joes" that carry around a knife would even know how to go about doing<br/>
so? Same goes for fending off bears or cutting down trees for shelter.<br/>
I'd rather spend my effort finding a natural shelter under a tree and<br/>
keep my distance from bears. Cutting off my arm might be useful, I<br/>
suppose, in certain circumstances, though I do try to make sure I<br/>
never put myself in a situtation where that would be likely. And even<br/>
if it came down to that, I'm not even sure I'd have the guts to do it.<br/>
Maybe I could scratch my name in a rock saying, "I was here!"<br/>
<br/>
All-in-all, I never really understood the usefulness of a knife as one<br/>
of the ten essentials. *shrug* That's just me, though. =)<br/>

<br/>
When the bad guy ties your hands behind your back, and only *you* know that<br/>
there's a knife in your backpack, which the bad guy left lying remarkably<br/>
close to you, and then the bad guy goes off for a bit to answer the call of<br/>
nature, or maybe the bad guy gets into a fight around the campfire with his<br/>
partner and neither are paying any attention to you and voila!  You get<br/>
free!<br/>
<br/>
But forget the deer.  Forget the bear.  Forget the rabbit.  They can run<br/>
faster than me.  I'd be looking for the nearest cattle ranch or dairy farm<br/>
for some beef.  But then, if I made it that far, I guess they'd probably<br/>
have people there to help me out and I wouldn't end up getting hanged fer<br/>
rustlin'.  Unless I was *really* stupid.<br/>
<br/>
Knives can also be used for cleaning your nails when you get bored.  My<br/>
father used to do that.  He also used to use it to fix the wicks on<br/>
dynamite, but I don't think I'll be carrying any dynamite out on the trail<br/>
anytime soon.<br/>
<br/>
And they can be used for gutting and cleaning fish.  *If* I could catch a<br/>
fish.  I probably don't stand any more of a chance with a fish than I do a<br/>
deer or a beer or a rabbit.<br/>
<br/>
I've also used one to open cans when camping because I forgot the can<br/>
opener.  And I also used one as a screwdriver when I was camping, but I'll<br/>
be darned if I can remember what I needed a screwdriver for at the time.  I<br/>
*do* remember that it didn't really make a very good screwdriver tho.<br/>
<br/>
And isn't there something you do with a knife should you happen to get<br/>
bitten by a rattlesnake while out on the trail?  I seem to remember<br/>
something about that in old movies.<br/>

Knives can be used to make a walking stick or a crutch if needed.  <br/>
Don't even get me started on the things you can do with a good walking <br/>

And, yes, knives can be used to capture and prepare food, or defend <br/>
yourself from something which may fancy you as food, if need be.<br/>

I am not a weekend warrior or some survivalist guru.  I am not a knife <br/>

<br/>
Knives are definitely on my top ten list for medium and long-term <br/>
hiking.  Think about the times when you were searching for a pair of <br/>
scissors for some household task or another.  Now imagine yourself out <br/>
in the woods needing something like a knife and wishing you had packed <br/>
one in with you.<br/>
