My group had the exact same problem posting a new clue last night.  We ended up giving up, saving the clue and were going to try again today.  It also kept telling us the post was a sucess however did not show it posted.  Hope the site gets its TLC today.  BTW H.H.  Up To The Highest Height and HOPE have been obtained and are now contemplating their next resting place.  It might me awhile though, we just got a heap of snow dumped on us last night!<br/>
