                    <div class="plaintext-content">On June 23, 2002 Funhog place the Heron's Haven Letterbox in the town of<br/>
Yarmouthport, Barnstable County, Massachusetts. This letterbox is  hidden<br/>
along one of the Town of Yarmouth's walking trails. As you walk along the<br/>
marsh be on the lookout for egrets and herons. This is a fragile little<br/>
stamp. Please treat it kindly.<br/>
<br/>
To the Trailhead: From Route 6a go north on Homestead Lane across from<br/>
house #365, The Friday Club. The road will curve to the left. Go right on<br/>
Kingsbury for about a block to a small parking area on the right. <br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: <br/>
With a left-hand choice you shall not fail.<br/>
Cross a ramp, grasp a rail.<br/>
<br/>
A narrow path through the trees,<br/>
A right-hand turn, a marshy breeze.<br/>
<br/>
The pathway here is twice as wide,<br/>
A leaning tree just beside.<br/>
<br/>
Its head is gone and roots are showing,<br/>
A friend reclines, don't keep going!<br/>
<br/>
Behind the log and on the ground,<br/>
Beneath some bark, the box is found.<br/>
