<div>Hello all,</div>
<div>    I have been lurking since July.  I stumbled across 
information about the letterboxes Tom Cooch placed in Braintree Vermont.  
It really excited me, I have to say, because I grew up in Braintree and was 
familiar with Rolling Rock, Mud Pond, and The Braintree Panther.  I 
used to spend a lot of time in the woods before I joined the Navy. My daughters 
are just now getting old enough to go hiking. This sounded like the perfect way 
to spend some quality time with them when I'm home.  I have been getting 
the digest version of the mailing list since and read it when I can. I now live 
in Virginia Beach but was planning a trip to Vermont for Labor Day 
weekend.  I really wanted to get started while I was in Vermont but didn't 
find the time to carve a stamp before we left.  Unfortunately the time I 
spent in Vermont didn't include letterboxing.</div>
<div>    Since then I have been trying to come up with a stamp. I 
couldn't decide if I should have a family stamp, a stamp for each of my 
daughters and my own stamp or a combination.  I have 3 year old 
triplet daughters and a five month old daughter. </div>
<div>    Somehow back in September I missed Kathys post that she 
had placed 3 new boxes in Virginia Beach. Last weekend I was reading through the 
archives looking for ideas and found her post.  I was so excited to learn 
of 3 boxes right here in Va Beach! I rushed right out 
and purchased the materials to carve my first stamp.  After 
reading the archives for ideas, I decided on one stamp for my 3 year old 
triplet daughters to start with.  I didn't come up with one for myself yet 
but I couldn't wait any longer.  It was supposed to be a great 
weekend!</div>
<div>    I am happy to report that my triplet daughters and I had 
a wonderful day finding all three of Kathys boxes.  I have lived in 
this area off and on for 14 years and yesterday was the first time I had 
actually been to the Fort Story Lighthouse.  What a neat place! My 
daughters and I even went to the top of the Old Cape Henry Lighthouse.  The 
letterbox had a little water in it but the Zip Lock bag saved the log 
book.  Since this was our first find, and we were the first to find it, I 
didn't know we should have written anything in the log book.  We were also 
the first to find the Long Creek Seahorse.  We didn't sign that one either. 
When we found Broad Bay Sea Shells we saw that two people had been there before 
us and had written in the log book.  Duh!  I felt silly that we hadn't 
signed the first two. It was fun looking at their stamps and reading the notes 
they had written.  I wanted to go back and sign the first two but we 
were already an hour later than I told my wife we would be. We still had an hour 
ahead of us to hike all the way back to the van. Three year olds tend to 
stop and look at everything they find.  I'll go back again soon with some 
friends that I'm trying to get interested in letterboxing. I'll sign the log 
books then. I hope to get some people from the area Multiples Club 
interested and get a lot more "kid friendly" boxes placed in the area.  
Anyway, we had a great time and can't wait to get out and do it again.</div>
<div>    On our way out we met two joggers. It looked like one 
of them was carrying a log book. We didn't get to talk to them but I 
assumed they were looking for Broad Bay Shells.  Was it anyone here on the 
list?</div>
<div>    Thanks again everyone and especially to Tom and 
Kathy for getting us started.  We will be in Vermont again the first week 
of December. Hope to look for some of Toms boxes then.</div>

<div>Congratulations on finding 
your first letterboxes. The next closest boxes to you is my Mystery box, and the 
the boxes in Fredericksburg and Northern VA. I just got Squirel's Huntley 
Meadows Boxes in Alex. All of hers up this way are great. I have another going 
on the web tomorrow in the Accotink Bay W.R. Fort Belvior...</div>

&gt; Hi Mark,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Great to hear from you. Are you Reggie Magnant's brother? Reggie <br/>
took <br/>
&gt; algebra from me at RUHS about 15 years ago. Very small world.<br/>
<br/>
Hi Tom,<br/>
   Yes, I am Regie Magnant's brother. It is a very small world. I <br/>
think my brother in law's (Greg Flint) grandmother lives near you. <br/>
I'm coming up in December mainly for deer hunting so I hope there's <br/>
lots of snow. My girls don't get to see a lot of snow living in <br/>
Virginia.  They have never even been on a snowmobile. I will <br/>
definitely look for the Kimbal Letterbook but I hope to search for <br/>
all the letterboxes in Braintree.  I'd love to pick up a Virginia <br/>
hitchiker looking for a ride to Vermont!<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for your post about your adventure finding the three Virginia <br/>
Beach boxes.  What an adventure it must have been with three little <br/>
ones in tow!  I'll be down there in late October and will look <br/>
forward to checking in on the boxes and discovering what stamps you <br/>
came up with for your girls.  Those three boxes were fun for me to <br/>
plant, not only because they were my first, but in doing so I <br/>
discovered Fort Story quite by accident.  I was lost looking for the <br/>
State Park and stumbled onto Fort Story and the lighthouses and the <br/>
most wonderful sunrise.  I decided then I'd have to carve a stamp for <br/>
a Fort Story Box.  It is a great spot.<br/>
<br/>
Have you checked out the clues to the boxes at the York River State <br/>
Park in Williamsburg.  Actually, they were my first to hunt for, and <br/>
Box 1 was missing then, but we were able to find Box 2.  I planted <br/>
one in Shenandoah National Park this past weekend and will be posting <br/>
the clues later this week.  It was quite a hike...one you might not <br/>
be able to take the girls on.  I'll be happy to tell you more about <br/>
that if you plan to be up that way.  Thanks to the other "Virginia <br/>
letterboxers", there are many more to find in northern Virginia, and <br/>
be sure to check out Jay Chamberlain's mystery box...that was fun!  <br/>
I've got several planned for Richmond in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
Stay busy and you may get your wish for a hitch hiker to take to <br/>
Vermont with you, as Jay has just hidden one, and I recently received <br/>
the Star Trek Voyager from a fellow letterboxer from RI which I'll <br/>
find a spot for soon.  So, good luck, have fun and be safe!<br/>
