<div>Todd,  we have only been letterboxing 6 months 
but have visited some great places thanks to this new activity.  Magu Peak 
was our 4th Box.  It was an exhilarating view  and we were stoked to be the first ones to the box when we 
visited on Jan.6th. The hike was long in terms of others we had done, BUT certainly not 
difficult.  We understood that the hike 
would be longish and planned accordingly.  Please reconsider putting Magu 
back on the Clue list,  It is too good to not be there for 
others.    We have recommended the 
hike to other "boxers" as the best in Pacific views in So. 
Cal.    We checked out clues to Superstition Box and decided that 
we would leave that one for the younger folks, as we felt the difficulty was 
over our heads.  That does not mean that others would find it 
so.  Letterboxing should not be 
all vanilla.   We are off to Los Osos and Vacaville to try for 
some boxes up north, but meanwhile thanks 
for Magu!      Gwen and Don from So. 
Cal.<span id="__#Ath#SignaturePos__"></span></div></body></html>
