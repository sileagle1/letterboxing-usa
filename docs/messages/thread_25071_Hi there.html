We are new to letterboxing.  I ran across a side note in an MSN article about a week ago and had never even heard of this.  I did a little research and got very interested.  My kids are designing stamps right now and are excited to start a new adventure.  We are headed to Durango CO for a ride on the train this weekend and I was hoping we could find one there that someone would recomend for a starter box.  I found the list and there are a lot on there.  We haven't sold dad on this adventure and if a side trip to look for a box messes up the schedule too much it may be a much harder sale.  Could someone recomend one that would be good for a first timer?  I posted on the Rocky mountain site too, not knowing how much overlap there is between the two and hedging my bets a little.  <br/>
<br/>
I am also looking for any advice anyone wants to give someone just starting out.  <br/>

DEFINITELY - read the code of conduct!! You will then get a better sense of the whole philosophy of boxing. Welcome! <br/>

&gt; Welcome to letterboxing Angie, and good luck getting hubby to join in.  It's a great family hobby or activity or whatever you want to call it.  My advice is to find several boxes before you make and place your own.  Be sure to hide the boxes you find back completely out of sight, don't leave a corner sticking out in an attempt to help the next person find the box - they are supposed to be completely hidden from view so that non-letterboxers don't find them by accident.  Try to access the boxes you find out of sight of non-letterboxers, especially when you are retrieving a box and/or putting it back in its hiding spot - if other people see you they may do mischief to the box you were looking at after you have left the area.  Don't be discouraged if you can't find a box - there are tons of them to look for, just try again for a different box.  Sometimes a box goes missing but the clues remain for years for lack of updating, although most people try to edit their clues once they find that a box belonging to them has disappeared.  It's possible that what you couldn't find is simply not there anymore.  Have a story in mind to tell folks who might see you poking around in the bushes and ask what you're doing - looking for a contact, taking notes on mushroom types, something like that.  Check out lbna.org and atlasquest.com and read anything you can find for newbies before you go out so you have a general idea of letterboxing etiquette.  Most of all, have a wonderful time and enjoy yourself - I've made some very good friends letterboxing, and you probably will too if you make any effort at all.  atlasquest has a listing of events, and if you find one near you and attend you will be glad you did. <br/>

The best advice I can give you is to just get out there and do it.<br/>
<br/>
Don't sweat the details, if you don't have a stamp or logbook yet, don't <br/>
worry about it.  Just read over a few clues, pick a few that seem to fit <br/>
you, and go find the boxes.  Far too many folks spend all kinds of time <br/>
and energy finding out every detail of letterboxing before they even <br/>
step into the woods only to find they have no interest in it, or their <br/>
kids are bored with it.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is essentially pretty straight forward, you will get how it <br/>
is done.  Find the box, stamp the stamps, hide the box, enjoy the trip.<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking for more information, start with you regional list, <br/>
that is usually the best place to find it.  Stay away from the newboxers <br/>
group and don't worry about some contrived code of conduct, they are <br/>
just folks trying to tell you what they think letterboxing should be, <br/>
and really it is something different to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and I hope you have a good time.<br/>

Welcome to Letterboxing!  I've missed the previous responses to your post, but the one from Nathan came through today.<br/>
<br/>
As for me, I ENJOY the Newboxers group, so please just pick and choose what you want to do.  As you can see, as in every other subject, there can be just as many different opinions as there are participants!  (I've been letterboxing about 18 months.)<br/>
<br/>
I began letterboxing with my kids first, locally, and it took several tries before we had a find.  Our first find took place on a vacation trip with my husband along, and thankfully, we DID find one (the first) out of the four we searched for.<br/>
<br/>
Even with the ones we didn't find, two led us on beautiful walks which we would never have taken, had we not been letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
ENJOY the JOURNEY.... it isn't just about the destination.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun in Colorado!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
