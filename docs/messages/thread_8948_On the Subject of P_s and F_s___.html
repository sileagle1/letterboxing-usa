clues.  Sometimes people put them in their own plastic containers, <br/>
sometimes the stamps and log book are just wrapped in a baggie.<br/>
<br/>
They get placed with an existing letterbox -- if it is just a baggie, <br/>
put them inside the existing box, if it is its own container, put it <br/>
in the same hiding spot.<br/>
<br/>
They should be stamped into the box where you put them...  in other <br/>
words, stamp the hitcher stamp into the log book of the host box and <br/>
the host box stamp into the hitcher log book.<br/>
<br/>
As for notification...  You do not HAVE to notify anyone.  But there <br/>
are several avenues that can be used for notification.  Pete and <br/>
Wanda keep a comprehensive hitcher list on their web page <br/>
(http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html) or there is a <br/>
separate Yahoo talk list some people use for hitchhikers <br/>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox_travellers/?yguid=120115296) <br/>
or other people just post it to this list.<br/>
<br/>
If you are the person who originally planted the hitcher, then you <br/>
get to count it as a "P".  When you find and move a hitcher, it is <br/>
an "F".<br/>

<br/>
Randy Hall once wrote me that a box does not need to be listed on the <br/>
letterboxing site to be a box or a P.  It can be listed on another <br/>
site, on the Geocaching site, in a list of boxes given to your <br/>
friends...  As long as it contains the ingredients for a box and a <br/>
set of clues (or not if it is a hitchhiker) <br/>
<br/>
I admit I don't like to get very far into the legalities of the Ps <br/>
and Fs.   I have enough trouble trying to track where I am at any <br/>
given moment.  I tend to count up before events and once or twice a <br/>
year otherwise.  <br/>
<br/>
I wrote a little piece of some humor on this topic about 9 months ago <br/>
which you might enjoy at this time:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.qsl.net/ws8g/pfxe.htm<br/>
<br/>
Also, I use the FAQs by Randy whenever I get into a different sort of <br/>
unusual situation and need to know how the "framers" might have <br/>
thought of a new idea.  Perhaps we need letterbox lawyers and a court <br/>
system, or decree by a monarch who has unquestioned authority.  <br/>
Perhaps not.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are feeling bold, try this test:  Guess what your PF scores <br/>
are and put those numbers at the bottom of a post as though they are <br/>
completely correct.  Don't tell *anyone* that the numbers might be <br/>
off a tad.  If it makes you feel bad, or you receive abundant <br/>
criticism about your lack of accuracy, then look up the rules and pay <br/>
attention to the details. <br/>

Enjoy the woods in the absence of poison ivy this winter. <br/>

<div>OK - just to muddy the 
waters further... how do others count exchanges? I thought this question had an 
obvious answer until I went to a couple of gatherings and came across the 
following scenarios:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1 person with 1 stamp = 1 
exchange</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1 person with Y stamps = 1 exchange or Y exchanges? (I'm 
counting 1)</div>
<div> </div>
<div> X people with 1 stamp when all X's are present= 1 exchange or X 
exchanges (e.g., a family) (I'm counting 1)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>X people with 1 stamp when 
only some of the X's are present= 1 or (X-Y)? (I'm counting 1)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>X people with Y stamps when 
Y&gt;X (we exchange with our "family" stamp and our individual stamps so Y=X+1) 
(I'm counting X)</div>
<div>
<div> </div>
<div>1 dog with 1 stamp = 1 exchange? (I'm counting 1)</div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>1 soft toy with 1 stamp = 1 
exchange? (I'm counting 1 - but only if the soft toy in question has its own 
personality :-)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>X people and Z dogs with 1 
stamp? (I'm counting 1)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>X people and Z dogs 
with Y stamps? (who the hell knows!?)</div>
<div> </div></div></div>
<div>X people and Z dogs and Q 
soft toys with N stamps? (who the hell knows!?)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>Urrghhhh!!!! I stopped 
counting after the second gathering because it all got too confusing and decided 
I'd stick to my P's and F's! I guess it all boils down to the question of whether an exchange is 
literally a stamp exchange or a people 
(entity) exchange.</div></div>

<br/>
A letterbox doesn't have to be on this website to count as a <br/>
placed.  An "undocumented" clue is still a clue, no matter where <br/>
you find it.  I have clues listed on my website that I've delibrately <br/>
not had placed on the website for whatever reason.  Others <br/>
believe just finding the CLUE is part of the challenge in <br/>
letterboxing, and want to make it more difficult just to adquire the <br/>
clue.  I've had to hike to one of my own letterboxes before just to <br/>
adquire a clue that I knew somebody had placed there.<br/>
<br/>
But they're all still clues that lead to letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which--there are plenty of 'undocumented' clues <br/>
floating around, which is a good reason to get to know some of <br/>
the local letterboxers because they might know of some that you <br/>
may not know about!<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking about creating some clues that are meant to <br/>
be mailed or given to people.  Maybe I'll print out half a dozen of <br/>
them and hand them out--then if you want to find the box, you <br/>
need to find someone who's walking around with one of them.  <br/>
Just to make things a little more challenging.  =)<br/>

For what it's worth, I just count how many stamps I've aquired <br/>
from other people because, well, it's easier that way.  But count it <br/>
any way that seems right to you.  There aren't rules about this <br/>
sort of thing!<br/>

You CAN get Poison Ivy even in the winter.  It is the sap and not the leaves which do you in.  Please be careful no matter when you go.  My brother had the worst case ever one winter after a camping trip.<br/>

want our hitch hikers added to any list kept by<br/>
another. <br/>
<br/>
I have included an email address in each of my<br/>
hitchhikers with a note asking that the finder please<br/>
email me to let me know of the condition.  That way if<br/>
I have further questions or concerns about the upkeep<br/>
of the box I can address them to the person who knows<br/>
best about my HH. <br/>
<br/>
Please follow whatever directions for notification you<br/>
find with the HH and please let the person know you<br/>
found it if they ask- that's half the fun! :o)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; As for notification...  You do not HAVE to notify<br/>
&gt; anyone.  But there <br/>
&gt; are several avenues that can be used for<br/>
&gt; notification.  Pete and <br/>
&gt; Wanda keep a comprehensive hitcher list on their web<br/>
&gt; page <br/>
&gt; (http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html) or<br/>
&gt; there is a <br/>
&gt; separate Yahoo talk list some people use for<br/>
&gt; hitchhikers <br/>
&gt;<br/>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox_travellers/?yguid=120115296)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; or other people just post it to this list.<br/>
