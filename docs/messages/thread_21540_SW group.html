I didn't see a SouthWest group listed either.  Try going to the <br/>
LB.org site and contacting an AZ placer - esp. one in the area you <br/>
are visiting.<br/>

I don't think there are any SW letterbox groups, though I know several<br/>
letterboxers from Arizona and Nevada that frequently visit the<br/>
Southern California talk list (found at<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxing-socal/ ) seeing as that's<br/>
the nearest geographical region that does have a talk list to those areas.<br/>
<br/>
You could also try Atlas Quest since it has a message board for every<br/>
state including Arizona, though I'm not sure many Arizonians are using<br/>
it.  (But then again, I'm not sure there are many Arizonian<br/>
letterboxers in the first place!)<br/>
<br/>
For what it's worth, there's a box I planted not far from Hoover Dam<br/>
that's just awesome.  ;o) Got a few others not far from the Four<br/>
Corners area as well, though at least one of them is probably missing.<br/>
<br/>
The Tuscon area has some WONDERFUL ideas for planting boxes!  I really<br/>
liked Tuscon.  At least in the winter time, I liked it.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>
