This afternoon Don and Gwen's well-traveled Hitch Hiker, Honor Liberty found it's <br/>
latest temporary home in Portland. It is residing quiety in the vacant home of Tribute. <br/>
Although the box by Wingnut appears to be MIA, I could think of no more appropriate <br/>
place to leave this HH. A gentle sweep of loose dirt will reveal the box.<br/>
<br/>
For those who are not familiar with Honor Liberty, it is meant to be moved as quickly <br/>
as possible. To facilitate this, Don and Gwen have requested that it's hiding places be <br/>
posted on the chat lists. It is currently beginning it's third year of travels. <br/>
<br/>
Since Tribute is missing, I was unable to stamp its image into the HH logbook. If the <br/>
person who picks up this hitcher has a copy of the stamp, it would be wonderful if <br/>
they scanned the image and pasted it into the book. If you need a copy, I can make a <br/>
scan at my end and email it to you. Wingnut could probably do the same. Pick up this <br/>
touching stamp! Funhog<br/>
