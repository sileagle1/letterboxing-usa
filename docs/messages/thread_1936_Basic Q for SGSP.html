I'm not so sure that is true, Aili. My kids and I tried for the Burnham <br/>
Brook Letterbox on our very first attempt last June without success. We had <br/>
read an article in the Norwich Bulletin about letterboxing in general, and <br/>
the Burnham Brook one in particular. We rushed out that day, without a <br/>
compass of course, and after much time wasted at an earlier spot that <br/>
seemed to match the description, we found the area we believed the box to <br/>
be in. My attempts at judging the proper degree by the sun were just off <br/>
enough to put us in the wrong area. After nearly an hour of tramping around <br/>
without success, we left, more determined than ever to find one.<br/>
<br/>
I think the anticipation of finding it had us hooked long before the <br/>
failure to find it. That and the picnic lunch while dangling our feet in <br/>
the brook may have done the trick. I suspect that the thrill of the hunt <br/>
will be enough. Especially when combined with a liking of hiking :-)<br/>
