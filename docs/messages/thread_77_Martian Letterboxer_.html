                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everybody.  I was out of town for a few days and finally caught up <br/>
with recent postings.  I'm excited by all the great ideas for the Kids' <br/>
Page and last night came up with one of my own:  If Winnie the Pooh and <br/>
friends aren't quite right for the letterboxing age group, how about <br/>
making up our own characters?  I'm thinking of a Martian who lands on <br/>
earth and is discovered and befriended by a girl and boy who are out <br/>
letterboxing. He (the Martian) doesn't know anything about letterboxing <br/>
nor even much about life as a kid on earth, so they have to explain <br/>
their world, and especially letterboxing, to him.  He needs to learn how <br/>
to read a map, follow clues, make stamps, write messages, etc.  Those of <br/>
you with children can probably ask them to help flesh out the <br/>
personalities, likes/dislikes, enthusiasms, perspective on grown-ups, <br/>
etc., of the two Earth kids.  What do you think?  --Bonnie<br/>

<br/>
BUT, and I hesitate here because I may be about to offend someone, I don't<br/>
want to talk about kids letterboxing nearly as much as I want to spend time<br/>
on grown-ups putting those boxes out!!!  The page is terrific for kids--now<br/>
can we talk about what's holding people up when it comes to getting boxes<br/>
out there for the rest of us to find?  For me it is finding good nooks in<br/>
public places with interesting surroundings--but I'm finding a few!<br/>
Yesterday I checked my boxes 1 &amp; 2 and found that 2 was getting moisture in<br/>
it somehow.  I brought it home, I'm putting the contents in a different box<br/>
and I'll put it back in the same spot later today.  Meanwhile I'm scouting<br/>
for a place for #4 which is almost ready...once the series of 6 is done<br/>
along Duck Creek, I'm going to write it up for the local paper (since I<br/>
have a column, why not?) and let people know what's happening.  I'd love to<br/>
be able to say there are a whole bunch of boxes in the DFW area of Texas<br/>
(HINT HINT, again--or is it NAG NAG?)...<br/>
<br/>
I love to see this take shape and grow!<br/>

Want to buy a book?  I'm trying to make a life-long dream come true and<br/>
open a bookshop.  It's tiny, but it grows now and then.  Come see!<br/>

Re: Julie's comments about moisture in boxes:  I've found that some<br/>
Rubbermaid containers, when squeezed, exude a bit of air if you listen<br/>
closely, others don't - with either the blue cover ones or the white<br/>
cover ones. I tested a "burping" one and another, good one, by weighting<br/>
them down in a dishpan,for several hours - neither leaked a bit. My<br/>
conclusion - temperature and/or pressure changes mean moist air moves in<br/>
and out in the burpers, so...<br/>
1) Baggies in the box!...and<br/>
2) test by burping before you buy.<br/>
<br/>
Its also possible that a bit of grit got into the seal area to provide a<br/>
water path - I guess, engourage finders to wipe out this area and seal<br/>
tightly?<br/>
