article on the most notable trees  and there were some very nice <br/>
references to eastern Ct. trees that are spectacular. Thought it <br/>
might inspire an addition to your notable series.  This was the <br/>
outdoor  writer Peter marteka's latest article.  Mentions Ashford Oak <br/>
which has a nice box already.   Have a great day all. I'm done school <br/>
and have boxing on the mind.    Carol<br/>
