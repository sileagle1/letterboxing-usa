                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Chimney Rock Letterbox was placed on 9/20/01 by Funhog near the town<br/>
of Prineville in Crook County, Oregon. This area has a series of<br/>
primitive BLM campgrounds nestled in a beautiful desert canyon<br/>
alongside the Crooked River. The fishing and birding are good here and<br/>
the hike to the letterbox can be done in all four seasons. The roundtrip<br/>
is about four miles with a 500 ft. elevation gain.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: In the center of downtown Prineville go South toward<br/>
Bowman Dam on highway 27/Main Street. Just past mile marker 16 you will<br/>
find the parking area for the Chimney Rock Day Use Area. The Rim<br/>
Trailhead is on the opposite side of the road.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: Follow the trail up the canyon, past a dry waterfall<br/>
to a wooden bench. On a clear day you will have a great view of the<br/>
Crooked River Canyon and the Cascade Range from this point. As you<br/>
proceed on the trail you will pass a standing snag on your right. Watch<br/>
for a scattered pile of dead wood on the right side of the trail. Just<br/>
beyond this point you will have your first glimpse of Chimney Rock.<br/>
Stop! You will be standing between two juniper trees. Go right from the<br/>
trail until you see the Rock framed between two trees at 142 degrees.<br/>
Look left. Look down. See that lichen covered rock leaning against that<br/>
juniper? Voila...<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails, Funhog<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for placing many boxes.  I wonder if I'll ever get to Central Oregon<br/>
to check out yours and Ryan's boxes there.  Time seems not my own lately and<br/>
letterboxing has taken the backburner.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you liked Horsethief Lake letterbox.  Sorry about that campground.<br/>
It is pretty cramped and not my type of place to enjoy the outdoors.  More<br/>
like a rowdy trailer park.  We just went on a day trip there.  Another<br/>
campground a little further down the road is Maryhill State Park, closer to<br/>
the Columbia River, but it doesn't look much better as far as I can tell.<br/>
Crowe Butte is pretty good, though.  I stayed there a few years back.  It's<br/>
further East more toward the Tri-Cities at Umatilla Basin.  <br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On October 17, 2001 Funhog placed the Crystal Springs letterbox at <br/>
Crystal Springs Rhododendron Gardens in the City of Portland, Multnomah <br/>
County, Oregon. The Gardens are lovely any time of year. In the Spring <br/>
and Summer there are the flowers and in the Fall and Winter this is a <br/>
prime spot for migratory ducks. Bring cracked corn (bread is a no-no.) <br/>
Admission is free September to March and on Tuesdays and Wednesdays the <br/>
rest of the year.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: <br/>
The Gardens are located across from Reed College on SE 28th between <br/>
Woodstock and Holgate.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
With water on your right and a low stone wall on your left you will <br/>
come to a Cornelian Cherry Dogwood tree. You are almost there. From the <br/>
letterbox you will see a sand trap at 190 degrees and a pair of willow <br/>
trees leaning out over the water at 290 degrees. A few loose stones <br/>
cover the box. Happy trails...<br/>
