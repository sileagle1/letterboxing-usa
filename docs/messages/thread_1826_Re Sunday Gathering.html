<br/>
Let me just say that the CT letterboxing gathering on Sunday was, in my <br/>
humble estimation, one terrific event! Its informal atmosphere, sense of fun <br/>
and community, and just plain niceness were especially noteworthy. Special <br/>
thanks go out to Carolyn - who is such a dynamo! - for putting the whole <br/>
darned thing together, and to Beth, the soup-er cook extraordinaire! I <br/>
particularly enjoyed meeting - and exchanging stamps with - many of the <br/>
people whose names regularly appear on this list and whose stamps show up so <br/>
often in the letterboxes around here...folks like the Four-Hearted Fittons, <br/>
ESAK (Elmer and family), the Elements of Hiking (such a cool name!), SPike <br/>
and MPike, Dan &amp; Melissa, Deena and Shelley Durant. And, of course, the gurus <br/>
of CT letterboxing, Eric "The Ram" Eurto and the Drew Clan (Jay and company). <br/>
I know there were several other fellow letterboxers whom I met but whose <br/>
names I cannot recall at the moment (which should perhaps come as no surprise <br/>
to those who stayed long enough to play Carolyn's "I Opened My Grandmother's <br/>
Backpack and Took Out a..." game); thanks to all of you for being there, too! <br/>
<br/>
I also hope that lots of people took the opportunity to look at Space <br/>
Traveler Judi's stamps from her letterboxing adventures in Dartmoor. Quite an <br/>
awesome array, that!<br/>
<br/>
As for me, I'm more eager than ever to get back out on the trails and find <br/>
many more leterboxes (lists, I'm making lists), and I've even started to <br/>
think about planting one sometime soon. I'm also looking forward to the next <br/>
Gathering of the Tribes of Letterboxers (how about a summer <br/>
picnic/get-together at one of our state parks, preferably one with several <br/>
letterboxes in it?).<br/>
