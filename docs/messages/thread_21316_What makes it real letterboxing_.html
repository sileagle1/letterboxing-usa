Just recently, our son--a full-grown adult sort of guy--emailed us <br/>
that he and his wife were going to start letterboxing this past <br/>
weekend. We asked if they had their own stamp, a logbook, etc. The <br/>
reply came back that they were just going to look for boxes, that <br/>
it's not about the stamps anyway, that it's about the adventure of <br/>
finding the boxes.<br/>
   Our reply was that it certainly is about the stamps (as well as <br/>
the adventure), that the stamps are the evidence that you've found <br/>
the boxes, that they're the evidence of the adventure.<br/>
   Boyo says says that his memory is the evidence of the adventure.<br/>
   Nadine and I say that the planter of the box has done so in the <br/>
expectation of ending up with a logbook full of the stamps of that <br/>
box's finders. If you don't leave a stamp, you're kind of cheating <br/>
the planter. (Boyo never said whether they'd sign the logs or not.) <br/>
Nadine says that if you don't leave and take stamp impressions, that <br/>
you're just digging around in the bushes, that you're missing the <br/>

<br/>
  I agree with Nadine and Frank. Though the planters would never know <br/>
that these two had been there and therefore wouldn't know they'd been <br/>
cheated, they'd still have been cheated. There is a kind of compact <br/>
amongst letterboxers - clues are provided in the expectation that <br/>
finders will stamp in. That's one of the main points of the <br/>
game's/hobby's design - a design that incorporates both planter and <br/>
finder, not just one of them. If you simply want to find a spot, pick a <br/>
point on a map and see if you can get there - solve a crossword before <br/>
you go if you want a puzzle. Or they could write clues for each other <br/>
if it's the challenge they want.<br/>
<br/>
That said, maybe they'd be willing to 'stamp in' with a fingerprint? <br/>
It's not exactly a stamp, but with a note, it'd at least let the <br/>
planter find a record of who had been to the box. Even a store-bought <br/>
stamp would only take a few minutes to enter into the logbook and it'd <br/>
surely be preferable to nothing. If they dont' want their own logbook, <br/>
so be it, but my vote is that they stamp in somehow.<br/>
<br/>
.00004 of a cent on a good day, really. :-)<br/>

What's the point if you're not going to stamp in?  If you want to <br/>
hike, get a hiking book (I have a few!).  If you want to see urban <br/>
places of interest, get a guide book.  It sounds like they want to <br/>
have the fun of letterboxing without the "work" and without the <br/>
social aspect.  And are they going to reciprocate with boxes of their <br/>
own or are they just going to find and not plant?  That's a little <br/>
selfish, don't ya think?<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of ways to play this game and what makes it fun is <br/>
seeing how others play.  But how can we see how you play if you don't <br/>
let us know that you ARE playing?<br/>

or note that makes it complete! It is kind of unfair to the placer. They have <br/>
placed the box there for the enjoyment of others and in return their enjoyment <br/>
is your stamp. It's like playing soccer, basketball or another sport and <br/>
deciding not to kick it in the goal or basketball in the hoop,  that is the point <br/>
to score to stamp etc...but there are always those who do not want to follow <br/>
the rules....<br/>

I don't think we have enough info to form an opinion.   Perhaps they aren't ready to make <br/>
a commitment to this obsession, er hobby.  You did say he was a sortof grown man.  <br/>
Maybe they need to see for themselves how others do it, so as not to come up short of <br/>
someone's expectations (wink, wink)?  Is their intent good?  I would want to know where <br/>
they "didn't letterbox properly", just in case they planned to do harm to letterboxes.  Not <br/>
accusing them, but a few evildoers have been known to find boxes and "leave no trace."  <br/>
Keep us posted when they discover the fun of Real Letterboxing.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] What makes it real letterboxing?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just recently, our son--a full-grown adult sort of guy--emailed us <br/>
that he and his wife were going to start letterboxing this past <br/>
weekend. We asked if they had their own stamp, a logbook, etc. The <br/>
reply came back that they were just going to look for boxes, that <br/>
it's not about the stamps anyway, that it's about the adventure of <br/>
finding the boxes.<br/>
   Our reply was that it certainly is about the stamps (as well as <br/>
the adventure), that the stamps are the evidence that you've found <br/>
the boxes, that they're the evidence of the adventure.<br/>
   Boyo says says that his memory is the evidence of the adventure.<br/>
   Nadine and I say that the planter of the box has done so in the <br/>
expectation of ending up with a logbook full of the stamps of that <br/>
box's finders. If you don't leave a stamp, you're kind of cheating <br/>
the planter. (Boyo never said whether they'd sign the logs or not.) <br/>
Nadine says that if you don't leave and take stamp impressions, that <br/>
you're just digging around in the bushes, that you're missing the <br/>
point. Frank always agrees with Nadine.<br/>
   Now Nadine and I are curious about your reactions. So what do you <br/>
think--are Boyo and Wifey simply wrong (or wrong-headed), or are <br/>
Nadine and Frank entirely too traditional and by-the-book?<br/>

Solving the intriguing clue, experiencing an interesting hike we <br/>

little known tidbit of history about a region, capstoned with the <br/>
reward of a unique handcarved stamp in your 'Indiana Jones style' <br/>

what kind of what does it for us.  Knowing that only a tiny fraction <br/>

placers leave empty boxes?  Just some sort of symbol<br/>

<br/>
If someone takes the time to carve a stamp, choose a<br/>
location they want to share with others, then select a<br/>
clever hiding place and write the clues, they deserve<br/>
a little something to "thank" them - a mark to<br/>
indicate that someone else was sufficiently enticed to<br/>
go out and find it.  Kind of an artistic "thumbs up." <br/>
No question - store bought is better than nothing.<br/>
<br/>
In a way, it's like going to a very nice restaurant,<br/>
getting outstanding service, enjoying the food, then<br/>
slipping out without tipping.  <br/>
<br/>
Knowing that we are all hiders and seekers, and<br/>
remembering those pre-LB times when we were ignorant<br/>
and uninformed of what was right under our noses, part<br/>
of the thrill is the secret we all share and the<br/>
little bits of treasure we give to and take from each<br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, they are cheating the placer, but it's also like<br/>
they are spying on us - seeing if we really exist. <br/>
Eavesdropping on a whispered secret.  And really, they<br/>
cheat themselves too because by being invisible they<br/>
don't get to be a part of the inner secret.<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER, I wouldn't fault them for trying it out JUST<br/>
to see if it is really out there.  I would hope that<br/>
the find would inspire them to dig a little deeper,<br/>
expand themselves to get the whole experience.  Maybe<br/>
it's not about the stamps for them - so let them use<br/>
store-bought (but let's not start THAT debate up<br/>
again!).  Maybe, with a little guidance from Wiser<br/>
Ones, they will find their way into it if they aren't<br/>
pushed away for their approach.<br/>

  What's the point if you're not going to stamp in?  If you want to<br/>
  hike, get a hiking book (I have a few!).  If you want to see urban<br/>
  places of interest, get a guide book.  It sounds like they want to<br/>
  have the fun of letterboxing without the "work" and without the<br/>
  social aspect.  And are they going to reciprocate with boxes of their<br/>
  own or are they just going to find and not plant?  That's a little<br/>
  selfish, don't ya think?<br/>
<br/>
  There are a lot of ways to play this game and what makes it fun is<br/>
  seeing how others play.  But how can we see how you play if you don't<br/>
  let us know that you ARE playing?<br/>

&gt; &gt; something to ponder on nights that I'm walking the<br/>
&gt; &gt; floors because I can't<br/>
&gt; &gt; sleep. Just WHO is peeking in to my boxes and not<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamping in.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Relax all. It's just a game.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   What's the point if you're not going to stamp<br/>
&gt; in? <br/>
&gt; &gt; If you want to<br/>
&gt; &gt;   hike, get a hiking book (I have a few!).  If you<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to see urban<br/>
&gt; &gt;   places of interest, get a guide book.  It sounds<br/>
&gt; &gt; like they want to<br/>
&gt; &gt;   have the fun of letterboxing without the "work"<br/>
&gt; &gt; and without the<br/>
&gt; &gt;   social aspect.  And are they going to<br/>
&gt; reciprocate<br/>
&gt; &gt; with boxes of their<br/>
&gt; &gt;   own or are they just going to find and not<br/>
&gt; plant? <br/>
&gt; &gt; That's a little<br/>
&gt; &gt;   selfish, don't ya think?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   There are a lot of ways to play this game and<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; makes it fun is<br/>
&gt; &gt;   seeing how others play.  But how can we see how<br/>
&gt; &gt; you play if you don't<br/>
&gt; &gt;   let us know that you ARE playing?<br/>

My thought on this would be that if Boyo and Wifey choose not to <br/>
have a stamp or keep a logbook themselves, that's their choice, but <br/>
I think they should at least give the letterbox the courtesy of a <br/>
simple sign-in of some sort - just their names in pen to show the <br/>
owner that they'd been there and found the box. (Unless of course <br/>
they don't even open the container to see the contents....)  I hope <br/>
they care enough to "rehide well"!!<br/>

Great, my first posting and I'm feeling the need to say stop <br/>
imposing your ideas on the boyo.  It's difficult not to when you're <br/>
super enthused over this kind of hobby, but maybe they gain <br/>
enjoyment in a different way or want to develop their ideas of the <br/>
letterboxing as something they created.  <br/>
<br/>
Hubby and I had a hard time wrapping our understanding around the <br/>
concept when someone tried explaining letterboxing to us. <br/>
Repeatedly.  So, we trudged through the parks looking for a local <br/>
box or two to see how it was done.  What kind of stamps?  Are store <br/>
bought acceptable?  What do people say?  Do they sign there names? <br/>
Or do they use aliases? There are a ton of questions.<br/>
<br/>
During the search, we realized we enjoyed the walk in the park.  We <br/>
had a great time together, away from the office, the phones, the tv, <br/>
and our busy lives. We liked the anonymity of leaving a message.  <br/>
Also the thrill of the search.  Sometimes, albeit rare, we don't <br/>
like the tone of the planter or the box and therefore, we leave <br/>
behind no mark.  Yet, we still enjoyed the hike, the search and <br/>
such - that planter gave us a nice moment.  <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate that anyone signs any of my hidden treasures, but if <br/>
they didn't and I thought they had a nice hike or had nearly as much <br/>
fun as I did in preparing and planting the box, then I'm glad to <br/>
have brought that bit of fun to someone else - even anonymously.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Frank and Nadine:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don't think we have enough info to form an opinion.   Perhaps <br/>
they aren't ready to make <br/>
&gt; a commitment to this obsession, er hobby.  You did say he was a <br/>
sortof grown man.  <br/>
&gt; Maybe they need to see for themselves how others do it, so as not <br/>
to come up short of <br/>
&gt; someone's expectations (wink, wink)?  Is their intent good?  I <br/>
would want to know where <br/>
&gt; they "didn't letterbox properly", just in case they planned to do <br/>
harm to letterboxes.  Not <br/>
&gt; accusing them, but a few evildoers have been known to find boxes <br/>
and "leave no trace."  <br/>
&gt; Keep us posted when they discover the fun of Real Letterboxing.<br/>

Alright, blindfold me, spin me around and beat me with a stick.  I <br/>
don't see a real problem with it.  If they enjoy boxing enough, I <br/>
think that they'll eventually come up to speed and get some sort of <br/>
stamp or sign in or something. I think that it is far more important <br/>
that they respect the letterboxes and the time and effort that people <br/>
have invested in them and handle them with care, rehiding them well. <br/>
Perhaps they find the clue based letterbox a more interesting find <br/>
than a goecache. I am a letterboxer, primarily, but I have found a <br/>
number of virtual geocaches, as well as a few standard, in my area. I <br/>
have loved the virtuals because of the places I've been and the <br/>
things I've seen. I did not create an account with one of the <br/>
geocaching groups and log my finds. I suppose it seems that I'm <br/>
cheating the creator of the cache. Yet, still, I don't own a GPS and <br/>
don't consider myself a geocacher.  Perhaps when I feel a part of <br/>
that club, I will do things properly.<br/>

&gt; Just recently, our son--a full-grown adult sort of guy--emailed us <br/>
&gt; that he and his wife were going to start letterboxing this past <br/>
&gt; weekend. We asked if they had their own stamp, a logbook, etc. The <br/>
&gt; reply came back that they were just going to look for boxes, that <br/>
&gt; it's not about the stamps anyway, that it's about the adventure of <br/>
&gt; finding the boxes.<br/>
&gt;    Our reply was that it certainly is about the stamps (as well as <br/>
&gt; the adventure), that the stamps are the evidence that you've found <br/>
&gt; the boxes, that they're the evidence of the adventure.<br/>
&gt;    Boyo says says that his memory is the evidence of the adventure.<br/>
&gt;    Nadine and I say that the planter of the box has done so in the <br/>
&gt; expectation of ending up with a logbook full of the stamps of that <br/>
&gt; box's finders. If you don't leave a stamp, you're kind of cheating <br/>
&gt; the planter. (Boyo never said whether they'd sign the logs or not.) <br/>
&gt; Nadine says that if you don't leave and take stamp impressions, <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; you're just digging around in the bushes, that you're missing the <br/>
&gt; point. Frank always agrees with Nadine.<br/>
&gt;    Now Nadine and I are curious about your reactions. So what do <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; think--are Boyo and Wifey simply wrong (or wrong-headed), or are <br/>
&gt; Nadine and Frank entirely too traditional and by-the-book?<br/>
