                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah,  I agree with the note about tolerance--but in Steve's defense, he'd <br/>
first replied to the guy's question by suggesting he go to the Yahoo group <br/>
website and follow the directions there--which I thought was a helpful bit of <br/>
advice.  The guy replied: "Thanks Steve S. - You've been lots and lots of help. If <br/>
anyone else has any more specific info or a link on where to go or an e-mail <br/>
address to unsubscribe i'd apprciate it."  Then Steve pretty much replied in <br/>
kind.  Actually, I was impressed that after the guy next referred to the entire <br/>
sport of letterboxing as "a vicious unfriendly sport," Steve had the <br/>
graciousness to say he didn't mean to be rude or vicious.  It's all in how you read it, <br/>
I guess, but I thought that Steve ended up on the high road.  <br/>
<br/>
I've seen other near-flames extinguished by someone's willingness to step <br/>
back and apologize for a slight (real or imagined), or willingness to laugh off a <br/>
potentially-rude remark.  I always appreciate the person's restraint at such <br/>
times.<br/>

Actually, and I thank you for the compliments, WildWoman, I withdrew my<br/>
comments and refused to add fuel to the fire simply because I grow weary at<br/>
times from engaging in a battle of the wits with an unarmed person.  The<br/>
person in question did actually send me 6 emails, each of an increasingly,<br/>
uhm, shall we say, belligerent mood, yeah that's the ticket,  before I setup<br/>
a filter to bounce it back to him.<br/>
<br/>
Truth be known, I have a problem dealing with people that expect others to<br/>
give them something for nothing.  In my day, if you wanted something done,<br/>
you did it yourself or you searched as hard as you could to be sure you did<br/>
not end up looking the fool because you failed to see the nose on your face.<br/>
<br/>
So, to all, I apologize for my rude and abusively vicious comments made<br/>
about his ability or lack of ability to follow directions.  Perhaps I need<br/>
to remember by tag line......<br/>
<br/>
"I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter............"<br/>
<br/>
Which is, of course, not in any way directed at any current members of this<br/>
mailing list.  Just venting a little steam here on the beginning of the<br/>
weekend after 20 hours of coding and programming.  (grin)<br/>
