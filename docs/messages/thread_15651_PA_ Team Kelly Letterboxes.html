GEKO and myself were the proud "First Finders" on<br/>
Sunday as we stamped into the Three Team Kelly<br/>
Letterboxes hidden in two parks in Bucks County.<br/>
<br/>
The Two in Playwicki Park are supported by a solid set<br/>
of clues, and the boxes were found, safe and sound -<br/>
replaced where found.<br/>
<br/>
The backtracking implied by the clue list is not bad<br/>
at all, and we found no need to "back-engineer" the<br/>
clues for the second box. I would recommend tackling<br/>
the "Tunnel" one first, simply because that's the way<br/>
WE did them.<br/>
<br/>
The Core Creek Box is a longer walk through the<br/>
park... And got a little squirrely at the end. But the<br/>
box was found where promised, and replaced as the<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
The details can be found here:<br/>

If you were invited to join us ... And couldn't make<br/>
it because of the UltraShort notice provided, I<br/>
apologize. I'll try to get our letterbox plans out to<br/>
you all earlier in the week.<br/>
<br/>
If you didn't join us because you're just plain<br/>
lazy..... (phhhttt!) You missed a wonderful day's walk<br/>
through two of the nicer parks in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Highlights include:<br/>
<br/>
1) Core Creek was *heavily* populated in the picnic<br/>
area by at least TWO large Christian Gatherings,<br/>
enjoying the weather, and the *official* last day of<br/>
summer as far as school is concerned. During our walk<br/>
back from the box, I was approached by a gentleman<br/>
with one of the groups, as he searched for matches in<br/>
which to light a charcoal grill. As I searched my<br/>
pockets, I noticed his brow furrow as he read my<br/>
"AntiChrist Superstar" t-shirt. (I wore it in honor of<br/>
the Gothi Bats and Coffins Theme of the boxes, of<br/>
course) Biting off a snicker, I presented him with a<br/>
*spare* lighter I had - told him to "keep it", and<br/>
bade him a good day. We sauntered off over the hill<br/>
waving, to the sounds of a rather puzzled, "God<br/>
Bless!"<br/>
<br/>
2) What's up with all the spiders!? Do they sense the<br/>
approaching end of season? They seemed extraordinarily<br/>
aggressive around these particular boxes, so let the<br/>
Boxer Beware. *shiver*<br/>
<br/>
Until our next set - I remain,<br/>

Team PresSinOn was also in Bucks County yesterday. We were doing the <br/>
DE Canal boxes though, and met up with "The Leafcutters" at one <br/>
point. It must have been a big LBing day in Bucks yesterday. :)<br/>
We have some friends who want to give letterboxing a try. I was <br/>
looking at the boxes in Playwicki Park to try for with them, possibly <br/>
next Sunday. After reading your review, they sound like perfect boxes <br/>
to start them out on. <br/>
We've been to quite a few boxes in Bucks County, and we've never been <br/>
disappointed yet. The parks up there are beautiful. <br/>

Indeed they are - and what a day for it, eh?<br/>
<br/>
If recommending the Playwicki and Core Creek boxes to <br/>
newbies, remember to remind them to polish up on their <br/>
compass skills, as both sites make a fair amount of use to <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Also - Mention to them, that a PACE is a "relative" distance, and <br/>
some leeway should be granted when counting them out.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah! - Tell them to make sure they keep their eyes peeled for <br/>
those spiders.... (Yewwww .... Peeled Eyes - Spiders)<br/>
