&gt; Even though LBNA stands for Letterbox North America, the old clues<br/>
&gt; included:  Central America/Caribbean/Bermuda,<br/>
&gt; Canada/Greenland/Iceland<br/>
<br/>
All of these places are considered by some to be, at least partly,<br/>
in North America (a physical geographer will put half of Iceland there,<br/>
a cultural geographer will put the whole thing in Europe (Bermuda, tougher<br/>
case, but there is an argument), "central amercia/carribbean" is part of <br/>
North America as a _continent_ -- sorry, I'm a geography nerd and don't<br/>
oppose non-North American letterboxes being placed on LbNA, just wanted <br/>
to be a geography nerd :-) (ignore this paragraph)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Personally I think if a box is going to be placed in another country the <br/>
&gt; clues should also be available in the regional language.<br/>
<br/>
This begs the question -- is no clue better than a clue in a non-local<br/>
language? (for we as a group are not fluent in 6600 languages).  I would <br/>
argue to the contrary, and have written a couple of clues that are not <br/>
in the local language (which happened to be American English), and have <br/>
gotten good feedback about them.  But the philosophy of your point is <br/>
good, and is taken.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I also figure that it couldn't hurt to put some of the basic information<br/>
&gt; pages in Spanish (the faq and the getting started pages).<br/>
<br/>
If you (or anyone) translates the faq, it will be posted in that language <br/>
(assuming no objections, which I would not expect).  You may want to wait <br/>
'til I finish dusting it off (the revisions will be minor), but it will <br/>
always be the case that the translation is out of date as I modify the <br/>
English version only anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

lot of people but I feel pretty strongly about this. <br/>
I feel like the more I write about this the more I<br/>
come off like a self-righteous cranky jerk.  but I'm a<br/>
teacher so more than a few people think that about me<br/>
already so here goes.  <br/>
<br/>
<also different="" from="" people="" quotes=""><br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;I don't speak a lick of Polish and my<br/>
&gt;&gt;German, French and other foreign language skills<br/>
&gt;&gt;didn't help a bit in the translation.  Regardless,<br/>
we &gt;&gt;were still able to translate it and ultimately<br/>
found &gt;&gt;the letterbox last October.  <br/>
<br/>
I understand that the language is part of the clue. <br/>
But this is different as it was placed by someone from<br/>
the USA in the USA where there is already an<br/>
established group of people into letterboxing.  I know<br/>
there are translators and things, but I think it's<br/>
safe to say that letterboxing is relatively unknown in<br/>
the countries we are talking about so no one knows to<br/>
use the translator to find the clues for the<br/>
letterboxes that they don't know about.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also, if you check many of the personal foreign<br/>
&gt;&gt;letterboxing sites, (Germany, Netherlands, etc.)<br/>
their &gt;&gt;clues are written primarily in English and<br/>
then also &gt;&gt;translated into their native languages<br/>
when they opted &gt;&gt;to do so.  <br/>
<br/>
yes but these were boxes planted in Germany,<br/>
Netherlands, etc. by people from Germany, Netherlands<br/>
etc.  Also, multilingualism is far more common in<br/>
Europe than in this hemisphere.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;I would argue to the contrary, and have written a<br/>
&gt;&gt;couple of clues that are not in the local language<br/>
&gt;&gt;(which happened to be American English), and have <br/>
&gt;&gt; gotten good feedback about them.  <br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of clues here that have a trick to<br/>
them and I think that is great.  Language is<br/>
definitely an interesting one.  But I guess it all<br/>
boils down to a question of audience.  for the most<br/>
part the clues on the site are for boxes placed in<br/>
US/Canada for US/Canadian residents by US/Canadian<br/>
residents. In dealing with the other countries, the<br/>
same basic attitude is present.  <br/>
<br/>
There has been a lot of talk lately about asking<br/>
rangers about placing boxes, some people do this and<br/>
others do not.  The people that do this do so because<br/>
they don't want to generate any bad will between the<br/>
people who are essentially hosting the box.  The<br/>
people who don't do discuss this with the rangers can<br/>
at least take some solace in the fact that whether or<br/>
not the ranger knows about it, the box gets enough<br/>
traffic to "justify" it's environmental impact.  If it<br/>
falls out of repair the person who placed it usually<br/>
maintains it/removes it.  If we place boxes in<br/>
countries where there is no established letterboxing<br/>
population, where we can't maintain them, the won't<br/>
see as much traffic, and the local population can't<br/>
enjoy them, I don't think the environmental impact is<br/>
justifiable.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a term "the ugly american" (this has nothing<br/>
to do with the war or anything like that).  It refers<br/>
to the way that many US citizens act when traveling. <br/>
We have a reputation among international travelers as<br/>
people who take little regard for local customs,<br/>
language etc. and expect everything to be as easy for<br/>
them as it is in the states.  I'm sure many of us have<br/>
been abroad and head someone scream in an annoyed<br/>
voice "DOESN'T ANYONE HERE SPEAK ENGLISH!?"  Well,<br/>
maybe not.  that's part of international travel.  If<br/>
you can't deal with this, you should probably go to<br/>
Hawaii instead.  If we are going to place letterboxes<br/>
in other countries without being at least a little<br/>
flexible in how we go about it, we are basically<br/>
reinforcing the idea that we do not adapt to other<br/>
cultures.  I'm willing to be that letterboxers by<br/>
nature are not "ugly americans" when traveling and<br/>
this is not to say that it's not frustrating to not<br/>
speak the local language.  But this is a small way<br/>
that we can be a little more sensitive to the local<br/>
population when letterboxing in other countries.  <br/>
<br/>
Difficult clues or not, letterboxes are placed so that<br/>
they can be found.  If I go around placing boxes in<br/>
the most remote areas I can find with clues that are<br/>
over cryptic and no one finds them.  Instead of<br/>
letterboxing, I was basically just littering.  Trying<br/>
to encourage letterboxing in other countries reduces<br/>
the chance that we are just littering.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks if you made it this far.  If I seem<br/>
like a jerk, I'm really not so bad in person.  From<br/>
here I'm going to plan to e-mail translations for the<br/>
Central American and Mexican boxes to Wes over the<br/>
summer along with a translation of the getting started<br/>
and FAQ pages.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and for the record.  Can't translate for the boxes<br/>
in Zimbabwe or Kuwait (my opinions on the Kuwait box<br/>
are a little different just because I think the small<br/>
joy of  someone in the service finding a letterbox in<br/>
Kuwait when they have so many other things to deal<br/>
with far outweighs any environmental impact one<br/>
letterbox can cause, especially when you consider the<br/>
environmental impact of other things going on over<br/>
there).  Jen and I both can and will happily do any<br/>
translating for letterboxes placed in Spanish-speaking<br/>
or Portuguese speaking countries (working on French). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading, <br/>
Jim <br/>

      Take a look at Randy Hall's boxes. Some of his have been out in <br/>
the wilderness for years without being discovered! Now finding one of <br/>
them would be like finding hidden treasure! The beauty of the game is <br/>
diversity.<br/>
      Someday I may get to Zimbabwe and find that lonely L'box. If <br/>
only in my dreams!!!!!<br/>
