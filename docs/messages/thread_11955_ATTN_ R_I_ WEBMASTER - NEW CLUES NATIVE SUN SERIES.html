PLANTED BY: TODD N TAYLOR CARDEN ("TNT")<br/>
SERIES OF: (5) BOXES IN A 2.0 MILE LOOP<br/>
DIFFICULTY: LOTS OF COMPASS USE, SLIGHTLY STRENUOUS, GOOD FOR THE <br/>
WHOLE FAMILY.<br/>
<br/>
CAUTION DON'T FORGET TO WEAR YOUR BLAZE ORANGE FROM OCTOBER - <br/>
FEBRUARY AS THERE IS HUNTING IN THIS AREA.<br/>
<br/>
THIS SERIES IS A CELEBRATION OF THE "NATIVE AMERICAN" CULTURE, THEIR <br/>
RESPECT OF NATURE AND THERE WAYS OF SURVIVAL.<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS: TAKE EXIT 6 FROM 95 S AND BARE RIGHT ONTO RT. 3, TAKE <br/>
EXIT 6 FROM 95 N AND TAKE A LEFT ONTO RT. 3 ... ONCE ON RT. 3 GO TO <br/>
THE FIRST LIGHT OR 1.5 MILES, TAKE A LEFT HERE THIS IS HARKNEY HILL <br/>
ROAD. GO STRAIGHT FOR 1.1 MILES AND WATCH FOR BIG RIVER (ZEKES <br/>
BRIDGE) PARKING AREA AND BOAT LAUNCH ON YOUR RIGHT, YOU WILL PARK IN <br/>
THIS DIRT LOT.<br/>
<br/>
LETS GET STARTED, FROM THE LARGE SIGN IN THE LOT TAKE A BEARING OF <br/>
230deg. YOU SHOULD SEE A PATH ACROS THE STREET WITH SOME LARGE <br/>
BOULDERS AT ITS ENTRANCE. CROSS THE STREET AND HIT THE TRAIL. WALK <br/>
STRAIGHT ON THIS PATH WITH BIG RIVER ON YOUR RIGHT IN A FEW MINUTES <br/>
YOU SHOULD SEE AN OLD TRUCK FRAME ON YOUR LEFT. WALK TO THE FRAME AND <br/>
TAKE A READING OF 182deg. YOU SHOULD SEE AN OLD FOUNDATION, WALK <br/>
ABOUT 25 PACES TO IT. ONCE THERE TAKE A READING OF 120deg. AND LOOK <br/>
FOR 2 STONEWALLS, IN THE CLOSEST WALL ON THE LEFT SIDE YOU WILL FIND <br/>
THE "SUMMER VILLAGE" LETTERBOX. STAMP IN.<br/>
<br/>
NOW HEAD BACK TO THE TRUCK FRAME AND LOOK FOR A PATH AT 240deg. <br/>
HEADING THROUGH THE FIELD, FOLLOW THE PATH THROUGH THE FIELD FOR A <br/>
SHORT TIME BEFORE ENTERING THE FOREST. CONTINUE ON AND YOU WILL SOON <br/>
COME TO A CAMPSITE ON THE SHORE OF THE RIVER, CONTINUE ON THE PATH AT <br/>
146deg, VERY SOON YOU WILL REACH 3 TALL PINES IN A GROUP ON YOUR LEFT <br/>
WITH SEVERAL SMALL STUMPS ON YOUR RIGHT, (I BELIEVE I SAW A "TURTLE" <br/>
CRAWLING BEHIND THE 3 PINES)LOOK THERE TO FIND A POSSIBLE HIDING <br/>
SPOT. STAMP IN. HOPE YOU FOUND THAT SNEAKY LITTLE DUDE!<br/>
<br/>
CONTINUE ON AND YOU SHOULD SHORTLY PASS ANOTHER SHORELINE CAMPSITE ON <br/>
YOUR RIGHT, PASS THIS AND FOLLOW THE SHORELINE PATH UNTIL YOU COME TO <br/>
A STONEWALL AND A NICE PLACE TO SIT AND "WORSHIP" THE SURROUNDING <br/>
WETLAND. STAND ON TOP OF THE STUMP AT THE WALL AND TAKE A READING OF <br/>
100deg. FOLLOW THE WALL FOR 15 PACES AND LOOK LOW IN THE WALL FOR <br/>
THE "WORSHIP" LETTERBOX. STAMP IN.<br/>
<br/>
GO BACK TO THE STUMP AND TAKE A READING OF 130deg. AND FOLLOW THE <br/>
SOMEWHAT HIDDEN SHORELINE PATH A FEW YARDS UNTIL YOU REACH ANOTHER <br/>
CAMPSITE, HERE TAKE A READING OF 80deg. AND FOLLOW THE PATH THAT GOES <br/>
PARALLEL WITH THE STONEWALL ON YOUR LEFT TO A MAJOR PATH HEADING LEFT <br/>
AND RIGHT, GO RIGHT AND YOU WILL SOON PASS THROUGH A STONEWALL, <br/>
CONTINUE ON AND YOU WILL COME TO THE MUDHOLE CROSS OVER AND TAKE <br/>
THE "S" TURN LEFT, CONTINUE FOLLOWING THE SHORE AND SHORTLY YOU WILL <br/>
SWING LEFT THROUGHT THE PINES AND TO A SMALLER MUDHOLE. CROSS OVER <br/>
AND FOLLOW THE PATH AWAY FROM THE SHORE, CONTINUE ON AND TAKE A RIGHT <br/>
SIDE SHORELINE PATH THAT WILL SOON TAKE YOU TO 2 SHORELINE CAMPSITES, <br/>
AT THE FARTHEST SITE WITH THE BADLY BEATEN PINES. THIS LOOKS LIKE A <br/>
GOOD SPOT TO TAKE A FEW CASTS, THESE ARE "TROUT" WATERS, BY THE WAY. <br/>
IF YOU WANT TO CATCH A "TROUT" STAND AT THE FIRE PIT AND TAKE A <br/>
READING OF north AND WALK 27 PACES WHERE YOU SHOULD SEE 2 TALL <br/>
BROTHERS AT 260deg. LOOK BEHIND THE FIRST AND YOU MAY GET LUCKY. <br/>
STAMP IN. HOPE YOU CAUGHT A BEAUTY.<br/>
<br/>
NOW GO BACK TO THE FIRE PIT AND TAKE A READING OF 46deg, AND FOLLOW <br/>
THAT PATH AROUND THE STUMP ON THE RIGHT, CONTINUE ON TO THE RIGHT AT <br/>
156deg. THIS WILL LEAD YOU AWAY FROM THE RIVER OVER A COUPLE OF DIPS <br/>
IN THE PATH AND SOON START UP A SLIGHT INCLINE. SHORTLY YOU SHOULD <br/>
SEE AND HEAR RT. 95 UP AHEAD. THE PATH WILL THEN SOON SWING LEFT AND <br/>
FOLLOW UP A STEEPER INCLINE WHEN YOU REACH THE TOP WITH 95 TO YOUR <br/>
RIGHT GO 340deg. OR LEFT, CONTINUE ON WITH A STEEP INBANKMENT ON YOUR <br/>
LEFT. YOUR NOW ON YOUR WAY TO THE FINAL LB, THE "HUNTER" IS NOT FAR <br/>
OFF. IN A FEW MNINUTES YOU SHOULD PASS OVER A COUPLE OF FALLEN LOGS, <br/>
GO ON AND WALK UP A SMALL ROCKY RISE AND PASS THE BIG BOULDER ON YOUR <br/>
RIGHT, THEN PASS THE LARGE FALLEN TREE IN THE PATH TO YOUR RIGHT. <br/>
KEEP GOING AND PASS A COUPLE OF PATH SIDE BOULDERS, LARGE ON THE <br/>
RIGHT AND SMALL ON THE LEFT. FROM THE BOULDERS GO ABOUT 20 PACES <br/>
UNTIL YOU REACH A DEER PATH AT 260deg., FOLLOW THE DEER PATH 26 PACES <br/>
OVER A LOG. NOW AT 260deg. GO 15 PACES TO A LARGE BOULDER WHERE YOU <br/>
WILL FOLLOW A SLIGHTLY HARD TO SEE PATH DOWNHILL AT ROUGHLY 250deg. <br/>
UNTIL YOU REACH A STONEWALL, THIS LOOKS LIKE A GREAT PLACE FOR <br/>
A "HUNTER" TO SPOT SOME GAME. TO FIND THE "HUNTER" GO TO THE WELL <br/>
DEFINED BREAK IN THE WALL (do not go through the wall) TAKE A READING <br/>
OF 340deg. AND GO 6 PACES, LOOK LOW FOR THE ARROW IN THE STONEWALL (I <br/>
guess the "hunter" missed his first shot) AT THE ARROW LOOK FOR AN <br/>
OLD DEAD TREE AT 26deg.  AND 14 PACES, LOOK BEHIND THE DEAD TREE FOR <br/>
THE "HUNTER". STAMP IN.<br/>
<br/>
NOW TO YOUR CAR, HEAD BACK TO THE WALL, GO THROUGH AND FOLLOW THE <br/>
DOWNHILL PATH THAT FOLLOWS THE WALL AT 280deg. FOLLOW THE PATH AND <br/>
WALL UNTIL YOU REACH A HUGE PINE AND A WELL WORN PATH, HEAD NORTH <br/>
THROUGH THE WALL AND TRY NOT TO LOOK AT THE OLD DUMPSITE ON YOUR <br/>
LEFT, GO THROUGH THE TUNNEL OF PINES YOU MAY ENCOUNTER SOME WET SPOTS <br/>
AHEAD. CONTINUE ON, YOU WILL SOON BE PASSING THROUGH THE FIELD WHERE <br/>
YOU STARTED YOUR JOURNEY. KEEP ON STRAIGHT PAST THE FOUNDATIONS ON <br/>
YOUR LEFT AND RIGHT, THEN PAST THE TRUCK FRAME ON THE RIGHT. GO <br/>
STRAIGHT AND WITH IN 5 MINUTES YOU WILL BE AT THE PARKING AREA.......<br/>
