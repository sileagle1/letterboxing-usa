                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just stamped into the three boxes that were placed at the Storm <br/>
King Mountain Outdoor museum.  I was the first on one and the second <br/>
finder on the other two.  I believe that the museum closes in the <br/>
winter and I know that one of the boxes will expire when one of the <br/>
temporary exhibits ends.  I'd advise anyone who is interested in <br/>
checking out a really neat place not to wait.  You'll really enjoy it.<br/>
