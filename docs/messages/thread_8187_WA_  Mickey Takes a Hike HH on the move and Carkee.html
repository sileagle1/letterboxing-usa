at the barn to send "my" horse back home to his owners ( he didn't <br/>
work out :-(  ) in the PM I killed some time LB'ing in Seattle.<br/>
<br/>
Happy to report all the Carkeek Park LB's are doing well.  The <br/>
Fantasy boxes, Unicorn, Pixie Witch and Castle are fine, with the <br/>
witch the only one that might get challenged by wet weather.<br/>
<br/>
All the fish are fine and dandy.  I found "Mickey Takes a Hike" HH at <br/>
the King Salmon box.<br/>
<br/>
Transported him to a small city in the Puget Sound region.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough this HH was found by "Amanda from Seattle" in <br/>
Florida and she stamped it again last week in Seattle.  I get the <br/>
impression that she shared the HH with Ryan from Portland as they <br/>
were LB'ing together.<br/>
<br/>
The box I placed it in Amanda has already visited, so Mickey will not <br/>
score a triple hit this time.<br/>
<br/>
I scared some Geocachers with their find while looking for Salmon <br/>
Run.  I read the clues as saying to not climb the referenced stairs <br/>
but take the trail to the right.  By about the time I realized that <br/>
was the wrong choice I heard the Geocachers.<br/>
<br/>
I backtracked and when I found the LB the Geos were just on the other <br/>
side of the tree break.<br/>
<br/>
I had time to kill before the afternoon meeting so I visited a lone <br/>
box and Left Mickey cozy and dry squished into a box.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow I tackle some of the Oly boxes at last.<br/>

Actually, the story is that Amanda originally found the box in <br/>
Florida and brought it out west.  She dropped it off it Portland <br/>
where it started gravitating back home working its way down the <br/>
Columbia River Gorge and making it back as far as Idaho, where we <br/>
intercepted its travels and found it together.  Since Amanda had <br/>
already had the honor of moving the hitchhiker once (and cross-<br/>
country, no less!), I got the honors of deciding where to move it to <br/>
this time around.<br/>
<br/>
Mickey seemed to really be enjoying himself here in Seattle, and <br/>
especially that fish slide and "suspension bridge" at Carkeek Park, <br/>
so thus I dropped him off there.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The box I placed it in Amanda has already visited, so Mickey will <br/>
&gt; not score a triple hit this time.<br/>
<br/>
Have I already hit the box, because I'm still on the prowl hunting <br/>
down boxes in the Seattle/Tacoma area.  =)  And if Amanda's around <br/>
to tag along, it still has a chance of being a triple hit!<br/>
