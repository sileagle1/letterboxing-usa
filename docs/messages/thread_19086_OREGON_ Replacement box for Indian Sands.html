I placed a new box today and updated the clues.  I hope no one was disappointed not finding that box.  I live several hundred miles away from the area, so I can't check on it very often.  Hopefully my new hiding spot is better and it will live longer.  Come look for it now, while the wildflowers are so spectacular.  You must wander far from the box to see them, though.<br/>
Happy Trails,<br/>

PS  The new stamp is way way better than the original.  :)<br/>
