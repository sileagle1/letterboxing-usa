&gt; Location:		Barton Creek Greenbelt<br/>
&gt; Near:			Austin, TX<br/>
&gt; Placed on:		7/28/02<br/>
&gt; By:			The Pug Lovers<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Difficulty:  Kid and Dog friendly (weather permitting) but beware of<br/>
&gt; poison ivy and thorny bushes<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Directions:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *	Go to the Loop 360 access to Barton Creek Greenbelt<br/>
&gt; *	Park in the trailhead parking lot<br/>
&gt; *	Follow the winding path until you reach the path marked with a<br/>
&gt; "Caution" sign and make a right<br/>
&gt; *	At the next fork, take a left onto the path along the river (towards<br/>
&gt; Gaines)<br/>
&gt; *	Stay on the path to the right (closest path along the river)<br/>
&gt; *	Stop for a picture, a swim and a quick drink for your dog at the<br/>
&gt; scenic waterfalls on your right---there are 3 trees with 3 benches for you<br/>
&gt; to rest<br/>
&gt; *	Continue on the path underneath the highway overpass<br/>
&gt; *	From your next fork, continue on the hike/bike trail to the left of<br/>
&gt; the "Caution" sign<br/>
&gt; *	At the next fork, take the lower path marked by another "Caution"<br/>
&gt; sign<br/>
&gt; *	At 107 paces from this point, you will turn left on 180 degrees (To<br/>
&gt; make sure you are going the right way, at 45 paces you should pass a large<br/>
&gt; oak tree on the right of the path with a large hole in its bottom.), stop<br/>
&gt; and at a degree of 180 degrees take 15-20 paces.  (Watch out for the<br/>
&gt; triple-strand barbed wire about 6 paces off of the trail.)<br/>
&gt; *	You will see a large, distinct, V-split oak tree --- in a hole at<br/>
&gt; the base of the tree you will find the letterbox...<br/>

the "What's new" section but not in the Central Texas section.  Can this<br/>
please be added to the Central Texas clues section?  Thanks!<br/>
