found Silver Eagle's Mudbug box and had a report of the <br/>
condition of the box. I advised him to contact the placer. We <br/>
looked up the box and it wasn't there. Here's the work around: Go <br/>
to Search for boxes and then search by state. It will still let you <br/>
access the clues that aren't displayed on the site, for whatever <br/>
reason. Silver Eagle responded within minutes and all is well.<br/>

Hope this is beneficial to ya,<br/>

Silver <br/>

there? I <br/>

so, where <br/>
&gt; are they??<br/>
