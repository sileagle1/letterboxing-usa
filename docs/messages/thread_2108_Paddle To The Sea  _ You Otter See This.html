<div>Paddle To The Sea Letterbox  &amp; You 
Otter See This Letterbox </div>
<div>( Otter box is handicapped 
accessible)</div>
<div>Planted  3/25/01</div>
<div>Rated easy ; flat mostly paved on flood control 
dike</div>
<div> </div>
<div>North Windham, Ct   Windham 
County</div>
<div>More 
Cock-A-Doodle-Moo Boxes</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On rte 6 north Windham pass by Walmart and the 
shopping area as if going to Chaplin. Shortly after the shopping just past the 
end of Windham airports runway park at the communter parking lot.  Here you 
pass through the gate and see the dike run out in front of you in curving arcs 
headed to the Mansfield Hollow Dam flood control project.  This is an area 
abundent with  wildlife some permanent some passing through on their way to 
breeding grounds or winter  areas. We saw many variety of birds on our 
expedition here and were so lucky to watch a pair of river otters play  on 
the ice slip sliding on their bellies in sheer delight.  A pair of 
beautiful swans live here as well.  Walk on the paved dike do not go on the 
dangerous stone embankments! While walking you will pass  a pair of twin 
silver sentinals. 7 gaurds past these you will find the  " You Otter 
See This " letterbox. Because this  is a very busy walkpath try to 
camoflage your stamping activity with  birdwatching or some other thing. 
Rehide the box exactly in it's little house it is highly visible and will 
disappear if not done well.  The next box is not wheel chair handy but hope 
all you others will enjoy the rest of the walk. </div>
<div>    Continue down the dike. You 
reach a yellow gate just slip by and continue and you will  come to the end 
wall of the dam. The view is of the little village of Mansfield Hollow, the 
Kirby Mill, and of course the massive engineering feat of retaining the lake. 
Below to the left the river races away toward Norwich in boiling torrents over 
the  Horseshoe Falls. Water here moves treacherously fast at high 
water   please be careful while exploring this area. From this vantage 
point you can see where the box is hidden only you will hgave to back track a 
little to the yellow gate. Now bear right and down the path along the edge of 
the dike. It is paved but old. When it levels out look to the left for the 
tallest most well grown pine on the hill overlooking the river. Proceed to the 
big pine. At the Pine take a reading of 280 degrees. Site a stump and your  
Paddle to the Sea stamp awaits you there. </div>
<div>Paddle to the Sea is inspired by a childrens 
story of a handcarved canoe perched to ride the Canadian  snow melt out of 
the hills to Lake Superior and on to the sea. Paddle travels thousands of miles 
and at last is picked up on the great Fishing  banks in the North 
Atlantic.  Our paddle is perched thus on a snowy bank  where the 
melting snow quickly would send a little canoe to the sea, only our paddle 
wishes to remain and see you on your way.   Enjoy the park and  
your walk and these two handcarved stamps. </div></body></html>

How awesome!  I read this story to my kids just in the fall!  They loved it <br/>
and we launched our own ... "Paddle to the Mississippi" and "Float to the <br/>
Gulf of Mexico" with high hopes.  We had thought what a wonderful series of <br/>
boxes this book would make along the path "Paddle" had traveled in the book.  <br/>
We look forward to finding your Paddle if we ever make it there!<br/>
