i helped a fried of mine plant a letterbox my 3rd day into the chase, <br/>
and while i didnt think it was entirely appropriate for the place it <br/>
was laid to rest, i think it was cute and worth the walk. and it <br/>
still hasnt been posted. i shall bother her about it.<br/>
most of the stamps i have found have not been consistent with their <br/>
location, and one of the three that was, was damaged. i think the <br/>
underlying theme is that we are being tricked into some form of <br/>
ewxercise and that, i cannot in any way, argue with. anyways, i have <br/>
not been truly dissapointed in any of the stamps i have found and <br/>
actually have found 3 hitchhikers!<br/>
so if it's a great stamp and location, i give it a 100%.<br/>
if its a great stamp and poor location, i give it 75%.<br/>
if its a great location and poor stamp, i give it 75%.<br/>
if its anything else, i shall simply choose not to comment on it.<br/>
as thumpers daddy said, if you cant say anything nice...<br/>
your comments?<br/>

Spike,<br/>
Can you explain what you mean by "most stamps you've found not being <br/>
consistent with their location....?  Does your statement refer to <br/>
problems with the clues or choice of location considering theme of <br/>
stamp?  Just curious....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Some boxes have stamps that relate to the box's location, others have <br/>
random themes. If you can think of an image that fits the place--and <br/>
if you have the skills to carve something fancy--great!  If you just <br/>
want to carve a particular image and use that image in your next box, <br/>
wherever the box may go, that's fine, too.  Some of my stamps relate <br/>
specifically to their box locations, others don't.  One of my most <br/>
popular boxes--This Little Pig in Amherst, Mass.--has no relation <br/>
whatsoever to the hiding place, yet people seem especially drawn to <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Do whatever you feel like doing.  I have yet to be disappointed in any <br/>
handcarved stamp that I have found.  They are all great, whether <br/>
highly detailed or very simple.  I just love seeing the images that <br/>
people make.  <br/>
<br/>
I must admit I am a little disappointed when I find a box with a <br/>
storebought stamp.  Of course it's fun to do the hike and decipher the <br/>
clue, but I feel a little less excited about those boxes.<br/>
