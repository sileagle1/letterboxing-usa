received so many supportive and positive comments from <br/>
people. <br/>
<br/>
While reading other posts, I was very surprised at how negative <br/>
many people in this group can be. I have not planted many <br/>
boxes, but almost didn't do it at all because of the attitude I <br/>
sometimes feel here. I rarely even respond to posts for the same <br/>
reason.<br/>
<br/>
If I had seen the guidelines a couple of weeks ago, I would have <br/>
looked at the clues and never let any of you know I exist (until you <br/>
see my stamp). I thought the purpose of this group was to grow <br/>
this hobby, not turn people off.<br/>
