<br/>First of all, I haven't found very many hitchhikers that aren't in their own rubbermaid container.  Also, perhaps you've found so many hitchhikers because there are less letterboxes out in your neck of the woods to plant them.  Here in CT, I have found over 300 boxes, but a mere 13 hitchhikers, and some of those were shared with me by others between plantings.  If you don't want all of the hitchhikers in your neck of the woods, send them in the mail to me, and I will be glad to plant them here.  We have a new Hitchhiker Hostel, that I would love to visit again!

&gt; their own rubbermaid container.<br/>
<br/>
You know, that's kind of interesting because I've only just recently <br/>
found hitchhikers that are in their own container.  Of the 16 <br/>
hitchhikers I've found, the first 14 didn't have their own <br/>
container.  Only the last two have.  I was wondering where that trend <br/>
started from.... ;o)<br/>
<br/>
It's kind of ironic, actually, since the obvious reason for putting a <br/>
hitchhiker in its own container is so you don't have to worry about <br/>
it fitting into another letterbox, but some boxes are placed where <br/>
there's not enough room to put TWO boxes, limiting the places you can <br/>
hide it.  But then again, some boxes aren't big enough to hide a <br/>
hitchhiker inside but there's plenty of room to hide a second box <br/>
next to it.  Using both methods certainly increases the number of <br/>
letterboxes that you can hide hitchhikers with!<br/>
<br/>
But neither solution, I don't think, is going to allow something to <br/>
hide a hitchhiker in my Bookstore Box letterbox!  If someone figures <br/>
out a way to hide a hitchhiker with THAT, I'd love to check it out!  <br/>

<br/>
In absolute numbers, no, the one hitchhiker wouldn't be contributing <br/>
to the overpopulation of hitchhikers.  In relative terms, a full 50% <br/>
of your letterboxes are hitchhikers!  If everyone did that, you'd be <br/>
finding a hitchhiker in EVERY SINGLE letterbox in the country!  I <br/>
don't think anyone would argue against there being too many in that <br/>
case!  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Besides I didn't know one had to do anything with a HH if found.  <br/>
&gt; I thought the nice thing about letterboxing was that there weren't<br/>
&gt; a whole bunch or rules and regulations one had to follow in order<br/>
&gt; to enjoy the activity....guess I was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
You *don't* have to do anything with a HH if found.  And there aren't <br/>
really ANY rules or regulartions one has to follow except for perhaps <br/>
don't tear up the countryside looking for letterboxes and try to be <br/>
discreet.  Any "rule" or "regulation" beyond that is more of a <br/>
courtesy so others can enjoy the hobby to the maximum extent <br/>
possible.  If you move a HH, you don't HAVE to inform the owner, but <br/>
they'll appreciate it more if you do.  You could hide a hitchhiker <br/>
for every letterbox you place, but as a whole people would enjoy it <br/>
more if you hide more letterboxes than hitchhikers.<br/>
<br/>
None of those are hard and fast 'rules', but they make the game more <br/>
fun for others to play.  I don't think anyone wants to see the end of <br/>
hitchhikers--there's just a concern among some people that HHs are <br/>
becoming oversaturated (at least in some parts of the country).  <br/>
Finding a HH used to be a rare and exciting find, and for some <br/>
people, that's no longer the case.  Those people WANT to find <br/>
hitchhikers, but they still want them to be rare and uncommon finds!<br/>
<br/>
So hide your HH and don't worry about it so much.  =)  It's just <br/>
something worth considering before you start carving your next stamp--<br/>
would it really be better off as a hitchhiker?  Based on the ones <br/>
I've found, most hitchhikers would probably have been better off as <br/>
regular letterboxes.  (That includes mine, I might add, but the only <br/>
reason I hid most of my hitchhikers was because there used to be a <br/>
severe lack of them, not because I *wanted* them to be hitchhikers!)<br/>
