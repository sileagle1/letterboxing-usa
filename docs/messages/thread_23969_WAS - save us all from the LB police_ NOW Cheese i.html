                    <div class="plaintext-content">We're actually discussing "rules" in this thread, not cemetery behavior.<br/>
Cemetery behavior is the example I used because that was a major complaint<br/>
of a poster.  I would be the last person who would want to see someone allow<br/>
their dog to urinate or defecate on any cemetery monuments or stones.<br/>
However, yes I do take my dogs with me to visit cemeteries.  My parents'<br/>
graves and grandparents' graves included.  They loved animals and my animals<br/>
are very well behaved.  They've gotten too old to be anything other than<br/>
well behaved.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
The idea is that *if* a person considers that someone else bringing a dog<br/>
into a cemetery is "rude", then that person is also making an unwritten<br/>
"rule" in their mind about what how they expect others to behave in a<br/>
cemetery.  If someone finds that allowing children to climb on cemetery<br/>
monuments is "rude", then they're making an unwritten "rule" in their mind<br/>
that children should not be scampering all over monuments in cemeteries.<br/>
<br/>
It's absolutely no different with letterboxing.  If someone gets upset<br/>
because someone else didn't seal baggies before packing up the box and<br/>
rehiding it, then they're basically saying in their mind that, to that<br/>
person, sealing baggies is kind of a "rule" of letterboxing.  The same with<br/>
rehiding the box as good as or better than a person finds it.  If a person<br/>
truly doesn't consider that to be a "rule" in their mind, then why in the<br/>
world would they complain if it happened?  They wouldn't.  To the dismayed<br/>
person who finds a box out in the open, contents strewn all over the place,<br/>
it's become a "rule" in their mind that this shouldn't have<br/>
happened........at least not at the hands of humans.<br/>
<br/>
I'm simply pointing out that, whether we like to call it by the word "rule"<br/>
or not, there are etiquette principles that govern quite a bit of what we do<br/>
in life.  I think one of the most enlightening events is when I visit a<br/>
foreign country where the culture and etiqette expectations are so very<br/>
different than those of the U.S.  And my immediate reaction is to think<br/>
"Gosh, these people are sure rude!"  But they're not really.  It's just an<br/>
entirely different culture and an entirely different set of etiquette<br/>
principles.  But that's when I realize just how unconscious my<br/>
"expectations" can be.  It's like when someone like Emily Post sat down to<br/>
write out some "Rules of Etiquette."  She didn't exactly call the<br/>
"suggestions." :-)  She saw what she wrote down to be how the society at<br/>
that time expected folks to behave, and thus those were "rules" in her mind.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, it's just a game of semantics.  If someone is saying something<br/>
*we* don't like, then we see it as an attempt to "police" us.  If someone is<br/>
saying something we wholeheartedly agree with, then it's just "good common<br/>
sense etiquette that everyone else should know and abide by."  :-) But it<br/>
all comes down to exactly the same thing.  A rule by any other name.....<br/>

Ok..I'm going to chime in as well.  Cemetary's are for DEAD people.  I know<br/>
that sounds reall harsh to most..but the people are DEAD and they really<br/>
don't care.  This is not to be meant as disrespectful either. I lost both of<br/>
my parents and they are both buried in cemetary's that are unique and that<br/>
*deserve* to be visited.  How else are people going to remember the past if<br/>

other domestic animal deficates in a cemetary or any other public area, I<br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">My degree is in anthropology so I have to say -- I do think there are unwritten "rules". It's <br/>
called culture. There are many scientists who spend their lives studying and discussing <br/>
and identifying these "rules" [including me] so I don't think it's just all in my head. <br/>
<br/>
Culture in general has base paradigms which are accepted as such -- and also sometimes <br/>
are broken, sometimes deliberately [as in "rebellion"] and sometimes through ignorance. <br/>
The same is true for subcultures -- like among letterboxers. I have not seen, for example, <br/>
anyone disagreeing thus far that items in a box should be sealed up and rehidden in the <br/>
exact same spot. Of course no one forces anyone to do so, but that is one example of a <br/>
generally accepted "rule" that is a "rule" and if it is broken, the offending party would be <br/>
the object of group censure.<br/>
<br/>
There are also unwritten rules in every culture and everyone knows them -- especially <br/>
when you break them. Then there are those who actually write down "rules" and share <br/>
them with the voice of authority. It is interesting to me, the issue of who has "authority" to <br/>
decide and how the decision is made to grant such an authority. For example, your own <br/>
post on the subject of "speed boxing" said you felt "alarmed" and that you had some <br/>
concenrns, and what they were. You spoke with the voice of experience, but not the tone <br/>
of "authority", and were careful to include that you were discussing your own preferences. <br/>
You offered good information and much to think about, while making it clear you were <br/>
talking about yourself and your own preferences.<br/>
<br/>
This issue came up on the newboxers list in another format. What is a "newboxer"? What <br/>
marks a "newboxer"? And when is one no longer a "newboxer"? When does a letterboxer <br/>
gain any kind of "authority" within the subculture?<br/>
<br/>
So if anyone would like to decide "no one is allowed to have unwritten rules" I would just <br/>
have to say, gee thanks for completely dismissing my hoity toity $80,000 education, there. <br/>
:-) Everyone can break "unwritten rules". People can walk down the street picking their <br/>
noses so intently it looks like they are splunking. Most Americans would find that behavior <br/>
crass and would be uncomfortable with witnessing it. Anothe rexample is to go to a <br/>
packed sporting arena or anywhere else with lots of strangers, and go in to use the <br/>
opposite sex bathroom. There's a reason why some classic films show that as a "funny" <br/>
scenario. Breaking the rules.<br/>
<br/>
For me -- I want to make it as clear as possible -- I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH <br/>
DISCUSSING RULES, written or unwritten. I like to know what "the rules" are so I can decide <br/>
for myself if I must follow them or not, based on my own judgement and situation. Rules <br/>
ar egreat. I am interested in the information and in everyopne's preferences, and in why <br/>
they feel that way, why it's a good idea, why not a good idea. Bring it on.<br/>
<br/>
My own post was not about having rules, bc there are always rules. It was in regards to, <br/>
who speaks with the tone of authority and to whom is it appropriate to speak so? Who can <br/>
cross the line from saying "This is not my preference" or "I have concerns about this, and <br/>
this is what they are" and thus make a case for their persepctive to "You are bad." For <br/>
example, do I have the authority to walk up to someone with their dog in a cemetary and <br/>
tell them they are "wrong"? In general no. That would be highly presumptuous of me. On <br/>
the other hand, my 46 yr old stepmother just died of breast cancer, her grave is fresh, and <br/>
her headstone cost several thousand dollars. If I am at her grave and I see someone bring <br/>
their dog near it, you bet I will say something, bc having it be a family grave gives me the <br/>
right, or the authority. [and if that person says to me, "she's dead, she doesn't care, what's <br/>
your problem" then there will truly BE a problem]<br/>
<br/>
In other situations, I think it is a question of tone and intent. I've already been told once on <br/>
this list I am not a real letterboxer and the letterboxes I find and that I prefer to find, are <br/>
not "real boxes." Not, "I don't prefer those sorts of letterboxes" and "they don't interest" <br/>
me," but in general, "these are not real letterboxes" and "who knows what I am doing to go <br/>
find them but it's not real letterboxing."<br/>
<br/>
Now if I found that insulting, with my paltry 2 dozen finds, I can just imagine this poor <br/>
woman who had over 12,000 finds being a little bent of of shape if people start telling her <br/>
she is not a real letterboxer bc she found them too fast. You can share your own opinions, <br/>
ideas and preferences without deliberatly insulting people. You can say "this concerns me <br/>
for the hobby as a whole" without putting yourself on some pedestal. At least, that is what <br/>
*I* think.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for an interesting discussion. My time online is almost up and I have a conference <br/>
next week -- so happy Thanksgiving everyone!<br/>
