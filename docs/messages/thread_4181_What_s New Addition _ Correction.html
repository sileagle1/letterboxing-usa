 Hello All:<br/>
<br/>
 I placed the LBNA stamp into the "Quaker Yarn" box at Rinker's rock in <br/>
Philadelphia on 3/17/2001 (St. Patty's Day)<br/>
<br/>
 SpaceTraveler <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  See Joy and Floating Feather picked this up 6-21-01 at "A Quaker Yarn" in <br/>
  the Wissahickon Park in Philadelpha, PA., must have forgotten to date the <br/>
  logbook....opps!!!....it stopped by "Body Parts" in the same park and then <br/>
  visited the Valley Forge #2 letterbox on the same date.<br/>
  Placed in the "Merrill Creek" location 7-1-01.<br/>
  I believe Todd And Pam carried it on from there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 The LbNA hitch hiker just got a ride on a big jet. It has been lounging <br/>
 in the coolest hiding place ever in Davis, CA for the last three months <br/>
 until I gave it a lift. Poor thing, it had to leave sunny California <br/>
 for the rainy climes of the Pacific Northwest. Who was that last <br/>
 letterboxer who dropped it off? There was no note on the page... red <br/>
 howling coyote, who are you? Funhog<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 The LBNA hitch hiker was found by the Catbird and myself in the Spirit of <br/>
Dartmoor letterbox on 12/27. What a great box, Mad Stamper! We really enjoyed <br/>
both the clues and the location -- it was a pleasant way to top off a full <br/>
day of Portland boxing.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, LBNA kept us company for a while, telling us all about his trip across <br/>
the country, but he still had itchy feet. He mumbled something about helping <br/>
out the park service (?) and disappeared.<br/>
