tonight.  Since tomorrow is the last day and we don't expect to go <br/>
tomorrow I didn't want to leave it.  <br/>
<br/>
I am really glad to see from the log that it was a success and people <br/>
enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
Hey Psychomommy, you were there today same as us.  Too bad we didn't <br/>
see you.<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering if anyone had to wait until other people left to get <br/>
the box.<br/>

We will always treasure the prize you left! What a cool idea! <br/>
<br/>
Please do it again next year - it really was the major high-point of <br/>
our day.<br/>
<br/>
There was a guy snoozing on the bench next to us - but I don't think <br/>
he noticed.<br/>
<br/>
Is it just me, or were the bees out of control this year? Perhaps we <br/>
went too early in the season.<br/>

I am about to head to the Faire today. One more day to wench it up! <br/>
<br/>
But when I was there I had to come back 2 times. First time there was <br/>
a mom and babe sitting there, and seemed pretty set. The second was a <br/>
young couple 'makin out' for it seemed like forever. But I eventually <br/>
got it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the special finders prize. That made the wait all that <br/>
more rewarding. Thanks Scarab!<br/>
