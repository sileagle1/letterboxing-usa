                    <html><body>We just found Christmas Tree Graveyards and Furry Woodland Creature -- both safe and sound!  If you plan to do Christmas Tree Graveyards, please note that there is a detour for part of the trail.  If you stick to the detour, you will eventually come to a landmark that will put you back on track.
<br/>
<br/>We've also found Remnants of the Past in MD, and Ellanor C. Lawrence Park #2 and Two Birders in Lawrence Park (VA) this week.  Ellanor C. Lawrence Park #1 hasn't been found in about a month, according to notes left at #2.
<br/>
<br/>Note to Firefly:  we keep our clues in a binder, organized by states in the area.  Punching holes and organizing clues keeps us busy during these long winter nights.  Happy New Year to all!  D and Shoo</body></html>
