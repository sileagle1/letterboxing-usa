                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is just a reminder of the fast approaching CT Gathering on Saturday May <br/>
17, in Middlebury CT. The park is an easy drive off exit 17 from I- 84. Hop <br/>
Brook Lake you can get directions off the website.<br/>
There is a 4.00 per car fee to enter the park so car pool and split the <br/>
cost.<br/>
We have rented the "Meadows Pavillion"  there are grills if you want to <br/>
bring anything to barbeque. In addition to a food item to share please bring <br/>
a bottle of something to drink. We will be providing plates, cups, napkins <br/>
and garbage bags.<br/>
There is going to be a hitchhiker exchange. If you have carved a HH or <br/>
recently found one you can put it in the basket and take another one home in <br/>
exchange to place. Or if you have carved lots of stamps over the long, cold <br/>
winter bring a few because I'm sure there will be folks who dont bring one <br/>
but would like to take one to place.<br/>
<br/>
We are also going to have a scavanger hunt/raffle type thing but we are <br/>
still working out the details. Just trust us it will be loads of fun!!!<br/>
There are 3 sets of clues for boxes in the park. Presidential series #1 and <br/>
2. Aarons Birthday Box and a mystery box. Don't forget to bring copies of <br/>
the clues with you.  You will have to find Rubaduc to get the clues to the <br/>
mystery box.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to plant a box for the event please do the more the merrier. If <br/>
you have a great idea to enhance the event please do it.<br/>
Donna and Chuck are driving up from far away with the  stamp to commemorate <br/>
Gerbil anon......without whom none of this would be possible.<br/>
I have spent a good deal of time at this park and they have never made an <br/>
issue out of dogs in the water, except on the beach.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all can make it....Rubaduc claims this will the social event of <br/>
the season.<br/>
