Impostor." It can be found in the Columbia River Gorge using the<br/>
following rhyme:<br/>
<br/>
The Impostor<br/>
<br/>
When on the trek for larger game<br/>
The clues to me are just the same<br/>
<br/>
Keep on the trail and you will find<br/>
The one you truly have in mind<br/>
<br/>
The trophy here is cute and meek<br/>
But the one ahead is what you seek<br/>

Its nice to write a clue for a change ...<br/>
<br/>
Lost in a Small Town: http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box45.html<br/>
<br/>
As is typical, its long, hard, and not for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
There is no reward for being first, but there is a fabulous prize for <br/>
being the last to stamp in.  Just e-mail me if this applies to you.<br/>
(I guess this means that if two or more of you are simultaneously rushing<br/>
past each other to stamp in, that you should defer to the other, in order<br/>
to get the fabulous prize.  This should promote a more genteel, old world<br/>
flavor of 'boxing, which I guess would be a Good Thing).<br/>

Cheers<br/>
