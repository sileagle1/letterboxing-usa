This is a microbox so please bring a stamp pad and pencil.  Go to the <br/>
Ridgewood Cemetery in Wellston, Ohio.  To get to the cemetery, turn <br/>
onto East A Street (up the hill) from State Route #93 (Pennsylvania <br/>
Ave.)  The cemetery is at the top of the hill.  You need to find a <br/>
large cannon (16,155 lbs!) placed by the James Smith Post of the <br/>
GAR.  From the breech end of the gun, take a bearing of 276 and go <br/>
about 16 paces (1 pace = 2 steps) to the corner of a low, crumbling <br/>
stone wall.  Walk along the wall for about 4 paces or so and look <br/>
over it.  You should see a couple of pieces of stone lying against <br/>
the wall and you should find the Ridgewood Flower awaiting you under <br/>
them.  As always, be cautious of snakes and critters that tend to <br/>
love old walls like this.<br/>
