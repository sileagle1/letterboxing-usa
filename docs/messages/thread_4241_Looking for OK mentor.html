<div>Welcome!</div>
<div>It means that you have put 65Â different stamps out in the 
world for people to discover and delight in. Please note - you do not have to 
carve your stamps. It is perfectly acceptable to purchase the stamps you place 
in the boxes. A big part of the fun is discovering the new bit of artwork when 
you open the box. Some folks take great pleasure in carving their own stamps, 
but for others its a chore, or for some reason they may think that their stamps 
aren't "good enough". For myself, learning to carve my own stamps was an 
unexpected bonus to this pastime. </div>

&gt; are identical or all different?<br/>
<br/>
Well, they COULD all be the same, but then there would be very little <br/>
incentive for someone to find your box.  Part of the joy in <br/>
letterboxing is finding a new and unique stamp in every box.  If the <br/>
stamp image can somehow reflect the location it's hidden in, that's <br/>
even better!  When you start finding lots of boxes, you can get an <br/>
idea of the types of stuff other people are hiding.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Please note - you do not have to carve your stamps. It is perfectly<br/>
&gt; acceptable to purchase the stamps you place in the boxes.<br/>
<br/>
As a hunter of boxes, I'd just like to say that I much prefer an <br/>
ugly, hand-carved stamp that shows absolutely no artistic talent than <br/>
a beautiful, store-bought stamp.  When the stamp is hand-carved, no <br/>
matter how ugly you might think it is, it just has more "character" <br/>
to it that I love.  =)<br/>
<br/>
One of the ugliest series of stamps I've seen--I won't name names to <br/>
protect the guilty--happens to also be one of my most favorite <br/>
series.  The stamps are truly awful.  Looks like a two-year old <br/>
carved them.  (It wasn't a two-year old who carved them, though!)  <br/>
But I love them.  They've got so much character!  =)  And the stamps <br/>
were carved specifically with that location in mind, which part of <br/>
what gives them their charm.  <br/>
<br/>
What's the point of my saying all that?  Two points:<br/>
<br/>
1. Don't be afraid of hiding a stamp you've carved just because you <br/>
don't think it's any good.  It may seem strange, but people may very <br/>
well love the stamps anyhow!  I've carved more than one stamp I <br/>
thought were hidious that others seem to love for God knows what <br/>
reason.  *rolling eyes*  People really do seem to enjoy even the <br/>
worst hand-carved stamps over store-bought ones.  Of the 99 boxes <br/>
I've found, there's only two stamps I really didn't like.  One was a <br/>
store bought stamp.  The ONLY one I've found that was store bought, I <br/>
might add.<br/>
<br/>
2. And, from personal experience, the more you carve, the better <br/>
you'll get!  The difference between my first stamps and those that I <br/>
carve today are like night and day.  There's a learning curve to <br/>
stamp carving, and if you'll never improve if you keep going out to <br/>
buy stamps for letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
So while you can buy stamps at stores to hide in boxes, please <br/>
reconsider!  I guess I can't speak for everybody, but I'd much rather <br/>
see ugly, hand-carved stamps instead!  =)  (Beautiful, hand-carved <br/>
stamps are welcome too, of course.)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with Riskynil on several points.  I definitely prefer a hand carved <br/>
stamp to a store bought one.  I have only planted 3 boxes and I was very <br/>
worried that my carving was not up to snuff.  But my family loved them and I <br/>
hope that you do too.  I found great success using a speedball linoleum <br/>
cutter with a #1 or #2 gouge (about $6).  I've been practicing and even <br/>
though I don't think I'm particularly artistic it is lots of fun anyway.  The <br/>
favorite stamp I've collected so far is the A-Maizing (sic) Conifer part of <br/>
the RIBNAG family of friends series.  Thanks for all those beautiful stamps <br/>
everyone.<br/>
