<div>Planted 9/13/01  by Leader of the Pack</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For: Den 4 of Pack 65  Coventry  and all  
others who come </div>
<div> </div>
<div>At the junction of Rte 44 and North River Road  park near 
the red barn which was at one time a plant research farm, for the University of 
Connecticut.  The greenhouse is gone and the building will become the Ct. 
Glass Muesam.  Diagonally across the street the glass blowers house still 
stands.  Here is the location of the Coventry Glass works. A historic 
location and any antique dealer will tell you  of very valuable green glass 
bottles blown by hand on the end of a pipe many years ago. A deep indent in the 
bottom of the bottle marked where the pipe had been attached during the blowing 
stage this part is called the pontal. Coventry glass was a deep green. 
Local  residents still may uncover bits of " slag" or waste glass 
when digging in their yards.  When the Muesam opens come to learn more 
about Coventry Glass. </div>
<div>    To find the Coventry Glass Letterbox  
leave your car and walk toward the river on the mowed access area. ( This is 
public access to the river ,a popular fishing spot ).just before the river note 
a large grapevine entwined in the trees on the left. Also to the left you can 
see into a small clearing beyond the weedy edge of the tree line. Pass through 
the weeds before the grapevine and into the clearing. Here in the clearing  
find the tree with  4 trunks coming from the base. Behind this tree covered 
with river rock is  your letterbox. Please stamp privately and rehide the 
box as you found it.  Be sure the cover is tight and the rock on top to 
keep the weather out.  Congratulations on your find. Have Fun and Be Safe.
