<div>JAMES SCHOOLHOUSE LETTERBOX</div>
<div>PRESQU'ISLE,  MAINE</div>
<div>AROOSTOOK COUNTY</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Planted by the Bonnie and Clyde Gang of CT on August 20th, 
2002.  Easy.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Follow Rt 1 South out of the center of Presqu'isle.  
Follow the signs to Aroostook State Park off of Rt 1, but continue straight when 
the signs to the park indicate that you turn left.  You will 
see the Launch Site of the First TransAtlantic Balloon Flight.  You 
may want to stop here for an interesting visit.  (We were going to 
plant a box here, but couldn't find a spot to hide it.)  The James 
Schoolhouse is further down the road, about a mile on the left.  (It is 
yellow.)Turn in here.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This one room schoolhouse was built in 1917. Peek in the 
windows and you'll see the school just as it might have been when children 
filled those seats reading from their books,  the stove in the middle 
glowing with warmth, the teacher pacing up and down the rows, and one or two 
students day-dreaming out the long row of windows.  Just imagine if those 
walls could talk, what stories they'd tell.  The restoration of this old 
school is marvelous and has been filled with furniture and items of the 
era.  The hours for July and August are between 1-2.  Perhaps, 
you'll be lucky enough to be able to go inside if you go on a Saturday 
afternoon.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>To find the letterbox, go left out back to the shed where 
they would have kept wood.  Go around the shed.  Now you are behind 
the school. Near one of the posts of the shed's foundation, look for a flat 
rock.  What you seek is under there.  Rehide carefully.</div>
