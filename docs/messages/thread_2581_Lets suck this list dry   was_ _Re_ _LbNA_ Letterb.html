Eric now asks on this list for Letterboxing articles and sites and then adds<br/>
he is to be contacted off list. Sure don't want them to share them here,<br/>
right Eric? It would be silly to post Letterboxing articles and sites on<br/>
here, right?<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm. You use this list to get information to place on your site and ask<br/>
others not to be OPEN and share but to send it to you off list. Maybe I am<br/>
missing something here. Can we all use THIS list to promote our new sites<br/>
and encourage people not to share any information with this group but to<br/>
send it off list?<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Letterboxing articles and sites<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have been trying to update my list of letterboxing related links on<br/>
&gt; the Letterboxing International site. I have found several new<br/>
&gt; articles and sites over the last few days, and some visitors to the<br/>
&gt; site have also been kind enough to suggest some that I have missed<br/>
&gt; thus far. If anyone knows of some letterboxing articles online or<br/>
&gt; letterboxing related information sites (apart from just individual<br/>
&gt; clue lists) you would like to suggest, please contact me off list.<br/>
&gt; Thanks much, and hopefully some of the links may be of interest to<br/>
&gt; others.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I believe I am the one who prompted the email from Eric.  I do not know Eric<br/>
Mings and I do not want to know all the old baggage that goes with this talk<br/>
list.  I have recently started letterboxing and thoroughly enjoy the<br/>
Letterboxing.org site.  I also was interested when I read about Eric's new<br/>
site.  I am trying to get as much info about the "sport" as possible so I<br/>
pulled up his site.  I noticed he linked to magazine articles about<br/>
letterboxing, so I sent him a new link which started me in letterboxing.  I<br/>
have not noticed such a convenience at the .org site so I did not send the<br/>
link there.  However, if I am mistaken, here is the site address:<br/>
http://www.rotary.org/newsandinfo/rotarian/2000/0012/index.shtml.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, I do not know what has gone on in the past (and I don't care),<br/>
but I do know your emails to Eric are seething with  hatred.  Those of us<br/>
interested only in the sport appear to have grown weary of this.  I'm sure<br/>
in the wide web there is room for two sites - each with a little different<br/>
slant.  Each will be enjoyed and shared by all who truly enjoy the game.<br/>
When the web is searched for "sex", almost 992,000 sites are available - and<br/>
it hasn't spoiled the fun for those who play that game...<br/>
