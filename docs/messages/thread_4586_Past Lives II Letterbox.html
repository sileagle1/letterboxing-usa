                    <html><body><b>Past Lives II
<br/></b>Cincinnati, OH  Hamilton County
<br/>Stanbery Park   Mt. Washington
<br/>Placed: Feb. 28, 2002 by Team Boji (www.ZAX31@AOL)
<br/>
<br/>Driving directions:  In Mt. Washington, at the intersection of Beechmont Ave. and Corbly St., turn west on Corbly.  Go one block and turn right on Oxford Ave.  Go one block and turn left into the Stanbery Park parking lot.
<br/>
<br/>Clues:  At the west end of the parking lot look at the Events Board and check out the park map.  Notice the trail to the right and how it loops around to the picnic shelter.  Take a heading of approx. 290 degrees along a roadway past the bronze statue of a young boy reading a book about tailoring.  A little farther along you have the uncanny recollection of having been a downhill skier in a past life.  Well, off you go downhill!  Get into a good tuck and pick up speed so you can glide along the path at the bottom of the hill.  You fly across two small bridges, jump a fallen tree and coast to a stop at a wooden bridge with handrails.  At the far end of the bridge and ten paces to the left, you may see a tree that has fallen toward the north.  Close to the roots you may find <b>Past Lives II.</b></body></html>
