boxing at Rocky Neck State Park today.  We managed to bag the whole <br/>
series except the last 2- we got those at the CT Kid's day.  They <br/>
were terrific.  We forgot our clues for Resolution and Winter Camping <br/>
Is For The Birds :-(  Oh, well.  It just gives us another excuse to <br/>
go back to a great park.  Thank you to Butterfly, Bluebird, Lobsta, <br/>
and Camel for putting out this new series!<br/>
