                    <div class="plaintext-content">Agreed. No one should go broke shopping for little extras. While I do <br/>
like having many colored stamps in my logbook, I truly appreciate the <br/>
added personal story or bit of local lore included in some boxes, and <br/>
that's free and un-messy.<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple paper towels stuffed in with my LB stuff, and I'll <br/>
squirt a little water on a stamp and pat it off with a paper towel <br/>
before returning it to it's hiding place.  Besides, they're also <br/>
handy when you LB with a four-year old who takes the opportunity to <br/>
stamp everything in sight with her stamp when you're busy looking at <br/>
the box's logbook....like rocks, leaves, the toe of Daddy's boot....<br/>

&gt; While it was nice to find different color inkpads in some of the <br/>
&gt; boxes in CT, most other boxes I've found have not included them.  I <br/>
&gt; think we should keep it simple: clues, box, stamp and logbook.  <br/>
That <br/>
&gt; should be the minimum requirements.  Anything bwyond that is noce, <br/>
&gt; but not required.  There are some climates where inkpads would dry <br/>
up <br/>
&gt; pretty fast, and I've seen some pretty messy logbooks that were <br/>
&gt; stached with inkpads.  Let's keep in simple, and if people want to <br/>
&gt; include more, fine.  that's even better.  I just don't want anyone <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; get the impression that they should be including inkpads too.<br/>
