<br/>
One of my other hobbies is Vintage Dancing.  <br/>
(http://vintagedancers.org/)  I was just at an 1860's ball last night <br/>
and was talking about letterboxing and how it started.  Many of <br/>
my vinatge dance friends are facinated with victorian activities.<br/>
<br/>
I spend a week in the summer  with my friends doing vintage <br/>
dancing in period clothing, having tea, having dance classes, <br/>
and dancing in historic settings.  Some people are new to the <br/>
dance week campus and letterboxing might be a good way to get <br/>
people to take a campus stroll . They thought it might be fun to try <br/>
letterboxing - but not the way we do it now - the way they did it <br/>
when it was created.  Does anyone know how it was done?  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">the LITM Association has both English Country &amp; Contra dances.  We are <br/>
holding a Jambory Nov 19th where we will be having workshops in both dancing  &amp; <br/>
music.  I have done some English Country dancing where we have a tea table during <br/>
our break.  Last year they held a Jane Austin dance where we all came in <br/>
costum from the charatures in her novels.  It was great fun. <br/>
They are showing Pride &amp; Prejudice. in the local art cinama &amp; we will have a <br/>
dance there after the movie.  I think the movie is a new verison &amp; will be <br/>
playing in other places as well.<br/>
<br/>
I too do letterboxing but we don't have too many boxes here on Long Island, <br/>
New York.<br/>
