SERIES #1<br/>
<br/>
Planted by Bluebird (with Butterfly's help) on a rainy Saturday, <br/>
April 26, 2003.<br/>
<br/>
Boxes 4+4=8; easy to medium walking difficulty; 4 trails of 15-60 <br/>
minutes each.<br/>
<br/>
This year I was appointed trails chairman for our beautiful KLCT <br/>
properties. I want to encourage others to get out and enjoy them, <br/>
so here is the first series and more will follow as we fix up and <br/>
add to our trails system.<br/>
<br/>
NINEVEH FALLS LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
Park on Route 80, on the Madison side of the bridge over the <br/>
Hammonasset River. The pull-out is on the north side of the <br/>
road, very near the bridge. You will know you are on the bridge <br/>
when you see the Lake Hammonasset dam on the north side of <br/>
the road. Also, the river is the dividing line between the two <br/>
towns.<br/>
<br/>
As you head back toward the bridge you will see stairs down <br/>
toward the river. Take them! Enjoy the wonderful view of the dam <br/>
to your left, with Nineveh Falls splashing below. Another day <br/>
borrow the Regional Water Company pass from the library, or <br/>
join, and hike the water company trails plus find the boxes they <br/>
have hidden there! Cross over the river and head toward your <br/>
right. You will be on water company land for a short distance, but <br/>
the KLCT has an easement. Notice the beauty of the bridge <br/>
structure, which you could never see from above. Soon you will <br/>
be on our KLCT property. Continue on the trail with orange-red <br/>
blazes. Pass the old tanning factory (can you believe that they <br/>
used to dump the leftover chemicals into our river?!). Walk (&lt; 10 <br/>
minutes) until the trail begins to veer away from the river. You will <br/>
note some large, mossy, rocks on your right  larger than any <br/>
others, so far. Walk to the far end, around, down and look under <br/>
the ledge for the Nineveh Falls Letterbox. Be sure to read <br/>
carefully so you can find the bonus on your way back! This lovely <br/>
trail (which continues south quite a way and will eventually <br/>
connect to the trail along Bar Gate Trail where you can find two <br/>
letterboxes!) was an Eagle Scout project and has a great <br/>
swimming hole further down.<br/>
<br/>
DOES IT BELONG? LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
Cross back over in Killingworth, headed east on Route 80. Pass <br/>
by Chatfield Trail and Chatfield Hollow where you can find other <br/>
hidden letterboxes. 2.8 miles up, on your left, just past the circle <br/>
and the Killingworth Cafe, you will see a large white building. <br/>
Drive past it, turn around and park in the pull-off on the north side <br/>
of the road. Find the trail entrance to the Winkle Pond trail by the <br/>
mapboard. <br/>
<br/>
Take the trail, left, clockwise, around the pond. When you come <br/>
to a 5-sister tree in the first wall, look behind it to find the Does It <br/>
Belong? letterbox nestled in the rocks. Well  does it belong? Be <br/>
sure to read the logbook carefully so you will not miss the bonus. <br/>
Also keep an eye out for the cave and be prepared to cross <br/>
some minor streams and wetland areas. I hope you enjoyed this <br/>
half-mile loop which was an Eagle Scout project.<br/>
<br/>
KILLINGWORTH LAND CONSERVATION TRUST LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
This next one is located at our KLCT nature center on Roast <br/>
Meat Hill Road. Turn your car around, again headed east on <br/>
Route 80. Eight-tenths of a mile up, take a left onto Roast Meat <br/>
Hill Road. Drive another nine-tenths of a mile to the Platt Nature <br/>
Center on your left. Park out front in the designated area. Many <br/>
wonderful nature classes are taught here! This building is our <br/>
KLCT "headquarters."<br/>
<br/>
At the trail map mailbox (take one, if available), go left for a <br/>
clockwise loop. At the third cedar, head left on the trail, into the <br/>
woods. The trail is unblazed at present, so watch carefully for the <br/>
beaten path. When you see a ledge on your right, the trail heads <br/>
left a little. Soon you will spot a large glacial erratic on your left  <br/>
look to the right. See the "snake tree?" Find the KLCT Letterbox <br/>
under a projection of rock to its right. Be sure to read carefully so <br/>
you will not miss the bonus. Continue on the trail and do not <br/>
miss the short-but-interesting boardwalk which you will soon <br/>
come to. <br/>
<br/>
KILLINGWORTH LAND CONSERVATION TRUST TRAILS <br/>
LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox contains our new trails logo! To find it, head back <br/>
south on Roast Meat Hill. Take your first right, onto Wolf Hollow <br/>
Road a very short way ahead. Follow Wolf Hollow eight-tenths of <br/>
a mile to Route 81. You can either park at the school and cross <br/>
back over, or pull off on the side of Wolf Hollow Road. Just to the <br/>
south of Wolf Hollow you will see the trail opening on Route 81.<br/>
<br/>
This one is not a loop! You will be on a flat, bowered, trail, which <br/>
parallels Wolf Hollow Road. This one is maintained by our local <br/>
Lions Club (thank you gentlemen!). When you see a large ledge <br/>
begin to loom on your left, you will also spot a rock-tripe-covered <br/>
rock on the left. Across from it, on your right, find a "keyhole" in <br/>
the rock wall. Through the keyhole, or by peering over the wall, <br/>
find an old stump and then find a letterbox hidden in it. Be sure to <br/>
read carefully so you don't miss the bonus on the way back.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you have enjoyed your tour of four of our KLCT trails. I <br/>
consider the bonus message our unofficial town motto; many of <br/>
us moved to town because of its rural quality. Watch for more <br/>
KLCT trail boxes! Bluebird.<br/>
