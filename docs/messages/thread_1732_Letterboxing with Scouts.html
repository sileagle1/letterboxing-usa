<br/>
There are a lot of Girl Scouts in CT who letterbox. In our own <br/>
service unit, it has reached enough popularity/curiosity that we are <br/>
planning a LB activity at our camporee this spring. The committee <br/>
will be making and planting 4 or so boxes at camp for the weekend, <br/>
and we will be making stamps as a craft project. The scouts will be <br/>
bringing their own log books, and each leader will have a stamp pad <br/>
for her troop. Then, we'll just pass out clues and set them off to <br/>
discover the joys of LBing at their leisure.<br/>
<br/>
For ideas on stamp carving, take a look at the archives.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

I have run into some resistance from a few scouters as far as letterboxing<br/>
is concerned. Here are a couple of concerns that they have had:<br/>
1. It has been thought that Letterboxing does not comply with the Leave No<br/>
Trace ethic of outdoorsmanship. We leave plastic with stuff in it outside<br/>
buried or stuck somewhere thereby leaving behind some evidence that man has<br/>
been there.(how do you all fee about this?)<br/>
2. The only way you could really incorporate Letterboxing into any scouting<br/>
program would be as a hobby type interest on an outing or as part of a Merit<br/>
Badge. Scouting does have a structured learning program for what it teaches.<br/>
Once again, these are comments I've heard from some hardened scouters. I<br/>
wrestle with them myself to be quite honest; especially the first one.<br/>
However I try to be as responsible as I possibly can regarding LNT.<br/>

explorers. I too learned the leave no trace philosophy which to me <br/>
has expanded to the "Kill only time, take only pictures, and leave <br/>
only footprints." There is no denying that letterboxing is <br/>
technically violating this policy. However, when I see the rape of <br/>
the landscape every day by unbridled development (God save Florida <br/>
because the people sure aren't doing it) I feel that any activity <br/>
encouraging people to get out into the wildnerness and appreciate <br/>
nature must be considered in the larger context. From that vantage <br/>
point the most important real meaning of the "leave only footprints" <br/>
adage to me is leaving nothing of harm to the system nor unsightly <br/>
for visitors. Hopefully letterboxes are inert to the system (don't <br/>
harm anything) and hidden well enough to avoid being seen, much less <br/>
unsightly. I do believe we have to be very careful to minimize any <br/>
disturbance of the surrounding bush. My 2c / rationalization.<br/>

This past week my sister invited me and my two children there to search for a letterbox, I never realized the trails were there before and I got such a different feeling climbing them than just being at the park. I for one felt close to nature and respected its ability  to camoflauge its self. We never found the letterbox but it was fun trying and all along I thought how I couln't wait to share this new found activity with others who I know appreciate the  great outdoors and a bit of a challange as well. I feel eager to look for more letterboxes and I feel it will be a wholesome activity for the whole family. Hopefuly my sons scout den will also approve I'll keep you all posted, and thanks again for all your responses, and to my sister The Ladybug for turning us on to letterboxing!</div> <div><br/>                                                             Regina aka (Mother Nature)</div> <div><br/></div> <blockquote> <div>----- Original Message -----</div> <div><b>From:</b> Eric J.
