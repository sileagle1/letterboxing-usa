friend I noticed a bit of a problem with the Washington State <br/>
listings.  There are so many new boxes in the Pierce and <br/>
Thurston County areas (due mostly to DVN2RCKR and friends) <br/>
that is quite confusing trying to locate boxes in a specific area.  <br/>
<br/>
I propose a re-organization of the listings for WA State.  Make a <br/>
new group for the listings called South Puget Sound.  It should <br/>
be Pierce County/Thurston County/Mason County.  <br/>
<br/>
This would give the needed room for all the S.Sound boxes <br/>
cropping up and also give Seattle/King County its needed room <br/>
too.  Also, this would keep boxes in Olympia from being lumped <br/>
together with boxes in Vancouver, WA.  Geographically speaking, <br/>
this would be much more consistent.<br/>
<br/>
Comments?<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  I know you webmasters and moderators are very busy, but <br/>
there are a lot of boxes still listed in the archives of the whats <br/>
new section that need to be added to the main list.<br/>
