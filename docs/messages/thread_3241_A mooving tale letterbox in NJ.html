     Went out to try and find the mooving tale letterbox today.  I figured <br/>
out the correct location and did indeed find the starting point, but for the <br/>
life of me I could not find the old telephone pole that was mentioned in the <br/>
clue.  I must have searched for close to an hour to find it.  I'm not asking <br/>
where the box is, but any other clues might help, lol.  Please reply to my <br/>
email address and not to the talk list if that helps, thanks!<br/>
