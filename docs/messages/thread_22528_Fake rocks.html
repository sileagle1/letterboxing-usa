                    <div class="plaintext-content">A few years back, on this list, there was a short<br/>
lived thread regarding the idea of making "fake rocks"<br/>
to hide letterboxes under.  Within the past year I<br/>
have encountered a few these fake rocks and they seem<br/>
to be a good idea.  I have been researching the idea<br/>
of using Hypertufa recipes (used to make garden<br/>
planters)for making the "fake rocks."  My question is<br/>
two fold: 1.has anyone tried the Hpertufa method and<br/>
2.if yes how do they stand up in the weather? Lastly,<br/>
if you know of a better recipe are you willing to<br/>
share?  You can email me off list if you are.  Than<br/>
you.<br/>
