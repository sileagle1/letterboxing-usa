London Ferries:<br/>
<br/>
Take a left out of the parking lot and up to the<br/>
Rebecca statue, at the fork in the road. Go straight<br/>
thru and follow Southeast Road. It will take you past<br/>
the Southeast Lighthouse and a painted rock. Continue<br/>
on that road for about 1 mile. After a big pond,Fresh<br/>
Pond, there will be a left(West Side Road). Take it<br/>
and follow for about 1/4-1/2 mile. On your left will<br/>
be Rodman's Hollow, enter at the second Rodman's<br/>
Hollow sign.<br/>
Enter the trailhead and continue on past the info<br/>
board. Go past Old Mill Road and enter the turnstyle<br/>
on your left. Follow the sign for the "Short Loop". Go<br/>
through the stone wall and then take your immediate<br/>
right. Go through that stone wall and take a left. <br/>
You will follow the length of that stone wall, even<br/>
when you don't see it. You will now be on a dirt<br/>
road/trail. Follow the 'ez' markings painted on rocks<br/>
along the trail.  Go straight, past several side<br/>
trails and a 4-way intersection. Continue on until you<br/>
see the water. From the rock at the end of the trail<br/>
line up the flag pole at 100 degrees.  Follow the<br/>
trail that heads towards the house for 20 feet.  Turn<br/>
around and look under the white rock in the wall.<br/>
