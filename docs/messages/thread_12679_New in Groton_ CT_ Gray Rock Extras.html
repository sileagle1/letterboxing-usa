there were 3 vehicles parked at Gray Rock this afternoon when I was <br/>
bringing my father-in-law home from the hospital - maybe 5pm or so?<br/>
<br/>
I take it our clues were adequate?? These are our  first actual <br/>
boxes planted besides a HH and a traveller so my only hiding <br/>
experience was with Butterfly last week.   And the HH left at <br/>
Canvasback was an added first-finder bonus : )<br/>
