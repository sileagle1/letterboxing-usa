Fall Gathering at Yankee Springs Rec Area in Middleville, MI.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This will be a traditional type of gathering at the Yankee Springs <br/>
picnic shelter with a potluck at noon -- there is a grill there and <br/>
also electricity.  The gathering will get going about 8:00 a.m. with <br/>
exchanges, meet/greet old new friends, etc.<br/>
<br/>
A few other highlights:<br/>
<br/>
RHYME TYME CLUE EXCHANGE GAME:  We will be playing the Rhyme Tyme <br/>
Clue Exchange Game, a variation of the Clue Exchange Game devised by <br/>
Scarab of the Doubtful Guests. The premise of the game is similar to <br/>
the Clue board game, in which there are a variety of SUSPECTS, <br/>
WEAPONS and ROOMS, and the object of the game is to use <br/>
cards/questions to determine which suspect killed Mr. Boddy, with <br/>
which weapon, in which room. <br/>
<br/>
Similarly, in our game there will be SUSPECTS, WEAPONS and <br/>
LOCATIONS, with the object being to determine which suspect killed <br/>
Mother Goose, with which weapon, in which location. Instead of <br/>
cards/questions, players will collect stamps and extraneous clues to <br/>
eliminate the innocent and pinpoint the guilty. <br/>

<br/>
WORKSHOP:  We're trying to keep the schedule loose and flexible and <br/>
have decided to have only one workshop -- topic yet to be decided <br/>
(we are looking for suggestions for workshop topic and welcome <br/>
ideas, particularly topics that have not been covered at previous <br/>
gatherings).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LETTERBOXES:  There are a handful of letterboxes already in this <br/>
park.  We think this is an awesome park with a great set of hiking <br/>
trails (over 15 miles of trails), not to mention the central <br/>
location between Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo.  We definitely think <br/>
this park could use some more permanently planted letterboxes so we <br/>
are encouraging anyone who is able to plant some boxes here between <br/>
now and October.<br/>
<br/>
Alternately (we know it if not feasible for everyone to just hop on <br/>
over to Yankee Spring to plant letterboxes), you can create a box <br/>
for the gathering and mail it to us to plant and do clues.  There is <br/>
no specific theme for gathering boxes, so let your imagination run <br/>
wild! How about Halloween themed boxes, maybe Autumn themed or even <br/>
playing off the name/history of the park (do a little research on <br/>
this).  Another great theme idea would be fairy tales to coincide <br/>
with the Clue Exchange Game theme...  be creative and have fun with <br/>
these!<br/>
<br/>

sending letterboxes and how to RSVP), see the gathering web page <br/>
