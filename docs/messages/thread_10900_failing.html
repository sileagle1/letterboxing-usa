I have attempted to find a certain letterbox 3 times now. I've found <br/>

been eaten by the cows that were now in the field.  Next, "was at the right<br/>
spot", but now the box was well hidden by blackberry briars, beyond my<br/>
reach.  The third box, found the start and the marker, but could not get<br/>
paces/steps to work out to a reasonable place.  Finally, gave up and was<br/>
ready to move on.  Decided to give it one more try, but ignore the clues and<br/>
look to see where I would be if I were a letterbox.  Spotted it on the first<br/>
pass!  Made it to the fourth site, found the location, but could not zero in<br/>
on the right location before the sun went down.  Still walked out in the<br/>
dark (where I felt I had been most of the afternoon :-)<br/>

that is so familiar.  I thought I'd go nuts repeating "where the long <br/>
meets the tall" clue from a box in Pocohantas State Park, Richmond, <br/>
VA.  If you really want to find the box, you need to do what I did.  <br/>
Take Celtic Pride letterboxing with you.  They can find anything!!!<br/>

<div>I tried one box 4 times before I found it. I was 
convinced it was MIA, but a friend who had found it (as well as the box placer) 
kept telling me "It's still there". At least it was close to my home, so going 
back was easy. That 4 times doesn't include the 2 times I couldn't look for it 
because of people in the area. :-) I did finally find it though! </div>
<div>I was even counting the number of boxes I had 
'attempts' on for awhile, but decided to stick to just the regular numbers. I 
figured I spent more time looking for the boxes I <strong>couldn't</strong> 
find, so I should count them :-)</div>
