(thanks Lone Pony!) I still have space left on the list. If you're<br/>
interested, please send me your letterboxing name, real name, and<br/>
mailing address and I will put you on the list. FYI- I ended up<br/>
carving a different image than the one I originally intended, so I'm<br/>
going to call this box "Sam the Camera Man" instead of "Candid<br/>
Camera". I guess if you sign up to get the box you'll see why. Please<br/>
send me this info ASAP so I can get this thing moving. Thanks!<br/>

something else (scenery, letterboxing, etc.)" Sorry about that. Guess it <br/>
doesn't make a whole lot of sense as written.<br/>
