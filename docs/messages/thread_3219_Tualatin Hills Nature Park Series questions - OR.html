                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm new to letterboxing and so far I'm really enjoying it.  Today I took my <br/>
daughter to the Tualatin Hills Nature Park to look for boxes.  You know, <br/>
I've lived within 5 miles of that place for the last 12 years and never <br/>
even known it was there...<br/>
<br/>
So how hard are these boxes hidden?  We easily found box #1 (and the pad in <br/>
#1 is pretty much full).  That was fun and exciting.  With our hopes set <br/>
high we started off for box #2.  I'm not sure that we ever found the right <br/>
spot to start looking.  But we never found the box.  I wanted to quit and <br/>
move onto the next box after about 5 minutes but my daughter said "Nancy <br/>
Drew never gives up, Dad."  I finally convinced her to move on to the next <br/>
box by explaining that the box might be missing.<br/>
<br/>
For boxes 3 and 4 I KNOW we were in the right spot.  But the boxes were <br/>
either hidden way harder than I expected or missing.  Should I expect the <br/>
boxes to be buried?  I didn't know how much excavating I could do before <br/>
park rangers (are there park rangers there?) would be escorting me away.<br/>
<br/>
We made a half-hearted attempt at number 5.  But by then we'd walked 2.5 <br/>
miles (that's hard on a 10 year old...) and only gotten one stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm dying to go back and search more diligently but if the boxes are <br/>
just missing then I'd rather go somewhere where I can find them.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, there was a note up that said the Oak trail would be closed from <br/>
9/4/01 till 9/21/01 for improvements.<br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful hobby this seems to be.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; So how hard are these boxes hidden?<br/>
 Some of them are tricky.  Out of a possible 18 stamps at Tualatin, I <br/>
only got 10.  And I do think that some might be missing. (have to <br/>
check with Ryan C.--he always finds some that I think are missing)<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to quit and <br/>
&gt; move onto the next box after about 5 minutes but my daughter said <br/>
"Nancy <br/>
&gt; Drew never gives up, Dad."  I finally convinced her to move on to <br/>
the next <br/>
&gt; box by explaining that the box might be missing.<br/>
Number 2 was there in July when I hunted it...but you have to make <br/>
sure you are starting from the correct boardwalk.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For boxes 3 and 4 I KNOW we were in the right spot.  But the boxes <br/>
were <br/>
&gt; either hidden way harder than I expected or missing. <br/>
I also missed #3 but got #4<br/>
<br/>
  Should I expect the <br/>
&gt; boxes to be buried?  <br/>
No, they might be covered by leaves or twigs, or under pieces of bark <br/>
or a stone, but they would not be buried.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We made a half-hearted attempt at number 5.  <br/>
I missed #5,#6,and #7  and I got #8<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now I'm dying to go back and search more diligently <br/>
You should also search for the Rick's Farm Series they are also in <br/>
Tualatin Park and are gorgeous stamps by Paisley Orca.  I found <br/>
Quickie the Rabbit, Bubbles the fish, Lucifer the Goat, Oroville the <br/>
pig, Lima the llama and Cheetah the Tabby Cat.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but if the boxes are <br/>
&gt; just missing then I'd rather go somewhere where I can find them.<br/>
Tualatin gives you great odds for finding letterboxes.  There are so <br/>
many in one park that you are sure to come away with something to <br/>
show for your trouble.  What is depressing is traveling for several <br/>
hours and hiking miles for a single box and then not being able to <br/>
find it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What a wonderful hobby this seems to be.<br/>
It has been a fun hobby for me.  I was at the Smith and Bybee Lakes <br/>
letterbox the other day and that was a relatively easy hike and an <br/>
easy find, with a beautiful stamp to show for it!<br/>
I can also recommend the Tryon Creek Park letterboxes (but first you <br/>
have to solve the cryptic clues)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck and Keep Hunting<br/>
--Amanda from Seattle<br/>
<br/>
PS--And to Plug my own boxes--If you come up to the Seattle area, the <br/>
3 Schmitz Park boxes are very simple.   Also Mischief in WA placed 3 <br/>
letterboxes at Snoqualmie Falls that are pretty easy to find and <br/>
Gorgeous Stamps too!--Oh, and Dash Point Park has 2 boxes that aren't <br/>
too hard either.<br/>

RIght.  That's why I'm not sure we were at the right spot.  We never did <br/>
see the predator etched in stone.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I also missed #3 but got #4<br/>
<br/>
I'll have to go back and look for 4 again.<br/>

Yeah, that would be annoying.  Especially when you don't know if the box <br/>
was there and you missed it or if the box was just missing.<br/>

have reported that Clarabel the Hen Turkey, Tasha the German Shephard<br/>
and Rex the Retriever are missing, so you may want to skip those boxes<br/>
since others have been disappointed looking for them.  Otherwise, I<br/>
believe the rest are still out there in the park.  I haven't been back<br/>
out there since late April, but come Fall I may have the chance to check<br/>
them out again, and perhaps replace the ones that are missing.  Have a<br/>
good time!<br/>
