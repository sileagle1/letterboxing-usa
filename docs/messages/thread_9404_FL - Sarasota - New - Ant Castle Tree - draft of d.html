a draft but I'm posting them just in case for Thanksgiving holiday <br/>
boxers.  I have a website for my clues and a webmaster for that.  <br/>
Knights of Columbo I hope will post the clue there later and post <br/>

DRAFT of new Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Ant Castle Tree<br/>
Placed by The Doubtful Guests<br/>
Thanksgiving, 2002<br/>
Sarasota County<br/>
Sarasota, Florida<br/>
hand made stamp<br/>
dogs on leash ok<br/>
easy 10 minute walk<br/>
<br/>
This end of Sarasota Bay was once a dumping ground.  Now flora and <br/>
fauna have been restored with mangroves, small tidal streams, ponds <br/>
and a boardwalk nature walk called the Sarasota Bay Walk.  It is <br/>
still kinda trashy but we saw a lot of interesting plants and <br/>
creatures.  It is just before the Mote Marine Aquarium and the <br/>
Pelican Man Sanctuary.  After you turn off the main road towards Mote <br/>
and Pelican turn immediately right into a small parking lot at the <br/>
sign for Sarasota Bay Walk.  <br/>
<br/>
Examine the map at the entrance to the bay walk.  Your goal is on <br/>
the "Hill".  Follow the boardwalk past the coca cola pond.  <br/>
Apparently the color is due to the mangrove's tanic acid.  Turn right <br/>
just before the bay watch over look.  Take the next boardwalk left.  <br/>
It will change from boardwalk to trail.  Look for the prickle pillow <br/>
plants.  Trail changes back to boardwalk.  When the boardwalk ends <br/>
again, stop.  You should be looking at a double tree that splits into <br/>
many large branches.  Step behind this tree and take a bearing.  At <br/>
215 degrees is the Ant Castle Tree.  You may have to move further in <br/>
to see it.  It is about 30 steps away though you have to go around <br/>
some trees to get to it.<br/>
<br/>
When I was there I saw fine dirt piles at the base because walking <br/>
all up and down one of the large limbs was a steady stream of ants.  <br/>
You've been warned.  I brushed off a dozen ants after placing the <br/>
box.  <br/>
<br/>
Duck under to the left of the tree.  About one third clockwise around <br/>
the base you will find the box stuck in under some leaves.  Take it <br/>
away from the ants to stamp in.  Please replace the box carefully in <br/>
the same place so it doesn't wash away in the rain and cover it with <br/>
leaves so it is not easily seen.  There is something of a path <br/>
leading to the Ant Castle Tree.  I don't know why.  Perhaps someone <br/>
is studying it.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing on the path returns you in a loop.  Afterwards be sure to <br/>
visit the Pelican Man Sanctuary.  There is a letterbox there that I <br/>
hope is restored by now. <br/>
<br/>
