quite different from the Cincinnati area tho!  Urban boxing requires a lot<br/>
more travel time.<br/>
<br/>
Found three great stamps--Grosse Pointe Light House was fantastic--the beach<br/>
was so much fun for the kids and I was awed by Lake Michigan.  Hard to<br/>
beleive that is only a lake!  Stamp and box in great condition tho the<br/>
hiding place looks like it is dangerously near a popular teen spot, judging<br/>
by the trash in the area.  I appreciated the recent thread on re-hiding<br/>
boxes and took extra care to make sure  this one was well concealed.<br/>
<br/>
Also found Cars on a Stick--what a hoot!  A bit disappointed that many of<br/>
hte sculptures were in disrepair but still worth the visit.  Great hotdog<br/>
stand for lunch near by!  Was unable to replace it tho, as school let out<br/>
while we were stamping in (in the car) and a flock of teens congregated at<br/>
the hiding spot.  I was forced to bring it home and will contact the placer<br/>
to try and return it.<br/>
<br/>
Island park was missing--also a popular teen spot apparently.  I insisted<br/>
the kids leave and used gloves to  sort through all the trash--broken<br/>
bottles, snack wrappers and less savory items.  Still couldn't find it.<br/>
Again, will contact placer off list.<br/>
<br/>
Napierville River Walk was awesome--the clues were just clever enough to<br/>
make this a challenge, which I appreciated--and the park was neat enough<br/>
that the kids didn't mind mommy wandering around and mutteirng to herself.<br/>
If you are ever in the are, do NOT miss this one.  We are going to go back<br/>
when the Carillon is done.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, all three of these were must haves.   We spent so much time  at<br/>
the parks I was unable to hit the others I had planned.  To me, that signals<br/>
a darn good hunt!  Guess I will  have to return sometime....<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to the Chicago Area boxers who persevere--I had a great time!<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes--two CInci area HH were released.....<br/>
