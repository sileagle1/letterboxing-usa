Alum Cave Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Alum Cave Trail   is five and a half miles with a vertical climb of around<br/>
2600 feet. Strangely, most claim the easiest is via Newfound Gap, an<br/>
eight -mile trip, but only a vertical climb of 1200 feet<br/>
<br/>
The Alum Cave trail is well known as the shortest route to Mount LeConte<br/>
(about 5.5 miles each way). The majority of people who take this beautiful<br/>
hike, however, do not venture all the way to LeConte. And the vast majority<br/>
of beauty along this trail is found by the time you reach the "cave." The<br/>
first or second week of June is just incredible for purple rhododendron<br/>
along this trail. Mountain Laurel is also waxing near this time. The very<br/>
wide trail follows a quaint creek bed for the first mile or so to Arch<br/>
ck   - an interesting hole through a shaly spur. The trail then heads up the<br/>
base of Mount LeConte. The trail is usually crowded, but wide and enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the hike up to Arch Rock. After pausing there, continue on through<br/>
Arch Rock and on past the first bridge you cross. Find a large log that has<br/>
a section cut out to allow passage on the trail.  Go 6 paces north to an<br/>
uprooted tree on the east side. There on the north-east side among the roots<br/>
you will find the Alum Caves Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
After stamping in, and replacing the box, continue on up the trail to Alum<br/>
Caves have a light lunch and enjoy the view and the wonder of the bluffs.<br/>
The material has a slightly salty taste to it and it was mined for some<br/>
unknown purpose.<br/>
The material is also loose, but footing is pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
The trail may have others on it so on your return trip, make sure you avert<br/>
your eyes from the box location.  Just kidding. Enjoy the hike back.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know the condition of the box. Abe and Gail   x9a3@vnet.net<br/>

   ...  peace .... Abe<br/>
