                    <div class="plaintext-content">Weird news here in little Dartmoor (Rock Creek, Oregon).  I was out at<br/>
the creek throwing rocks and sticks with the boys &amp; decided to see if<br/>
anyone had signed in to Rock Creek #1 , now that I have replaced it...<br/>
again!  Mitch actually dropped the box off for me... I had been trying<br/>
to get my "mother of all sheds" complete among other things...  So...<br/>
anyway, as we were sampling blackberries &amp; noticing that Mitch was the<br/>
only one who had been by, lo and behold, the original box was sighted in<br/>
the bushes nearby.  We opened it and found that the little so-and-so who<br/>
took it had returned all of the pages that had stamps (thank goodness)<br/>
and 2 of the 3 stamps I carved at one time or another for that box.  The<br/>
otter has returned!!  As has the heron.  Unfortunately they took the<br/>
goose stamp and all of the rest of the little notepad, but for some<br/>
reason returned the rest.  I was really happy to get back the stamped<br/>
pages, Daniel Servatius had visited with a beautiful carved stamp by<br/>
Susan Davis and Mitch had been by at least twice &amp; probably three times.<br/>
<br/>
I have decided to move this box to a less tempting spot.  I'm kinda<br/>
ticked off about that, because the location is really perfect for a<br/>
letterbox.  I have a sneaking suspicion who is taking &amp; returning the<br/>
box, but since I have no proof, I can do nothing except move along. <br/>
Anyway.... the box has been relocated &amp; when I dream up some<br/>
appropriately clever clues, I'll get Mitch to change them.<br/>

'scuse me? Did we vote on this little Dartmoor thing? How much<br/>
rain did you say you get there?<br/>
(Congrats on the find of your box and stamps! Great that some stamps<br/>
and some of the notebook are show up again, though I'm sorry one of<br/>
the stamps is still missing....)<br/>

Please compare weather patterns, pubs per square hectare, and the amount<br/>
of letterboxes...<br/>

hey... if the box fits, place it!<br/>

Yes... well... that's all very well and good... but these things<br/>
cannot be rushed, you know. There must be long term studies<br/>
over several decades with the cooperation of entities such as<br/>
the National Weather Kahunas and the government agency<br/>
of Tidbits and Trivia before such a title can be bestowed.<br/>

well... certainly!!  I am experienced with government decision<br/>

achieve that.  Please contact me when your focus group/study committee<br/>
