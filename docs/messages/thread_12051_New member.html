This is just my personal opinion, but I would suggest you wait to place a<br/>
box until you have found a few in the area you are considering.  I think it<br/>
is helpful to see what "works" best as far as concealment and packaging.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know you have read the FAQs (good for you!)  but nothing replaces<br/>
experience.  I learned the most when I was able to hook up with another<br/>
local boxer or two.  When you do start hunting, be sure to  rehide the box<br/>
carefully for the next lucky treasure hunter!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You will have a great time in Connecticut-the mesa of letterboxing.  I just<br/>
returned from a trip up there. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is a newboxers group that you would probably enjoy; I am sorry I do<br/>
not have the link. It is another yahoo group.  And I bet there is a local<br/>
group for the Florida or South East as well.  Enjoy yourself and welcome to<br/>
the community!<br/>

several of us in Florida are on it.<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-southeast/<br/>
<br/>
If I remember right, the FL state parks allow boxes and geocaches with the <br/>
permission of the park manager, but it's been awhile since I read the <br/>
information, and I can't find the website I used right now, cause the link doesn't work <br/>
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any boxes near you at all?   I agree with whoever said it's a <br/>
good idea to find some before you try planting.<br/>

&gt; This is just my personal opinion, but I would<br/>
&gt; suggest you wait to place a<br/>
&gt; box until you have found a few in the area you are<br/>

&gt; is helpful to see what "works" best as far as<br/>
&gt; concealment and packaging.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
*****While I agree with Mama Stork wholeheartedly - I<br/>
had big plans to plant my first box before I ever<br/>
found one, then I found one and realized I may not be<br/>
as quick as I thought I would be in planting - but I<br/>
do believe that you shouldn't wait TOO long to plant<br/>
one.  <br/>
<br/>
We had a discussion on the Texas list not too long ago<br/>
about how planters make better finders and re-hiders. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once you check out the local situation and see what's<br/>
customary in your area, go for it!  Don't be<br/>
heartbroken if you lose some at first, because you<br/>
probably aren't as good a hider as you will become. <br/>
Just persevere!<br/>

&gt; had big plans to plant my first box before I ever<br/>
&gt; found one, then I found one and realized I may not be<br/>
&gt; as quick as I thought I would be in planting - but I<br/>
&gt; do believe that you shouldn't wait TOO long to plant<br/>
&gt; one.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We had a discussion on the Texas list not too long ago<br/>
&gt; about how planters make better finders and re-hiders. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once you check out the local situation and see what's<br/>
&gt; customary in your area, go for it!  Don't be<br/>
&gt; heartbroken if you lose some at first, because you<br/>
&gt; probably aren't as good a hider as you will become. <br/>
&gt; Just persevere!<br/>

I haven't made it to Tampa for boxing yet.   Sarasota's the closest I got <br/>
last year.   If you ever want to come south, though, we'd love to have you find <br/>
our boxes.   And there are some nice ones in the Keys, too.<br/>
<br/>
I keep sending   out vibrations to get the Orlando people to throw a <br/>
gathering this year, but I'm not sure they're getting my telepathic message!   <g><br/>
