                    <div class="plaintext-content">Im sorry, I guess I didnt make the Hollywood cemetery box very <br/>
clear.  Ok.  There are two boxes in Hollywood cemetery<br/>
Furled but not Forgotten LB, and Hollywood Cemetery LB.<br/>
On the page for the Hollywood Cemetery box, there are now two <br/>
sets of clues for the same box.  It is the second set of clues that <br/>
are correct.  I moved the box and sent in new clues for it.  So can <br/>
the first set of clues for the box be erased?  Thank you.  I am <br/>
concerned that people will spend time looking for a box that isn't <br/>
there, and the reason I moved it is that the former spot will really <br/>
not hold up to traffic very well.<br/>
