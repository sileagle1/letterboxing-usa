  3. You do not insult me, my carving (I'm getting better, really!), my <br/>
  clues, or where the heck I put it. Why do you think I am making fake <br/>
  rocks.<br/>
<br/>
  Other than that, it is nice to know when folks have been by and found <br/>
  I need to replace something or liked what I did.<br/>

Dear Pam,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your respect. Of course I make fake rocks! And I also <br/>
hollow out rocks (travertine) to hide boxes inside. If you head over <br/>
to my webpages <br/>
http://webpages.charter.net/astroweaver/letterboxing/letterbox.html<br/>
and scroll down to look for the link to pics of my fake rocks.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a 0.5 mm gouge to do detail carving now so I am hoping <br/>
that my carving improves. <br/>
<br/>
Out here on the Left Coast,<br/>
