No, but I thought I was going to have to "borrow" a box tonight and bring it <br/>
back tomorrow night.  :-)  I drove about an hour and a half to get to the <br/>
university campus.<br/>
<br/>
The box was nicely hidden under a bridge on the campus.  I found the box <br/>
while nobody was around, went over and sat under a tree and tried to look like an <br/>
elderly art student while I did my stamping.  Got all finished, got the box <br/>
packed up, walked back towards the bridge, and a MommaBear, PapaBear, with a <br/>
couple of little BabyBears had stopped to play at fishing right where I had to go <br/>
to return the box!<br/>
<br/>
So I took the box with me and went and found the second box on the campus, <br/>
figuring that it wouldn't take the BabyBears long to get bored stiff with their <br/>
"fishing".  Came back, they were still there!  Parents were fishing while <br/>
BabyBears were doing cartwheels along the bank.  I went and found the third box on <br/>
the campus, came back, and they were still there!  BabyBears were now playing <br/>
leapfrog along the bank.<br/>
<br/>
Kept the box, got in my car, and went to fill up the tank with gas, came back <br/>
and they were still there!!!  Got back in my car, and tooled on down to McD's <br/>
to get a chocolate sundae, came back and YES!  They were gone!  It was fairly <br/>
well after dark by then so I guess fishin' was called on account of darkness. <br/>
 Thank heavens.  :-)    <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes! And it is funny because I am your island neighbor! It has<br/>
happened twice to me...once on my Back Beach letterbox when I was just<br/>
checking on it, and another time when when I was checking on the<br/>
report of my SeaStar being missing. I came across a couple looking<br/>
VERY nonchalant with their paper clues and logbook and "lunch". Only<br/>
another letterboxer would know what was going on! I asked them if they<br/>
were letterboxing and they admitted it, so we had a nice conversation.<br/>
I have seen other people letterboxing while I am letterboxing<br/>
too...those confused looks of people counting things in graveyards is<br/>
a dead giveaway.<br/>
<br/>
Boy, we sure do get a lot of letterboxing traffic up here! We could<br/>
market letterboxing vacations!<br/>

PS Glad your box is ok and in place!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a similar experience with the Father of the Bride letterbox <br/>
in Framingham, MA.  It's hidden in a cemetery.  We found the box <br/>
with little problem, and carried it to the car to exchange stamps.  <br/>
While we were doing this, another car drove by and parked very near <br/>
where this letterbox was hidden.  The driver got out, opened the <br/>
trunk, removed a folding chair and other things, and proceed to set-<br/>
up near a grave plot not too far from the letterboxes hiding <br/>
location.  Sitting down in the chair, the visitor then opened a <br/>
beverage and a book.<br/>
<br/>
While it should be expected that cemeteries will receive visitors, <br/>
we had never seen someone camp out at a grave like this.  Not being <br/>
able to return the box, we took it with us as we searched for <br/>
another box in the same town.  It took about an hour or so to find <br/>
that box, and maybe 1 hours in total by the time we returned to the <br/>
cemetery.  Fortunately, the visitor had departed, and we replaced <br/>
the box.<br/>

You should see me when I go to visit my father.  Mom and Dad are buried side <br/>
by side.  Mom made me promise I wouldn't visit.  She was never into that sort <br/>
of thing and thought it "stupid."  Dad died 10 years, 11 months, and 3 weeks <br/>
after Mom.  Dad made me give him a deathbed promise to visit, and promise to <br/>
visit fairly frequently, he was very insistent.  OKaaaaaaaaaaaaay.<br/>
<br/>
Well, Dad absolutely adored my little Jerk dog and would read to him all the <br/>
time.  So when I go to the cemetery, I go with a blanket, a book, water for <br/>
Jerk, and soda for me.  And chocolate for me.  And little hot dog pieces for <br/>
Jerk.  As I'm spreading everything out on the ground over the graves <br/>
picnic-style, I tell Mom "It's OK Mom, I'm not here to visit you, Jerk and I are just here <br/>
to visit Dad so don't get angry."  Then Jerk and I settle down and I read a <br/>
chapter aloud to him.  Next visit, we do the next chapter.<br/>
<br/>
Jerk is very very attentive and listens to every word I'm reading.  He always <br/>
did that with Dad too, it was hysterical.  I can just imagine what anyone <br/>
thinks who happens to see and hear this going on in the cemetery.  And I often <br/>
take my shoes off to get comfortable so folks get to see my mismatched socks.  <br/>
<br/>
The Li'l Jerk is close to 16 now, so I don't know how much longer I'll be <br/>
doing it with him but he loves it.  And I sure hope Dad does and that I'm not <br/>
doin' it all for nothin'.  :-)   Because if I am, I'm gonna have a little word <br/>
with him later on in life, I truly will.  <br/>

&gt; I've thought about almost the same thing. I was going to laminate a<br/>
&gt; card that said something like, "Looking for something? Don't wander<br/>
&gt; too far, it will be back shortly."<br/>
<br/>
 The last time this happen I got the idea of<br/>
&gt; making<br/>
&gt; &gt; a small drink coaster size disc to put in the spot.  Something like<br/>
&gt; &gt; the "out to lunch clock" people put on their office doors when they<br/>

I planted the N.E.S.S. #1, Jamestown, RI, and, like any eager new planter, went to check on it the next day.  What a newbie!<br/>
It wasn't on the shelf in the library!  I thought "Oh, MAN!  I *just* planted it and now someone took it!".  Then I saw some guy replacing it - it was a guy named Pete.  We introduced ourselves and I had a great sigh of relief (and got to meet THE Pete).<br/>
The nerve of that guy, 'finding' while I'm 'checking'!<br/>

  Subject: [LbNA] Concerning "Missing" letterboxes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I recently heard from a boxer who could not find one of my boxes.  <br/>
  Just to be sure, I went and checked and the box was missing.  I <br/>
  adjusted my clues to reflect this, with the note that I would replace <br/>
  it as soon as possible.  Much to my surprise someone who didn't know <br/>
  it was missing found it this week!  Apparently someone had been <br/>
  stamping in when I went looking for it.  There was a family on the <br/>
  beach that day and I watched them for a while from a distance, just <br/>
  in case, but they didn't go near any of the three boxes near this <br/>
  beach, so I figured the box was just gone.  The strangest thing of <br/>
  all is that this is the second time this has happened to me.  I went <br/>
  to check on one of my boxes one evening just as Wanda and Pete and <br/>
  some others had put the whole thing in their car to try to dry it out <br/>
  while they looked for my second box, which I pulled once I discovered <br/>
  the first box was "missing"!<br/>
<br/>
  I am curious to know if anyone else has had this happen?  Have you <br/>
  checked on your box when someone was stamping in and therefore <br/>
  thought the box was gone?<br/>
