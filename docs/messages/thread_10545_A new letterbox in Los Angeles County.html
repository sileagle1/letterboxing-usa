Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I cannot seem to access the letterboxing talk list from my computer.  <br/>
I have done it and subscribed from other locations, but somehow it is <br/>
not working from my home.  Consequently, I am asking for your help in <br/>
posting two letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
The Succulent Box<br/>

County:	Los Angeles<br/>
Nearest City:	Pasadena<br/>
Location:	Easy, but tricky<br/>
Terrain:	Easy<br/>
Distance:	 mile roundtrip<br/>

This letterbox is located at the LA County Arboretum.  To find the <br/>
Arboretum, exit the 210 Freeway (East or West) on Baldwin Avenue.<br/>
Turn South on Baldwin Avenue, the Arboretum is on the west side of <br/>
Baldwin<br/>
Once at the Arboretum, Find parking and enter at the Entrance <br/>
Pavilion.  Admission fee is $5.00 for adults; $3.00 for seniors and <br/>
students; $1.00 for children 5-12 years.<br/>
<br/>
Everything about this letterbox is HOT.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, it is so hot that we don't want you to get burned.  It will <br/>
be best to visit this letterbox early in the morning when there are <br/>
few visitors at the park.  The Arboretum opens at 9 am daily.<br/>
<br/>
Find the place in the gardens where the heat loving plants grow.  You <br/>
will find a grove of succulent plants.<br/>
