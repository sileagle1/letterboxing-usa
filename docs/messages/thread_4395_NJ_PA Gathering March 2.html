                    <div class="plaintext-content">As an update to our ongoing discussion about our March 2nd gathering, I was at <br/>
the Ship Inn last weekend and took a closer inspection of the back room. There <br/>
are six tables of four seats each, for a total of 24 seats. I'm thinking that <br/>
there are going to be more people at our gathering (probably around 30-40, <br/>
considering the responses I've seen on the message boards). People have said <br/>
that the Raubsville Inn has more space available, so I'm leaning towards that <br/>
venue as the better option.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone confirm that they have more space available? And, if they do, <br/>
would someone familiar with the place get in touch with them, to ask that <br/>
they hold the room open for us? I'd do it myself, but since I've never been <br/>
there I don't know what the layout is like or which rooms would be best for us.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to propose that we set a meeting time of 4:00, for an hour or so of <br/>
chit-chat and stamp exchanging, and plan on having dinner from 5:00 or 5:30 <br/>
onwards. That way, people with little folks or travellers who have a distance <br/>
to drive won't have to get home too too late.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
