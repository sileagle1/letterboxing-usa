letterboxing obsession. Lately, I have been astonished by the plethora<br/>
of postal boxes that are criss-crossing the US. Even thought I don't<br/>
consider these boxes as Finds, they are a wonderful way to enjoy the<br/>
carving skills of other letterboxers. I have fond memories of the<br/>
first "letterbox that finds you" which came to me in the summer of<br/>
2001, the famed Flutterby, created by one of the finest artists<br/>
involved in our hobby, Legerdemaine.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, this was the first of its kind and was an amazing<br/>
work of quality craftsmanship. Since there are so many new folks in<br/>
our ranks, there are probably those who are unaware of this Opus. I<br/>
thought due credit should be given to Legerdemaine for initiating<br/>
letterboxing by mail. The beautifully carved stamp was encased in a<br/>
handcrafted wooden box, which had seperate compartments inside holding<br/>
a handbound address book, a handbound logbook and the stamp. The books<br/>
both had covers made of wood. Letterboxers from coast to coast were<br/>
lucky enough to enjoy Flutterby before it was retired.<br/>
<br/>
Just as much as I admire the fine work of this craftsman, I miss<br/>
seeing his posts on the Talk List. They were invariably clever,<br/>
sometimes devious and always entertaining. Kudos for the contributions<br/>
to Letterboxing, Legerdemaine. We know you are out there. May you<br/>
continue to create Opi (and mischief) of superior quality in the<br/>
coming year. <br/>

Oh,  I don't know.... he's caused me many headaches and hours of <br/>
frustration.  I cannot tell you how many of his boxes I've seeked <br/>
during the last month (four in the last week!) and come up empty <br/>
handed almost every time. Yes, his carvings are nice, but.... <br/>
apparently most are unobtainable but for the few blessed. If it <br/>
weren't for the fact he's from my homestate, I'd swear off his boxes <br/>
completely.  I don't handle disappointment well...my burden I know ;)<br/>
Oh well...I'm off to TRY to find another of those elusive monsters <br/>
tomorrow! Kstar<br/>
