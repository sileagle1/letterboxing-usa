The <br/>date 8/10 seems to be the clear <br/>&gt; winner. The rough plan is as follows: Let's get together for a <br/>picnic lunch around noon at Balch Creek/<br/>&gt; Macleay Park in Portland, OR. There are only about eight parking <br/>spaces so it could be a challenge to find <br/>&gt; a spot. I know letterboxers are creative thinkers and there are <br/>lots of trailheads that connect to the <br/>&gt; trails in this park. We can take a couple of hours to meet and <br/>greet as well as swapping clues for all <br/>&gt; those new boxes that many of us intend to hide for this event. <br/>After lunch, those who want, can hit the <br/>&gt; trails and seek out the hidden treasures. Sound OK? Any further <br/>ideas are welcome.

there.  Mitch did a VERY clever job of placing this box.  It's been a<br/>
while since we found it, but as I recall, it took us more than one try.<br/>
The clues aren't particularly hard, but finding the box itself was.<br/>
