<div>OK, the logical choice seems to be SATURDAY 28 SEP 
2002. Due to the fact that it looks like a few *out of towners* will be joining 
us from WA and CT, it would make it a little easier on everyone to have a *rest 
day* before returning to the hustle and bustle of the real world.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So.......SATURDAY....28 SEP 02    it 
is....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyone know if the G-man has had any luck with 
Quantico.....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If not I propose meeting:</div>
<div><strong>A:</strong>     In DC at the National 
Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden  (there is also a live Jazz band 
that performs there by the fountain every Friday at 6:00 PM if anyone wants to 
check that out)</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>B:   </strong>Any one of the number of Parks in the MD, DC, VA area. Maybe Mason 
Neck State Park, or maybe even on the grounds of Mt. Vernon, VA (beautiful place 
with picnic areas, shade, sun, waterfront, beautiful architecture, and much 
more)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So....now we need a location......let the 
LetterBoxers SPEAK......</div>

I heard from the G-Man and that weekend is out for him due to a <br/>
schedule conflict.  He stated that he'd have to be present at a <br/>
gathering for which he'd reserved The Grove at Quantico, so looks <br/>
like Quantico is not an option for this gathering.  <br/>
<br/>
I think either Leesylvania or Lake Anna State Park would be an <br/>
excellent location.  Wherever it takes place, I'll do my best to be <br/>
there.  Soccer season presents lots of weekend conflicts for me, but <br/>
it may work out.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>

ITA! There are five boxes at Lake Anna State Park, so in addition to <br/>
exchanging stamps and sharing carving tips, etc., we can letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, I would be happy to reserve a shelter at one of <br/>
Richmond, VA's many lovely area parks, several of which have boxes <br/>
already planted there. We could meet and greet and eat under the <br/>
shelter and then letterbox at either Pocahontas State Park (which <br/>
currently has four boxes), Bryan Park (which has one), or Rockwood <br/>
Park (which has one). And barring anything unforeseen, I will be <br/>
placing four boxes in Forest Hill Park any day now, so that might be <br/>
an option as well. (I finally finished carving the stamps!)<br/>

The mystery was the location of the boxes, not the location of the <br/>
clues. I guess finding the clues qualifies as a mystery, huh?<br/>
