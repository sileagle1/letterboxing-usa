                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am currently compiling a listing of as many letterboxing related <br/>
web resources  as I can locate (online articles, personal <br/>
letterboxing pages etc..). I would appreciate any help in locating as <br/>
many as possible. The purpose is for inclusion in a links section of <br/>
the new incarnation of my site "Letterboxing International". I am <br/>
also interested in any letterboxing related news, events, or personal <br/>
stories that folks would like to post. Links must be sent to me <br/>
directly, but anyone can post news, events, or stories directly to <br/>
the site. When you do post there is a slight delay before it appears <br/>
on the site because I need to screen out anything inappropriate (such <br/>
as spam or disclosure of clue information for boxes). Please contact <br/>
me directly if you know of web resources you would like included. If <br/>
you want to just check it out or post to the site, you can go to <br/>
http://www.letterboxing.com .<br/>
<br/>
At present the layout is complete but the content is just getting <br/>
started so it is pretty barren. Please send any questions or comments <br/>
_directly_ to me so as to not burden this list. Thanks much in <br/>
advance.<br/>

     Just got back from sunny Florida.  I'll drop off the postcard, but<br/>
wanted to let you know we found your letterbox at Myakka State Park.  It was<br/>
delightful to stamp in without freezing our fingers off!  Many thanks.  Wish<br/>
I'd had time to plant another there.  The park could definitely take a few<br/>
more, but we had a time crunch.  Thanks again for the letterbox "fix".<br/>
