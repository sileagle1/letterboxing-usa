It is no secret (now) that my boxes used to be listed online. They are<br/>
no longer online. I went to great lengths nearly a year ago to delete<br/>
them all and remove them from both AQ listings and teh massive LBNA<br/>
datababble. So, with that said, I had thought by saving my membership<br/>
and deleting the boxes one by one (painful for someone with 100+boxes)<br/>
that they would be removed once and for all. <br/>
<br/>
Apparently I (and some others) was wrong because if you do a quick<br/>
little search for "Unclaimed boxes" you'll find a nice little<br/>
compendium a la history of phyto boxes in Maine on the following list:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxFind.php and if that doesn't work, you<br/>
can surely figure out how to search by unclaimed boxes under "Placer". <br/>
<br/>
Not that it really matters now since the moxie boxes are defunct and<br/>
there is no clue associated with them, but it brings up a slight issue<br/>
I have with the way in which clues are currently numbered, catalogued<br/>
and listed online. This is a fantastic example of what happens when<br/>
you give up ownership of your clues and list them online.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else see the problem with this?<br/>

I am wondering how we would all find out about boxes if they weren't listed<br/>
online.  WOM only?  I can't imagine I would be able to get enough WOM clues<br/>
to keep me busy.  Published catalogs?<br/>
<br/>
So how do people find YOUR boxes now?<br/>
<br/>
Is the point of letterboxing to be a secret society? Complete with secret<br/>
handshakes?<br/>
<br/>
What is the reason you took your's offline?  Vandals?<br/>
<br/>
Just curious.<br/>

Good questions Mary.<br/>
Many new boxers in Maine or anywhere else for that matter have<br/>
absolutely no clue that there may be a[n old] box in the same area<br/>
five feet from a new one (PRESCOTT PARK CASE IN POINT) because the<br/>
clue is not listed online. I can see the issue with that, but at the<br/>
same time it seems to me as though there is a history to letterboxing<br/>
that pre-dates all the clues online. <br/>
<br/>
This is a very important concept that I think some people forget, the<br/>
fact that the folks that went before them established clues, boxes,<br/>
etc. For instance, Tom Cooch's original boxes in Maine - they were the<br/>
first listed boxes in Maine and still remain inspiration to myself and<br/>
many others. The folks that have inspired us to carve and plant are<br/>
few and far between, I can count them on one hand and I'm sure I don't<br/>
need to mention that Legerdemaine is one of them. I count myself very<br/>
lucky to have had those who went before me set a high standard for boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Are Cooch boxes (in Maine) listed online anylonger? Yes and no. Just<br/>
because a clue isn't listed anywhere online does not mean it isn't a<br/>
clue, or that it isn't available, or that you can't find it without a<br/>
bit of searching. Isn't this letterboxing after all? This poses the<br/>
real question - if a clue is written but nobody actually finds it - is<br/>
it still a clue? Or what about the box last weekend that we found, if<br/>
it isn't posted online and wasn't a box, but we found the stamp, is it<br/>
still a box?  Is a letterbox without a clue still a letterbox?<br/>
<br/>
That aside, if the clue is posted online without a real clue to link<br/>
it to then there is a problem. This is what has happened in my case,<br/>
the old clue listing was there, but the webpage where the clue was<br/>
listed - was defunct and therefore the clues were either 1) teaser<br/>
placeholders or 2) annoyances to folks looking and seeing the listing<br/>
with nothing there.<br/>
<br/>
And to answer your question about what my problem is with people<br/>
finding clues online and searching for my boxes? <br/>
<br/>
Well, that's more complex. I'd prefer to keep this post objective and<br/>
helpful to those who may have encountered this problem with my boxes<br/>
and say that the clues are no longer distributed online and that is my<br/>
preferred method. If you're interested in those sorts of boxes, then<br/>
I'm happy to hear it - if you're not, there are plenty of boxes listed<br/>
online for you to choose from.<br/>

Perhaps others don't want to pick up their toys and run home to play<br/>
with themselves.<br/>
<br/>
(*snerk* I said "play with themselves"...  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, tho - if you want this game to be just between you and your<br/>
friends, have at it - WOM only is fine for you.  It's kind of a shame<br/>
you feel that "old boxers" are leaving the game, saddened by the<br/>
terrible state it is now in, instead of maybe trying to improve it for<br/>
everyone.<br/>
<br/>
There really isn't a lot of older boxes in my area - I guess I don't<br/>
get to play if I don't live in New England, right?  And if I don't<br/>
happen to be friends with someone planting, well, too bad - I don't get<br/>
the clues, right?  <br/>
<br/>
I've gotten to the point where I'm planning my vacations to go to<br/>
places that have boxes planted, but I guess if everyone pulls their<br/>
on-line clues, I don't get to do that anymore, huh?<br/>
<br/>
I get as irritated as the next person when I find that one of my boxes<br/>
has been mistreated / not replaced properly / gone missing, but you<br/>
know what?  That's not going to prompt me to pull them.  It IS going to<br/>
make me try to find better hiding places, write better clues (still<br/>
working on this - clue writing is my weak point!), and always emphasize<br/>
within the clues the importance of being stealthy and unobserved while<br/>
hunting and proper rehide-ation.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone was a newbie at some point, even you.  Did you enjoy those<br/>
first boxes you found?  Did you ever hunt boxes using clues you got<br/>
on-line?  Judging from your AQ log, I think you may have...<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, one can't walk two steps off-trail in New England without<br/>
tripping on letterboxes.  I doubt greatly anyone will miss your boxes.<br/>
I hope you enjoy them, all by yourself.<br/>

<br/>
Since I've taken my boxes off LbNA and atlasquest and put them on my own<br/>
website, where, yes, they're out there on the internet but folks have to put<br/>
a little more work into finding them, I haven't had a single box go missing<br/>
in 2005.  So, as far as *my* missing boxes go, I can't attribute them to<br/>
muggles.  Because muggles would find my boxes whether they were on the<br/>
internet or not, since muggles find boxes accidentally.  Thus neither my<br/>
hiding techniques nor my clues were the problem.  Letterboxers were the<br/>
problem.<br/>

five feet from a new one (PRESCOTT PARK CASE IN POINT) because the<br/>
clue is not listed online. I can see the issue with that, but at the<br/>
same time it seems to me as though there is a history to letterboxing<br/>
that pre-dates all the clues online.<br/>
<br/>
This is a very important concept that I think some people forget, the<br/>
fact that the folks that went before them established clues, boxes,<br/>
etc. For instance, Tom Cooch's original boxes in Maine - they were the<br/>
first listed boxes in Maine and still remain inspiration to myself and<br/>
many others. The folks that have inspired us to carve and plant are<br/>
few and far between, I can count them on one hand and I'm sure I don't<br/>
need to mention that Legerdemaine is one of them. I count myself very<br/>
lucky to have had those who went before me set a high standard for boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Are Cooch boxes (in Maine) listed online anylonger? Yes and no. Just<br/>
because a clue isn't listed anywhere online does not mean it isn't a<br/>
clue, or that it isn't available, or that you can't find it without a<br/>
bit of searching. Isn't this letterboxing after all? This poses the<br/>
real question - if a clue is written but nobody actually finds it - is<br/>
it still a clue? Or what about the box last weekend that we found, if<br/>
it isn't posted online and wasn't a box, but we found the stamp, is it<br/>
still a box? Is a letterbox without a clue still a letterbox?<br/>
<br/>
That aside, if the clue is posted online without a real clue to link<br/>
it to then there is a problem. This is what has happened in my case,<br/>
the old clue listing was there, but the webpage where the clue was<br/>
listed - was defunct and therefore the clues were either 1) teaser<br/>
placeholders or 2) annoyances to folks looking and seeing the listing<br/>
with nothing there.<br/>
<br/>
And to answer your question about what my problem is with people<br/>
finding clues online and searching for my boxes?<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's more complex. I'd prefer to keep this post objective and<br/>
helpful to those who may have encountered this problem with my boxes<br/>
and say that the clues are no longer distributed online and that is my<br/>
preferred method. If you're interested in those sorts of boxes, then<br/>
I'm happy to hear it - if you're not, there are plenty of boxes listed<br/>
online for you to choose from.<br/>

&gt; with themselves.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (*snerk* I said "play with themselves"...  ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Seriously, tho - if you want this game to be just between you and your<br/>
&gt; friends, have at it - WOM only is fine for you.  It's kind of a shame<br/>
&gt; you feel that "old boxers" are leaving the game, saddened by the<br/>
&gt; terrible state it is now in, instead of maybe trying to improve it for<br/>
&gt; everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There really isn't a lot of older boxes in my area - I guess I don't<br/>
&gt; get to play if I don't live in New England, right?  And if I don't<br/>
&gt; happen to be friends with someone planting, well, too bad - I don't<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; the clues, right?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I've gotten to the point where I'm planning my vacations to go to<br/>
&gt; places that have boxes planted, but I guess if everyone pulls their<br/>
&gt; on-line clues, I don't get to do that anymore, huh?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I get as irritated as the next person when I find that one of my boxes<br/>
&gt; has been mistreated / not replaced properly / gone missing, but you<br/>
&gt; know what?  That's not going to prompt me to pull them.  It IS going<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; make me try to find better hiding places, write better clues (still<br/>
&gt; working on this - clue writing is my weak point!), and always<br/>
emphasize<br/>
&gt; within the clues the importance of being stealthy and unobserved while<br/>
&gt; hunting and proper rehide-ation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Everyone was a newbie at some point, even you.  Did you enjoy those<br/>
&gt; first boxes you found?  Did you ever hunt boxes using clues you got<br/>
&gt; on-line?  Judging from your AQ log, I think you may have...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Apparently, one can't walk two steps off-trail in New England without<br/>
&gt; tripping on letterboxes.  I doubt greatly anyone will miss your boxes.<br/>
&gt; I hope you enjoy them, all by yourself.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Bad analogy David because you're not taking it far enough.  I can't say<br/>
whether you're part of the problem or not.  I've never letterboxed with you,<br/>
so how would I know?  I've come directly behind some pretty "seasoned"<br/>
letterboxers in this area, and have found some of the more seasoned folks to<br/>
be no more respectful than some of the new boxers.<br/>
<br/>
You might have felt I was talking about you specifically being a bad boxer<br/>
because I mentioned that Phyto might not miss having your stamp in their box<br/>
logbooks and that, by that, I was saying you were a boxer who was<br/>
disrespectful of boxes when out in the field.  Nope.  But first let's take<br/>
your analogy.<br/>
<br/>
A more complete analogy might be:<br/>
<br/>
Say I were to put out some well-hidden cat food.  But there were also other<br/>
cats (other letterboxers) in the neighborhood and also some squirrels<br/>
(muggles).  And my cat lets his fellow cats know where the food was but<br/>
nobody tells the squirrels.   Every so often the food bowl is turned upside<br/>
down and the food ruined.  Who did it?  Squirrel or cat?  Who knows?  It<br/>
could have been either.  The food may have been hidden in MY mind but I have<br/>
have inadvertently placed it right along a path that squirrels take<br/>
everyday.  I didn't plant at camcorder at the site, so I have no way of<br/>
knowing.<br/>
<br/>
Here's where ya have to go a little farther -- Say instead of allowing my<br/>
cat to tell his catbuddies, I instead took a bowl of cat food and tell my<br/>
cat that, for the time being at least, he's not to tell anyone, not even his<br/>
catbuddies, that the food is there.  I tell my cat that this is going to be<br/>
a little experiment. I hide the food in exactly the same place so that takes<br/>
the placement of the food out of the equation as far as variables go.  And<br/>
lo and behold, a year goes by and there are absolutely NO overturned food<br/>
dishes.  Now, to me, this rather suggests that the food bowl was NOT hidden<br/>
along a common squirrel path and was not being found accidentally by<br/>
squirrels.  Since if the squirrels were the ones finding it in the first<br/>
place, then they'd still be finding it, no?<br/>
<br/>
What I meant by my statement was that you're just another person attempting<br/>
to "play" what I call the "Dismay Card."  In other words, when Boxer A<br/>
decides to play the game a bit differently from how Boxer B would like them<br/>
to play it, Boxer B seems to think that by suddenly proclaiming that this<br/>
will then cause a problem for them, Boxer B, that Boxer A will immediately<br/>
become dismayed by that fact, fall into a deep depression over it, and<br/>
immediately seek to rectify the situation to Boxer B's satisfaction.  But<br/>
there are a lot of Boxer As out there who don't care if Boxer B becomes<br/>
upset or not.  What it tells me is that some of the Boxer Bs have a rather<br/>
inflated opinion of themselves by expecting the Boxer As to be dismayed,<br/>
overwrought, severely depressed.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
There are no facts to "get" unfortunately.  There is no huge U.S. lost<br/>
letterbox database that will tell us exactly why all the letterboxes have<br/>
gone missing or been damaged that have gone missing or been damaged.  So I<br/>
can't "GET SOME FACTS!" as you say, and neither can you.<br/>
<br/>
I was speaking for my letterboxes, based on what I've personally found this<br/>
year, and was thinking that just possibly letterboxers are more to blame<br/>
than other letterboxers commonly want to blame them.  That's all.  Like I<br/>
said, "I have a sneaky hunch."<br/>
<br/>
When I had my boxes on LbNA and atlasquest and when Pippi and Keith had<br/>
theirs on LbNA and atlasquest, there was a fair amount of either damaged or<br/>
missing boxes.  Other placers in this area have had very similar problems.<br/>
And there was no way of knowing why.  But I DID know that neither squirrels<br/>
nor muggles read LbNA or atlasquest.  And when the boxes were replaced back<br/>
into the same places and the clues were kept a little more quiet, there's<br/>
been no missing or damaged boxes.  For 3/4 of a year now.  So muggles were<br/>
not finding the boxes accidentally because they'd still be finding them<br/>
accidentally no matter where I placed the clues, since muggles weren't using<br/>
the clues anyway.<br/>
<br/>
On our regional letterboxing discussion group, generally when I post I put<br/>
my website under my signature.  If someone gets curious and checks it out,<br/>
they'll find my letterbox clues.  Or sometimes a letterboxer will email me,<br/>
asking where they might find my clues.  Or sometimes a letterboxer will come<br/>
across my blog on blogger.com and my blog gives the url for my website.<br/>
Silent Doug's site also has a link to my little website.  My clues are out<br/>
there.  It's just not quite as easy to find them.  Do I miss not having tons<br/>
and tons of stamps in the logbooks?  It'd be the same as saying do I miss<br/>
not having to recarve stamps and replace boxes?  Nope.  I don't miss it at<br/>
all.<br/>

placeholders or 2) annoyances to folks looking and seeing the listing<br/>
with nothing there.<br/>
<br/>
And to answer your question about what my problem is with people<br/>
finding clues online and searching for my boxes?<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's more complex. I'd prefer to keep this post objective and<br/>
helpful to those who may have encountered this problem with my boxes<br/>
and say that the clues are no longer distributed online and that is my<br/>
preferred method. If you're interested in those sorts of boxes, then<br/>
I'm happy to hear it - if you're not, there are plenty of boxes listed<br/>
online for you to choose from.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's totally fair because it's how each placer has chosen to handle their<br/>
boxes.  If a placer lists boxes on LbNA or atlasquest, they've *chosen* to<br/>
put those boxes out there for the entire world.<br/>
<br/>
If we're going to play tit for tat, then why don't we include other things<br/>
as well?  For example, if a person has found a box, they should have to<br/>
immediately place a box so that it could be found by the placer of the box<br/>
they just found.  If a person finds 8000 boxes, they should have placed 8000<br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, it's not "fair", right?<br/>
<br/>
Why should somebody, say, get to find 2000 boxes if they've only put the<br/>
work into placing 10?  There are a ton of folks who find boxes but who plant<br/>
NO boxes.  Should a finder have to be a card carrying member of Letterbox<br/>
Planters of America in order to be able to find boxes?  Or should we say,<br/>
OK, you can find maybe 5 or 6 boxes, but after that you're banned from<br/>
finding any more boxes unless you start plant boxes?<br/>
<br/>
Another tit for tat:  If somebody finds drive-by boxes, are they then<br/>
obligated to place drive-by boxes?  Their preference might be to take people<br/>
on long hikes to beautiful scenery, but, by your definition, for any<br/>
drive-by boxes they found, they'd also have to plant drive-by boxes<br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Or the reverse.  If someone chooses to plant drive-by boxes because they're<br/>
easy for them to get to and maintain, then if they take a nice long camping<br/>
and hiking vacation, they can't plan their trip around finding any boxes out<br/>
on that trip that might require long hikes because they didn't plant any<br/>
such boxes themselves.  So what right do they have to go finding any boxes<br/>
that may require a 3 mile hike?<br/>
<br/>
Oooooooooh, and how about pens or inkpads?  If a person finds a box with a<br/>
pen or inkpad, but doesn't place pens or inkpads in the boxes they've<br/>
placed, then it's no fair that they use the pen or inkpad that's in that box<br/>
they just found, right?  In the immortal words of Andy Taylor, that would be<br/>
"bad bad baaaaaaaaaaaaad", right?<br/>
<br/>
And what about First Finder certificates and prizes?  Some folks put them in<br/>
their boxes, some don't.  But if a person chooses not to use those with<br/>
their boxes, then they'd better not take them from any boxes they might be<br/>
the First Finder of, right?  If they're the First Finder, they should just<br/>
pack that box back on up and come back another day to refind it since they<br/>
have to wait until a First Finder finds it who DOES give out First Finder<br/>
certificates and prizes in their boxes.<br/>
<br/>
The tit for tat game could get kind of ridiculous dontcha think?<br/>

&gt; you feel that "old boxers" are leaving the game, saddened by the<br/>
&gt; terrible state it is now in, instead of maybe trying to improve it for<br/>
&gt; everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There really isn't a lot of older boxes in my area - I guess I don't<br/>

&gt; happen to be friends with someone planting, well, too bad - I don't<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; the clues, right?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I've gotten to the point where I'm planning my vacations to go to<br/>
&gt; places that have boxes planted, but I guess if everyone pulls their<br/>
&gt; on-line clues, I don't get to do that anymore, huh?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I get as irritated as the next person when I find that one of my boxes<br/>
&gt; has been mistreated / not replaced properly / gone missing, but you<br/>
&gt; know what?  That's not going to prompt me to pull them.  It IS going<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; make me try to find better hiding places, write better clues (still<br/>
&gt; working on this - clue writing is my weak point!), and always<br/>
emphasize<br/>
&gt; within the clues the importance of being stealthy and unobserved while<br/>
&gt; hunting and proper rehide-ation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Everyone was a newbie at some point, even you.  Did you enjoy those<br/>
&gt; first boxes you found?  Did you ever hunt boxes using clues you got<br/>
&gt; on-line?  Judging from your AQ log, I think you may have...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Apparently, one can't walk two steps off-trail in New England without<br/>

          Bad analogy David because you're not taking it far enough. I can't say<br/>
whether you're part of the problem or not. I've never letterboxed with you,<br/>
so how would I know? I've come directly behind some pretty "seasoned"<br/>
letterboxers in this area, and have found some of the more seasoned folks to<br/>
be no more respectful than some of the new boxers.<br/>
<br/>
You might have felt I was talking about you specifically being a bad boxer<br/>
because I mentioned that Phyto might not miss having your stamp in their box<br/>
logbooks and that, by that, I was saying you were a boxer who was<br/>
disrespectful of boxes when out in the field. Nope. But first let's take<br/>
your analogy.<br/>
<br/>
A more complete analogy might be:<br/>
<br/>
Say I were to put out some well-hidden cat food. But there were also other<br/>
cats (other letterboxers) in the neighborhood and also some squirrels<br/>
(muggles). And my cat lets his fellow cats know where the food was but<br/>
nobody tells the squirrels. Every so often the food bowl is turned upside<br/>
down and the food ruined. Who did it? Squirrel or cat? Who knows? It<br/>
could have been either. The food may have been hidden in MY mind but I have<br/>
have inadvertently placed it right along a path that squirrels take<br/>
everyday. I didn't plant at camcorder at the site, so I have no way of<br/>
knowing.<br/>
<br/>
Here's where ya have to go a little farther -- Say instead of allowing my<br/>
cat to tell his catbuddies, I instead took a bowl of cat food and tell my<br/>
cat that, for the time being at least, he's not to tell anyone, not even his<br/>
catbuddies, that the food is there. I tell my cat that this is going to be<br/>
a little experiment. I hide the food in exactly the same place so that takes<br/>
the placement of the food out of the equation as far as variables go. And<br/>
lo and behold, a year goes by and there are absolutely NO overturned food<br/>
dishes. Now, to me, this rather suggests that the food bowl was NOT hidden<br/>
along a common squirrel path and was not being found accidentally by<br/>
squirrels. Since if the squirrels were the ones finding it in the first<br/>
place, then they'd still be finding it, no?<br/>
<br/>
What I meant by my statement was that you're just another person attempting<br/>
to "play" what I call the "Dismay Card." In other words, when Boxer A<br/>
decides to play the game a bit differently from how Boxer B would like them<br/>
to play it, Boxer B seems to think that by suddenly proclaiming that this<br/>
will then cause a problem for them, Boxer B, that Boxer A will immediately<br/>
become dismayed by that fact, fall into a deep depression over it, and<br/>
immediately seek to rectify the situation to Boxer B's satisfaction. But<br/>
there are a lot of Boxer As out there who don't care if Boxer B becomes<br/>
upset or not. What it tells me is that some of the Boxer Bs have a rather<br/>
inflated opinion of themselves by expecting the Boxer As to be dismayed,<br/>
overwrought, severely depressed. :-)<br/>
<br/>
There are no facts to "get" unfortunately. There is no huge U.S. lost<br/>
letterbox database that will tell us exactly why all the letterboxes have<br/>
gone missing or been damaged that have gone missing or been damaged. So I<br/>
can't "GET SOME FACTS!" as you say, and neither can you.<br/>
<br/>
I was speaking for my letterboxes, based on what I've personally found this<br/>
year, and was thinking that just possibly letterboxers are more to blame<br/>
than other letterboxers commonly want to blame them. That's all. Like I<br/>
said, "I have a sneaky hunch."<br/>
<br/>
When I had my boxes on LbNA and atlasquest and when Pippi and Keith had<br/>
theirs on LbNA and atlasquest, there was a fair amount of either damaged or<br/>
missing boxes. Other placers in this area have had very similar problems.<br/>
And there was no way of knowing why. But I DID know that neither squirrels<br/>
nor muggles read LbNA or atlasquest. And when the boxes were replaced back<br/>
into the same places and the clues were kept a little more quiet, there's<br/>
been no missing or damaged boxes. For 3/4 of a year now. So muggles were<br/>
not finding the boxes accidentally because they'd still be finding them<br/>
accidentally no matter where I placed the clues, since muggles weren't using<br/>
the clues anyway.<br/>
<br/>
On our regional letterboxing discussion group, generally when I post I put<br/>
my website under my signature. If someone gets curious and checks it out,<br/>
they'll find my letterbox clues. Or sometimes a letterboxer will email me,<br/>
asking where they might find my clues. Or sometimes a letterboxer will come<br/>
across my blog on blogger.com and my blog gives the url for my website.<br/>
Silent Doug's site also has a link to my little website. My clues are out<br/>
there. It's just not quite as easy to find them. Do I miss not having tons<br/>
and tons of stamps in the logbooks? It'd be the same as saying do I miss<br/>
not having to recarve stamps and replace boxes? Nope. I don't miss it at<br/>
all.<br/>

sounds like you think i am part of the problem!<br/>
do yourself a favor, before you go blaming letterboxers for you problems,<br/>
GET SOME FACTS! out of 68 boxes, i have lost 3. 1 to animals and 2 have been<br/>
pulled due to vandalism. WOW! i don't blame letterboxers for these problems.<br/>
<br/>
so you go to feed your cat and it doesn't eat the food. a squirrel comes<br/>
along and eats all the food. do you blame the cat?<br/>

the internet is a big place, and you can get lost easily. have fun doing<br/>

<br/>
Since I've taken my boxes off LbNA and atlasquest and put them on my own<br/>
website, where, yes, they're out there on the internet but folks have to put<br/>
a little more work into finding them, I haven't had a single box go missing<br/>
in 2005. So, as far as *my* missing boxes go, I can't attribute them to<br/>
muggles. Because muggles would find my boxes whether they were on the<br/>
internet or not, since muggles find boxes accidentally. Thus neither my<br/>
hiding techniques nor my clues were the problem. Letterboxers were the<br/>
problem.<br/>

&gt; How, exactly, do new folk find any boxes if no one lists them on-line?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; What was the problem with people knowing your clues and searching<br/>
&gt; for your boxes?<br/>
<br/>
Good questions Mary.<br/>
Many new boxers in Maine or anywhere else for that matter have<br/>
absolutely no clue that there may be a[n old] box in the same area<br/>
five feet from a new one (PRESCOTT PARK CASE IN POINT) because the<br/>
clue is not listed online. I can see the issue with that, but at the<br/>
same time it seems to me as though there is a history to letterboxing<br/>
that pre-dates all the clues online.<br/>
<br/>
This is a very important concept that I think some people forget, the<br/>
fact that the folks that went before them established clues, boxes,<br/>
etc. For instance, Tom Cooch's original boxes in Maine - they were the<br/>
first listed boxes in Maine and still remain inspiration to myself and<br/>
many others. The folks that have inspired us to carve and plant are<br/>
few and far between, I can count them on one hand and I'm sure I don't<br/>
need to mention that Legerdemaine is one of them. I count myself very<br/>
lucky to have had those who went before me set a high standard for boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Are Cooch boxes (in Maine) listed online anylonger? Yes and no. Just<br/>
because a clue isn't listed anywhere online does not mean it isn't a<br/>
clue, or that it isn't available, or that you can't find it without a<br/>
bit of searching. Isn't this letterboxing after all? This poses the<br/>
real question - if a clue is written but nobody actually finds it - is<br/>
it still a clue? Or what about the box last weekend that we found, if<br/>
it isn't posted online and wasn't a box, but we found the stamp, is it<br/>
still a box? Is a letterbox without a clue still a letterbox?<br/>
<br/>
That aside, if the clue is posted online without a real clue to link<br/>
it to then there is a problem. This is what has happened in my case,<br/>
the old clue listing was there, but the webpage where the clue was<br/>
listed - was defunct and therefore the clues were either 1) teaser<br/>
placeholders or 2) annoyances to folks looking and seeing the listing<br/>

<br/>
And to answer your question about what my problem is with people<br/>
finding clues online and searching for my boxes?<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's more complex. I'd prefer to keep this post objective and<br/>
helpful to those who may have encountered this problem with my boxes<br/>
and say that the clues are no longer distributed online and that is my<br/>
preferred method. If you're interested in those sorts of boxes, then<br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">The same as I told rozebud, it's a question of priorities.  I don't have the<br/>
time to recarve stamps and replace boxes.  Or, I should say, I don't<br/>
*choose* to have the time.  The same as Roze doesn't have the time to hit<br/>
the internet in search of boxes other than on the two major sites.  Roze has<br/>
the time.  It's just not how Roze *chooses* to use Roze's time.  I have<br/>
other things I prefer to do with the time I can give to letterboxing.  Just<br/>
because my priorities aren't the same as yours or aren't the same as Roze's<br/>
doesn't make my priorities any less valid.<br/>
<br/>
If people do find the website and do harm the boxes, then they find the<br/>
website and harm the boxes.  But so far, so good.  The people who *have*<br/>
taken the time to find my clues have been great about the handling of the<br/>
boxes.  I have no complaints to date.  2005 has been a much better year than<br/>
2004 or 2003.  As long as it's working, why should I change it?<br/>
<br/>
And I wouldn't say I have "high standards" at all.  I'd say I have very<br/>
normal "standards."<br/>
<br/>
Is it a high standard to expect folks to seal the baggies after they're<br/>
finished and they're packing everything up?<br/>
<br/>
Is it a high standard to expect folks to put tops tightly back on boxes, and<br/>
make sure those tops are rightside up?<br/>
<br/>
Is it a high standard to expect folks to rehide the box so that it can't<br/>
been seen by someone passing by?<br/>
<br/>
Is it a high standard to expect folks to double-bag the logbook if I state<br/>
in the clues that I'd really appreciate it if they did so and I<br/>
double-bagged the logbook in the first place, so it's not like the baggies<br/>
aren't there to use to do it?<br/>
<br/>
Is it a high standard to expect folks not to scream and shout "I FOUND IT! I<br/>
FOUND IT!" if they find a letterbox while muggles are in the near vicinity<br/>
and will wonder just what the heck is going on and might want to go check it<br/>
out after the letterboxers have left?<br/>
<br/>
I think those are pretty normal standards.  I don't think I'm setting the<br/>
bar very high at all.  If those are "high standards" to you, then you seem<br/>
to be saying the letterboxers in general in this country are a pretty<br/>
mediocre lot.  If those are "high standards" then I guess I'm happy having<br/>
high standards.<br/>
<br/>
No, David, frankly I'm not out to "know many other letterboxers."  I began<br/>
letterboxing because I love stamps, I love art, I love to carve even tho I'm<br/>
not too good at it, and the walks and hikes are an absolutely fantastic<br/>
stress reducer (which is why I rarely do drive-by boxes -- nothing wrong<br/>
with drive-bys but for health reasons I prefer the longer hikes).  I do<br/>
probably 95 percent of my boxing alone, if not 99 percent.  That's how I<br/>
want it.  If I find a great spot, I can stop and do some meditation, stop<br/>
and do some yoga, stop and do some birdwatching, stop and take a swim in the<br/>
quarry, etc.  In other words, I can "mosey" (hence my trail name).<br/>
<br/>
For the most part, letterboxing is not a social activity for me.  I'm a<br/>
union official and a good part of my job these last two years or so has been<br/>
putting together cases for either arbitration hearings or court dates.<br/>
Every so often I actually get to go back and deliver some mail, but that's<br/>
becoming pretty rare these days.  A lot of what I do is high stress and I<br/>
love the letterboxing to reduce that stress.   I recently had a bout of<br/>
tests and stuff run to see what shape my cardiovascular system is in because<br/>
my internist was concerned because of the stress I'm usually under.<br/>
Cardiologist told me when we were finally all finished that the heart in<br/>
this 55 year old body is as good as or better than the hearts in most 20<br/>
year old bodies.  I owe a huge thanks to letterboxing for that.  I certainly<br/>
don't owe it to the M&amp;Ms that are my major food group.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I also kind of *like* not being able to put many names with faces.  For some<br/>
folks, they love to put names to faces.  And that's great.  That's what they<br/>
like to do.  I like the mystery of *not* necessarily knowing who someone is.<br/>
We had a finder around here by the trailname of "Midnight Visitor" who, for<br/>
the better part of a couple of years, was the first finder on practically<br/>
every box planted in this area.  I don't know if anybody knows who this<br/>
person was.  They planted one box, were the first finder or close to it for<br/>
all the boxes planted for a couple of years, and now he/she seems to have<br/>
completely disappeared.  (Unless they've moved and are now active in another<br/>
part of the country.)  I try to keep an eye on the one box they planted<br/>
because it's a great box and I don't know if they're still active or not.  I<br/>
certainly wouldn't change anything about the box, that's definitely not my<br/>
place to do that, but if the baggies get worn out or the box doesn't get<br/>
replaced in the right spot, I check out the box every so often and fix it.<br/>
And I like the mystery of having absolutely no idea who this person is/was.<br/>
If I passed 'em on the street, I wouldn't know them and they wouldn't know<br/>
me.  I'm fine with that.<br/>
<br/>
I don't "hate" anybody.  "Hate" is an awfully strong word.  But then in<br/>
another post of yours you mention your ex-wife in a way that tells me that<br/>
"hate" might possibly be a well-used member of your vocabulary.  I hope not.<br/>
But it's not in mine.  Much as I seriously dislike the guy, I don't even<br/>
"hate" George Bush. And I can't think of anybody I dislike more than Bush<br/>
right now.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
As far as your Walmart comment, like I said, the way I'm doing it has worked<br/>
for me this year.  So I'm fine with it.  I'm sure that Walmart uses the<br/>
techniques and practices that work for *them*.  I can't imagine Walmart<br/>
doing much of anything that didn't work for them.  :-) And if you truly<br/>
*aren't* upset or throwing any sort of temper tantrum, if you truly are<br/>
totally 100 percent happy with all the boxes you're finding that are listed<br/>
on LbNA and atlasquest, I can't see what your problem is with how either<br/>
phyto or me, or anyone else for that matter, lists their boxes.  If you're<br/>
happy as a "bug in a rug" as you say in another post, then why the sniping?<br/>
I would think you'd be totally willing to live and let live, make the<br/>
choices that work for you, and allow other folks to make the choices that<br/>
work for *them*.<br/>

If it was animals or if it was muggles, it would still be happening because<br/>
it wouldn't matter WHERE I posted the clues for animals or muggles to cause<br/>
a problem. It has not happened ONCE this year since I changed my system.<br/>
Nine months I've gone so far with no boxes missing or damaged.  Yet the only<br/>
thing that's changed is where I post the clues.  The location of the boxes<br/>
hasn't changed.  The clues themselves haven't changed.  Nothing has changed<br/>
except where I post the clues.  I don't know how much simpler I can put it.<br/>

I should have just kept it to myself?  I see.  Now you're not only<br/>
attempting to make rules on where a placer should post their clues but also<br/>
what a person can or can't say in a post to the list?<br/>

And why would I have contacted John or Ryan?  It's certainly not their<br/>

          David, how many times do I have to tell ya? None of my boxes have gone<br/>
missing or have been damaged since I changed where I post the clues. How<br/>
much more evidence do you need to tell you that it was very very likely<br/>
neither muggles nor animals that were damaging the boxes or causing the<br/>
boxes to go missing.<br/>
<br/>
If it was animals or if it was muggles, it would still be happening because<br/>
it wouldn't matter WHERE I posted the clues for animals or muggles to cause<br/>
a problem. It has not happened ONCE this year since I changed my system.<br/>
Nine months I've gone so far with no boxes missing or damaged. Yet the only<br/>
thing that's changed is where I post the clues. The location of the boxes<br/>
hasn't changed. The clues themselves haven't changed. Nothing has changed<br/>
except where I post the clues. I don't know how much simpler I can put it.<br/>
<br/>
I should have just kept it to myself? I see. Now you're not only<br/>
attempting to make rules on where a placer should post their clues but also<br/>
what a person can or can't say in a post to the list?<br/>
<br/>
And why would I have contacted John or Ryan? It's certainly not their<br/>
problem. I didn't even originate the thread. I was simply responding to<br/>
replies you made to the original poster. Replies that I felt were off-base.<br/>

i just dont understand why you would change something when you had no proof<br/>
that letterboxers were the cause of your boxes going missing.<br/>
<br/>
your gonna do it your way anyway. the reason i care about what your doing,<br/>
is the way in which you did it. you need proof before blaming other<br/>
letterboxers. you should have just kept it to your self.<br/>
<br/>
i already said to much after saying i am done. new topic please.<br/>
maybe you should have just contacted john or ryan about it.<br/>
<br/>
you have fun your way and i'll have fun mine!<br/>

delete?]<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Hi folks<br/>
&gt;   It is no secret (now) that my boxes used to be listed online. They are<br/>
&gt;   no longer online. I went to great lengths nearly a year ago to delete<br/>
&gt;   them all and remove them from both AQ listings and teh massive LBNA<br/>
&gt;   datababble. So, with that said, I had thought by saving my membership<br/>
&gt;   and deleting the boxes one by one (painful for someone with 100+boxes)<br/>
&gt;   that they would be removed once and for all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Apparently I (and some others) was wrong because if you do a quick<br/>
&gt;   little search for "Unclaimed boxes" you'll find a nice little<br/>
&gt;   compendium a la history of phyto boxes in Maine on the following list:<br/>
&gt;   http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxFind.php and if that doesn't work, you<br/>
&gt;   can surely figure out how to search by unclaimed boxes under "Placer".<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Not that it really matters now since the moxie boxes are defunct and<br/>
&gt;   there is no clue associated with them, but it brings up a slight issue<br/>
&gt;   I have with the way in which clues are currently numbered, catalogued<br/>
&gt;   and listed online. This is a fantastic example of what happens when<br/>
&gt;   you give up ownership of your clues and list them online.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Does anyone else see the problem with this?<br/>
&gt;   Really, it's too bad that others can't realize that listing clues<br/>
&gt;   online is a poor way to go.<br/>
