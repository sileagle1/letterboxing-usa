                    <div class="plaintext-content">GREAT!  I've been waiting and waiting and waiting to hear that someone <br/>
found Juliette...though, ESAK visited the box once but this was before <br/>
we placed Juliette there.  After so many months and not attracting any <br/>
visitors, we've decided to place at least one more box on earlier on <br/>
the trail...this will happen this weekend, most likely, just carved <br/>
it last night.<br/>
<br/>
Bruce and I are very impressed...it is a long, hard hike. I take it <br/>
you weren't followed up that last incline by a black dog?<br/>
