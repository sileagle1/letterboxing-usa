<br/>
http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/llama.php<br/>
<br/>
and decided to use part of it as a clue when we want to have a clandestine <br/>
meeting!  Perhaps others here might like it also!<br/>
<br/>
There is a part in the song that asks:<br/>
<br/>
"Is it made of lemonjuice?"<br/>
<br/>
To which the other replies the next line from the song:<br/>
<br/>
"Doorknob.  Ankle.  Cold."<br/>
<br/>
Very  Max and Agent 99, Silly, and fun and who else out on the trail is <br/>
possibly going to think to reply that way?<br/>
