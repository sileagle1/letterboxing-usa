<br/>
I am finally writing as I promised I would at the DC Gathering. Due <br/>
to the freezing temps, it has been a tough couple of weeks for boxing <br/>
activities in the Northeast! <br/>
<br/>
First, I would like to thank Coleen for organizing an amazing <br/>
gathering at Clyde's. I'm sorry I couldn't have attended sooner, but <br/>
I was invited to brunch with my brother, sister-in-law, and 3-year-<br/>
old niece in Reisterstown.  Since it has been about ten years since <br/>
my last visit to the Columbia Mall, I was amazed to see how much the <br/>
area had grown. It was nice to revisit an area where I spent four <br/>
memorable years of my life. <br/>
<br/>
I was especially impressed with the positive energy at this <br/>
gathering. Now that I have attended events in both the northeast and <br/>
the mid-Atlantic, we will have to find a way to connect the two <br/>
groups during the summer. The personalities, stories, and creativity <br/>
would blend together like a masterful symphony! <br/>
<br/>
I cannot wait to return to Maryland in the Spring! I would love to <br/>
go `boxing with any of the terrific people I met on Saturday!<br/>
<br/>
Northeasterners..You have got to see the logbooks the mid-Atlantic <br/>
boxers have created! :-) Also, if you see me on the trail, you have <br/>
to check out some of the fine stamp work I collected along the way!!! <br/>
<br/>
The weekend after the gathering, I made my way to Rockport, MA to <br/>
visit a good friend who is moving to Taiwan next week. We attempted <br/>
the Eastern Point Light box, but the wind chill was just too much! I <br/>
was successful in finding Castle of Love, and Salem Witch Trials. <br/>
<br/>
If you would like to respond, please contact me off-list.  I do not <br/>
subscribe to the daily e-mail service and I will only occasionally <br/>
check the list. <br/>
<br/>
Once again, thanks for a terrific time!<br/>
<br/>
Darrin  I used to be called dangerous, however, someone just <br/>
informed me that I have been irreverently labeled "The Spy!" :-) Will <br/>
it stick????<br/>
<br/>
F  Many beautiful stamps and new favorite places<br/>
P  A few (will post soon)<br/>
X  with some wonderful people!<br/>
HH  Always a pleasant surprise<br/>
