We had our new baby "Lil'e" out at 9 days old - she slept through the<br/>
whole thing! It was almost a drive by, though - just a five minute<br/>
walk from the car. I thought it was more of an accomplishment that I<br/>
made it out for the letterbox! Sounds terrible, but it was on New<br/>
Year's Day (it was in the low 60's though, unusual for NJ!) and she<br/>
was bundled up tight!<br/>
<br/>
Congrats to you and Teapot and to Donna and Darrin on your new bundle<br/>
of joy!!<br/>
<br/>

How about this?  Find the <br/>
most beautiful, remote <br/>
letterbox area, bring your <br/>
family, midwife or doctor <br/>
and birth your baby right <br/>
there!  After cleaning them <br/>
up , you can use their <br/>
little feet and hands for <br/>
the stamps.  You have to ink <br/>
their hands and feet for the <br/>
official records anyhow!<br/>
