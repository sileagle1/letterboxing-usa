     What a gorgeous series of stamps and such a thoughtful, <br/>
appropos poem, too!  Thanks, Candlelight, for such a nice <br/>
letterboxing experience in a great park!!!  This is one of those <br/>
parks I might never have visited had it not been for <br/>
letterboxing!!!  Don't miss these stamps if you're in the area.  <br/>
     If you happen to visit during rainy weather, I recommend good <br/>
waterproof rain/muck boots for your adventure as the route got a bit <br/>
sloppy/mucky along the way.  My daughter absolutely LOVED it--<br/>
nothing like puddles to satisfy an adventurous 4 year old!!!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails...<br/>

Yippee is right!  Good going girl!  You inspire me!  Keep on <br/>
running and dont look back.  The Nail Family will be behind you <br/>
all the way-------just quite a few steps back, thats all.  Honestly, I <br/>
wish I had the time to collect 200 stamps in less than 6 months!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is a numbers game and its a good game to play too <br/>
(despite the arguments against the stats aspect) because you <br/>
only play against yourself. The more numbers you get the more <br/>
fun you have personally, the more boxes you visit to the delight of <br/>
the boxes' creators, the more people you encourage to get into <br/>
the sport, the more people you inspire to get out there and do <br/>
more boxing too----everybody wins! And besides, almost 2/3 of <br/>
the boxes the Nail Family has visited have been placed by <br/>
dvn2rckr and fam.  Thanks for putting up those numbers <br/>
especially.<br/>
