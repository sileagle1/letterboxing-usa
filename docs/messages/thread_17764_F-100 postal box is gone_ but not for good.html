If anyone is on the list and has moved in the past year or no longer wants to be on the list, just let me know.<br/>

  Well, it seems that the F-100 box is gone. I know who mailed it out prior to Christmas and who did not get it (that should have), so I will be carving a replica that will be sent to the place it was supposed to visit before going missing. This is an example of why the 'delivery confirmation' is such a good idea &amp; it doesn't cost much. Having that number of the package allows the post office to see where it is/went. I have no control over how the postal boxes are mailed once they leave my home, but I do request that anyone sending off a box of my creation gets a delivery confirmation (&amp; I'll do the same for any boxes I pass along). Look for this box to start it's rounds again soon!<br/>
