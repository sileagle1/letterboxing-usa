                    <html><body>Hi All!
<br/>
<br/>Thanks for the wonderful day. Christopher and I were so very pleased that so many people came. After tallying our logs and the event book, we calculate that 64 people came!!
<br/>
<br/>Thanks to Warrior Woman and Butterfly for their in-house mystery boxes "Thumbthing for Everyone" and "Kiss Kiss". Happy Birthday wishes to Butterfly who had a bit of a surprise with a gift of clues to a birthday box and a yummy cake, to the resounding chorus of ''Happy Birthday to You" by all who attended.
<br/>
<br/>Thanks also to Jay Drew who came extra early to plant a new permanent box, the "Billings Barn" box. Jay and the rest of the CT crew (Musicwoman, Butterfly, Lobsta Lady, Bluebird and Letterboxer2002) showed up early to 'box' and helped set up the tables and chairs. Many thanks for that!
<br/>
<br/>We are VERY jealous that Alan (Letterboxer 2002) is going to Dartmoor. All I can say is you better take a lot of pictures! Wishing you lots of new boxes.
<br/>
<br/>Thanks for all the exchanges and the hitchhikers that passes thru. We were fortunate to acquire the Woody Hitchhiker, which we will make sure finds a good spot.
<br/>
<br/>Thanks finally to all for being just about as fastidious at cleaning up as you are at rehiding boxes.Talk about "Leave no Trace". All I had to do was empty the trash barrels and tidy the chairs. That made our day.
<br/>
<br/>We hope to see everyone again at the April CT work day gathering and I know there was talk of a Cape Cod event too.
<br/>
<br/>Thanks again for your wonderful company!
<br/>
<br/>Cheers!
<br/>Kim (Rustypuff) and Christopher (CSCM)
