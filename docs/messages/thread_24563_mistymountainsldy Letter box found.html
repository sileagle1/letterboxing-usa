  My wife and I had no idea what a letter box was until we found one <br/>
on a trail here in Georgia last week end. There was a message left by <br/>
some well.... Not very inteligent people that said "We found this box <br/>
and thought we had to have a stamp and we took the box. Sorry we ara <br/>
just now returning it." ONE YEAR LATER! The box was from <br/>
mistymountainsldy and it was about her mother Lynn who had passed from <br/>
Cancer. Her Yahoo address is nolonger valid and I just wanted her to <br/>
know that it is back. Thanks Scott hexximan@hotmail.com<br/>
