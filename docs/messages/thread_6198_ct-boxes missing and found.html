<br/>
I'm pretty new to this but... a couple of things to<br/>
report.  One is that I couldn't find the Milo Light<br/>
letterbox.  Is it know missing or did I just miss it? <br/>
The second is that I found the Meadow Woods box even<br/>
though it is listed as missing.  It was not in the<br/>
place where it is supposed to be according to the<br/>
clues.  We just happened to see it-It wasn't hidden at<br/>
all.  I didn't know at the time that it was missing so<br/>
we just stamped in and thought it was a nice surprise.<br/>
 Anyway, loving this hobby-thanks for all the hints<br/>
and help that you guys give.<br/>
<br/>

That is so cool about the 'missing' letterbox- I hope<br/>
it can be returned to it's spot, or clues be rewritten<br/>
if the new spot works better.  As one who has lost a<br/>
letterbox (the same one twice!) I know whomever placed<br/>
it will be happy to hear it's still alive and well. <br/>
<br/>
Happy letterboxing- hoping you find many more nice<br/>
surprises.<br/>
