<br/>
Been several months since I have talked with most of you. Unfortunately I <br/>
have been extremely busy with things other than letterboxing. Now that I <br/>
am wrapping up those responsibilities I will be getting back involved in <br/>
letterboxing. Mitch contacted me recently and suggested I get  involved <br/>
on this list so I signed up. I have created two letterboxes in the <br/>
Orlando area and placed one already (although I think I will move it <br/>
slightly in the near future due to too easy visibility).   I will be <br/>
listing them soon in the online letteboxing catalog that many of you may <br/>
remember that I created a while back. Hopefully will list them on Dan's <br/>
site also. I am currently reworking the International Letterboxing Club <br/>
site (letterboxing.com) to make the catalog accessibe  and very easy for <br/>
anyone to enter new letterboxes any time they wish. Currently the catalog <br/>
can still be accessed at <br/>
http://www.letterboxing.com/LetterboxingSite/catalog/LBSearch.lasso<br/>
<br/>
This url will change in the near future after some updates. <br/>
<br/>
I recently checked out Dan's Letterboxing USA site and it is looking <br/>
good! Also I have periodically read this list on the net and see many <br/>
familiar names and some new ones.Recently, I have had an increasing <br/>
number of people contact me via the links on my site about letterboxing. <br/>
However, because I was so busy, I generally tried to redirect them to <br/>
other sites or someone on this list for more info. <br/>

I'm glad to see that you decided to return to the hobby.  You are an<br/>
imaginative person and I hated to see petty things from the past stand in the<br/>
way of us all working together for a common goal.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure you've noticed that our new concepts have been quite popular here.<br/>
We have taken a very democratic approach to everything that's been done.  The<br/>
primary contributors to the website have been submitting their ideas to this<br/>
group.  In turn, the group has been outstanding at putting forth their<br/>
opinions and ideas.  In this way, each new feature that is added to the<br/>
website has aspects that have come about as a result of everyone's input.<br/>
<br/>
So please forgive us if we sometimes sound a bit possesive about the systems<br/>
we have in place.  Many of us have come to feel that what was originally Dan's<br/>
website has become OUR website.  We all helped build it, and we all want it to<br/>
succeed.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is great if you want to continue to devote effort to some of your<br/>
own letterboxing resources.  The internet is a big place, and I am always<br/>
happy to see new resources being added... especially if they are free!!!<br/>
<br/>
I also hope you will understand, however, that some of your resources will not<br/>
be of use to many of us.  We have our system in place, and we feel strongly<br/>
about it, because we helped make it the way it is.  Some of us have devoted<br/>
many hours to putting this all together in a way that everyone is happy with.<br/>
<br/>
I know, Eric, that you are a very busy man.  I understand that you have had<br/>
many important things to devote your time to, besides letterboxing.  If you do<br/>
have some extra time at this point to get re-involved, I guess I, for one,<br/>
would rather see you devoting your energies towards helping us build on what<br/>
we have established rather than rebuilding alternate systems.<br/>
<br/>
If you could find it in yourself to work with Dan, Randy, and the rest of us<br/>
to improve upon the site that THE PEOPLE have created, and devote the rest of<br/>
your free time to placing new letterboxes, you will be serving the good of the<br/>
hobby much more than you will be by trying to reestablish your old talk list<br/>
and catalog.<br/>
<br/>
Before working on this project, I considered myself to be one of those types<br/>
who did his best work alone.  I am anything but antisocial, yet I was not<br/>
overly comfortable with working in a team environment.  Maybe you sometimes<br/>
feel the same way, Eric.<br/>
<br/>
My way of dealing with this has been to take my ideas and run with them, up to<br/>
a point where I feel it has become obvious what I'm trying to do.  Then, I<br/>
turn the whole mess over to the group for input.  Sometimes they love what<br/>
I've done.  Sometimes they tear me apart (in a very courteous and respectful<br/>
manner, of course).  I always contemplate their input for a couple of days and<br/>
then see how I can make changes to incorporate their suggestions.  Sometimes,<br/>
I fight back feelings that my original vision has been compromised.  <br/>
<br/>
I have never regretted doing things this way.  In every single case, I have<br/>
ended up liking the results of my work better after others' feelings were<br/>
incorporated than I would have if I'd done it all according to my initial plan<br/>
of action.<br/>
<br/>
It is great to hear from you again, Eric.  You have much to offer our group.<br/>
I hope you will offer it.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mitch<br/>

<br/>
Hi Eric, I think that's a good idea.  We're failry certain that<br/>
several boxes were stumbled on accidentally in our group and this <br/>
may have resulted in thefts or vandalism.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I will be listing them soon in the online letteboxing catalog<br/>
&gt;  that many of you may remember that I created a while back.<br/>
&gt;  Hopefully will list them on Dan's site also.<br/>
<br/>
Send them in and I will be glad to post them for you.<br/>
mailto:elf@pclink.com<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I am currently reworking the International Letterboxing Club<br/>
&gt;  site (letterboxing.com) to make the catalog accessibe and very<br/>
&gt;  easy for anyone to enter new letterboxes any time they wish.<br/>
<br/>
Is ILC now public non-profit?  I assume that for "anyone to enter new<br/>
letterboxes any time they wish" means the service is now open and<br/>
non-profit.  There was a good deal of confusion on this point the last<br/>
time we corresponded.  This resulted in a clear separation of the two<br/>
site's visions/discussions.  It also resulted in a certain amount of<br/>
concern (even paranoia) among some of the Dartmoor letterboxers who<br/>
feared the eventuality of a profit-center relating to letterboxing or<br/>
even non-profit promotion which they felt may attract people for the<br/>
wrong reasons and turn the hobby into something undesirable.<br/>
<br/>
Since that time I have been approached by several advertisers<br/>
who wished to use the Letterboxing USA site.  I have not talked<br/>
to them at all and will not unless there is some widespread consensus<br/>
on the issue and also a way to ensure that any money that may be<br/>
collected could positively be funneled back to the hobby, esp. to<br/>
help newbies and/or kids get started in the fun.  No money should be<br/>
used by me unless it is needed to prevent a burdensome cost associated<br/>
with providing resources on this site.  But that is not likely at this<br/>
point because other people have offered resources and time that will<br/>
in all likelihood (if they are able to follow through with their<br/>
offers) prevent us from ever having to raise funds. <br/>
<br/>
I regret the unpleasant and uneasy way in which we parted ways<br/>
several months back, but I hope we will now be able to work more<br/>
harmoniously.  Thank you for being bold enough to come forth on<br/>
the list apparently with no ill feelings and with a willingness to<br/>
become involved and contribute time and energy to what has become<br/>
a very democratic, "group-oriented" approach.<br/>
<br/>
I think you will be impressed with the rapport, comradery and good<br/>
will that has become a hallmark of the Letterboxing USA talk list.<br/>
What is even more impressive is that we have accomplished this with<br/>
very little moderation/external controls.  A while back a guy came<br/>
in with some sharp, terse and inappropriate political comments (with<br/>
no apologies).  Several members admonished him forthwith.  He promptly<br/>
left the list.  So it has been self-moderating in that list members<br/>
seem to be of one mind regarding what's being discussed and seem to be<br/>
able to mildly correct others without producing any undue ill feelings.<br/>
Also, they have become very skilled at discussing and agreeing on new<br/>
features prior to them being added to the site.  I no longer consider<br/>
this to be "my" site as the site (with the possible exception of the<br/>
mapping) has largely been the product of all member's ideas and input.<br/>
<br/>
Randy Hall keeps a separate copy (mirror) of the site mainly to ensure<br/>
against exclusive control of the clues and/or exclusive publishing of<br/>
the clues.  It also serves as a backup in case of accidental loss of the<br/>
information.  But all my work is free and forever in the hands of those<br/>
who I consider to be owners of the site (that is all members).<br/>
If it is OK with the group (esp. Randy) I invite you to take the clues<br/>
also, and, if you are able, to provide additional non-profit services<br/>
that may augment what we have been providing with the map interface at<br/>
Letterboxing USA.  If possible, in the future, we may yet be able to <br/>
combine the two systems and thereby offer them the best of both worlds.<br/>
<br/>
I would ask you also to consult Randy especially if you desire to do<br/>
anything which requires collaboration with the data or clues.  Randy has<br/>
the greatest comprehension of this and is gathering the data into a<br/>
single list by date, name, location, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But in any case, and in any event, welcome to the list.  Anything you<br/>
need, don't hesitate to ask as someone here will likely be able to help<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Truly,<br/>
Dan<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the note! I agree that hopefully any differences we have had <br/>
in the past can be put behind us. I do want to answer your question you <br/>
asked below.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Is ILC now public non-profit?  I assume that for "anyone to enter new<br/>
&gt;letterboxes any time they wish" means the service is now open and<br/>
&gt;non-profit.  There was a good deal of confusion on this point the last<br/>
&gt;time we corresponded.  This resulted in a clear separation of the two<br/>
&gt;site's visions/discussions.  It also resulted in a certain amount of<br/>
&gt;concern (even paranoia) among some of the Dartmoor letterboxers who<br/>
&gt;feared the eventuality of a profit-center relating to letterboxing or<br/>
&gt;even non-profit promotion which they felt may attract people for the<br/>
&gt;wrong reasons and turn the hobby into something undesirable.<br/>
<br/>
ILC certainly has always been nonprofit in the sense that I have totally <br/>
supported it without one cent of revenue from anywhere else. I have not <br/>
changed my mind about the possibility of generating revenue from <br/>
advertising or sales of items (e.g. tshirts, supplies etc) at some point <br/>
in the future. However, as I stated before, membership will _always_ be <br/>
completely  Free and entitles anyone to post clues in the searchable <br/>
database (online letterbox catalog) and use any of the onsite resources I <br/>
may create. Anyone will be able to access the database to search for <br/>
clues- not requiring membership. There is a possibility that at some <br/>
point in time the number of letterboxes listed will be significant enough <br/>
that I may publish pamphlets for specific geographic regions. These would <br/>
be available for purchase. I have decided that anyone who lists <br/>
letterboxes in the online letterbox catalog will be able to CHOOSE (via a <br/>
preference they can set in their records) whether their box clues will be <br/>
included in any other publication I may produce. I also intend to offer <br/>
the ability for members to "log" finds of boxes so that you can visit the <br/>
site and see how many people have logged a find of any particular <br/>
letterbox. Again participation in this is entirely voluntary for any <br/>
letterbox owner (i.e. you have to choose to have your box "logable"). I <br/>
think this is as fair and open choice as possible. <br/>
<br/>
I do not know how to address any concerns about "attract people for the <br/>
wrong reasons and turn the hobby into something undesirable." I have <br/>
always believed that NONE of us has ability/right to determine who wants <br/>
to participate in  letterboxing and how they want to conduct their <br/>
participation. It is going to develop in as many ways as creative <br/>
individuals wish to devote the time and resources to participate. If the <br/>
issue is attempting to remain secretive versus trying to interest more of <br/>
the general public, that is where I differ from some. As I have said many <br/>
times, I believe there are a great many people who love such a hobby if <br/>
they knew it existed. My personal approach is to participate in <br/>
activities that promote the hobby to those who haven't yet discovered it. <br/>
<br/>
I really think everyone who has participated has done a great job with <br/>
the Letterboxing USA site. It looks quite nice and is very informative <br/>
for "newbies". There several letterboxing sites on the net now and I <br/>
expect that there will be many more over the forseeable future. I expect <br/>
there will even be more mailing lists develop (besides this one and the <br/>
letterboxing-talk of ILC) to meet the divergent interest of participants. <br/>
Although all the site owners visions will be different, I believe it to <br/>
everyone's best interest to cooperate and cross promote to the extent <br/>
practical. I would like everyone to post their clues in my catalog. I <br/>
will also recommend that anyone with boxes in the USA also post clues on <br/>
the Letterbox USA site. I would like to cross promote our discussion <br/>
groups as well and perhaps we need to address how they could be <br/>
complimentary at some point in the future. I have recently addressed this <br/>
question to the letterboxing-talk list (of which many of you also are <br/>
members). I would also specifically invite Dan to join again if he wishes.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this clarifies and addresses any lingering concerns Dan may have <br/>
had about our differences in the past. If anyone has questions or wants <br/>
any clarification of any aspect of my vision/intentions please feel free <br/>
to contact me at any time. I will be out of town this weekend so I won't <br/>
likely have a chance to answer any emails from Fri until Sunday. <br/>

&gt; I do not know how to address any concerns about "attract people for the <br/>
&gt;  wrong reasons and turn the hobby into something undesirable." I have <br/>
&gt;  always believed that NONE of us has ability/right to determine who wants <br/>
&gt;  to participate in  letterboxing and how they want to conduct their <br/>
&gt;  participation. It is going to develop in as many ways as creative <br/>
&gt;  individuals wish to devote the time and resources to participate. If the <br/>
&gt;  issue is attempting to remain secretive versus trying to interest more of <br/>
&gt;  the general public, that is where I differ from some. As I have said many <br/>
&gt;  times, I believe there are a great many people who love such a hobby if <br/>
&gt;  they knew it existed. My personal approach is to participate in <br/>
&gt;  activities that promote the hobby to those who haven't yet discovered it. <br/>
<br/>
Eric,<br/>
If you explore the archive of this talk list thoroughly, you will find more<br/>
than Doc M jokes.  You will also find out about some of the traditions and<br/>
courtesies associated with our hobby.  Granted, the American version of the<br/>
hobby is much different than the original UK version.  In the UK, they are<br/>
VERY secretive about their letterboxes.  Some of our UK friends have even had<br/>
boxes destroyed in retaliation for a falsely perceived breech of confidence.  <br/>
<br/>
In the US, however, we are more tolerant.  Still, while there are few formal<br/>
'rules' for our hobby, there is a special 'code' amongst letterboxers that<br/>
applies on both sides of the big pond.  We are, of course, in the very early<br/>
stages of development here.  Nonetheless, with fewer than 100 boxes in the<br/>
country, we have already had at least seven destroyed by vandals.  While we<br/>
are determined not to let this sort of senselessness ruin our fun, these are<br/>
not very promising odds for our first year of activity.<br/>
<br/>
Dan's reference to attracting people for the wrong reasons and turning the<br/>
hobby into something undesirable is a reflection of many months of discussion<br/>
on this list.  We have discussed our desire that this hobby might possibly<br/>
reach critical mass and become a legitimate nationwide pastime without drawing<br/>
attention from the mainstream populace.  This pastime has thrived in Dartmoor<br/>
for 145 years while still maintaining this level of 'underground' appeal.<br/>
<br/>
Promotion is necessary, but the concensus of opinion has insisted that it<br/>
should be very limited in scope.  We have targeted all of our promotion, up to<br/>
this point, on very specialized interest groups such as rubber stamp artists,<br/>
hikers, orienteering buffs, birdwatchers, scouts, etc.  Most of us have very<br/>
little interest in having our hobby come to the attention of the general<br/>
populace.  If we go this route, the likelyhood that online resources such as<br/>
Letterboxing USA and the ILC will remain viable means for distribution of<br/>
clues is very small.  Overexposure will result in vandalism, which will force<br/>
the hobby off of the Net.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is for adventurous, inquisitive people.  These people will find<br/>
us with little effort on our parts.  A few carefully placed blurbs in several<br/>
specialized media will be adequate for making the information available to<br/>
those with enough initiative to discover it.  As letterboxers, we all have an<br/>
obligation to help protect the code of honor which forbids us from doing<br/>
anything that might compromise the sanctity of the boxes of our fellow<br/>
hobbyists.<br/>
<br/>
This code of honor also extends to our friends oversees, which is why I<br/>
recently suggested that if a certain overzealous web publisher did not remove<br/>
some unauthorized Dartmoor clues from his website, that we should consider<br/>
encouraging our group members to 'flame' the individual via email.  Of course,<br/>
this was a last-resort suggestion that should never be acted upon unless the<br/>
perpetrator became belligerent about the issue.<br/>
<br/>
My advice on this subject is that we don't allow either of the websites to<br/>
become too commercially 'accessible' or we will risk losing the support of the<br/>
hobbyists and artisans that make this all possible.  Individually, some of us<br/>
may have differing visions and opinions, but if our actions run against the<br/>
grain of the letterboxing community, we will be left behind and the hobby will<br/>
develop without us.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is ALIVE in the United States.  It has grown to the point that it<br/>
no longer needs any of us to define what it is, or decide how it will grow.<br/>
It's going to develop in a way that feels right to the active participants of<br/>
the hobby.  All we can do, as web developers, is stay in touch with the<br/>
feelings of our fellow letterboxers and try to reflect these feelings in our<br/>
projects.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Der Mad Stamper<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well spoken posting about the issues! <br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of comments I would like to throw out on these issues. <br/>
First, is that the issues secrecy and potential for vandalism were <br/>
debated extensively on the letterboxing talk list long before this list <br/>
existed. Many potential solutions were proposed, and really nothing has <br/>
changed about the problem since then. It is a problem and I still believe <br/>
that each individual has to consider how it affects the boxes they place.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Letterboxing is for adventurous, inquisitive people.  These people will find<br/>
&gt;us with little effort on our parts.  A few carefully placed blurbs in several<br/>
&gt;specialized media will be adequate for making the information available to<br/>
&gt;those with enough initiative to discover it.  As letterboxers, we all have an<br/>
&gt;obligation to help protect the code of honor which forbids us from doing<br/>
&gt;anything that might compromise the sanctity of the boxes of our fellow<br/>
&gt;hobbyists.<br/>
<br/>
I believe we have an obligation to allow anyone who participates to <br/>
choose how they believe is the best method to safeguard the "sanctity" of <br/>
the boxes. There are many options available to individuals who place <br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;This code of honor also extends to our friends oversees, which is why I<br/>
&gt;recently suggested that if a certain overzealous web publisher did not remove<br/>
&gt;some unauthorized Dartmoor clues from his website, that we should consider<br/>
&gt;encouraging our group members to 'flame' the individual via email.  Of <br/>
&gt;course,<br/>
&gt;this was a last-resort suggestion that should never be acted upon unless the<br/>
&gt;perpetrator became belligerent about the issue.<br/>
<br/>
Placing clues about someone else's letterbox ANYWHERE without permission, <br/>
whether print or web, is totally unacceptable in my opinion. Only the <br/>
individual who placed the letterbox should have that decision. <br/>
<br/>
&gt;My advice on this subject is that we don't allow either of the websites to<br/>
&gt;become too commercially 'accessible' or we will risk losing the support of <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;hobbyists and artisans that make this all possible.  Individually, some of us<br/>
&gt;may have differing visions and opinions, but if our actions run against the<br/>
&gt;grain of the letterboxing community, we will be left behind and the hobby <br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt;develop without us.<br/>
<br/>
The hobby is going to develop in many different ways no matter what any <br/>
of us individually thinks about it. I believe we should encourage <br/>
creativity, individual choice, diversity, and tolerance. What makes the <br/>
hobby "possible" is people of any walk of life who have an interest in <br/>
the concept regardless of artistic or physical talents.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Letterboxing is ALIVE in the United States.  It has grown to the point <br/>
&gt;that it<br/>
&gt;no longer needs any of us to define what it is, or decide how it will grow.<br/>

&gt;the hobby.  All we can do, as web developers, is stay in touch with the<br/>
&gt;feelings of our fellow letterboxers and try to reflect these feelings in our<br/>
&gt;projects.<br/>
<br/>
Agreed.<br/>
<br/>
I have recently given much thought again to the issue of secrecy and <br/>
individual choice. I intend to modify my database (ILC Online Letterbox <br/>
Catalog) to allow box owners a choice of who can see their clues. One <br/>
choice is the default now on my site, as well as the way it is on the <br/>
Letterbox USA site-- anyone can view them. However, I intend to allow <br/>
another choice, the requirement of an access code that is <br/>
created/modified/distributed by individual box owners. Thus if someone <br/>
would like to control access to who can view their clues, they can set an <br/>
access code and only distribute it to those whom they trust. I believe <br/>
that ultimately this is the only workable solution for balancing the <br/>
power of the internet with individual choice about what level of secrecy <br/>
they would like to attach to their participation in the hobby. Comments?<br/>
