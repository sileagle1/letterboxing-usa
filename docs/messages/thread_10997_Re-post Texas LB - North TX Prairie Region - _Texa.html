<br/>
The "Texas Birth" Letterbox can be found at Washington-on-the-Brazos <br/>
State Historical Park, where Texas officially declared its <br/>
independence from Mexico on March 2, 1836.  The park preserves a <br/>
replica of Independence Hall, where the document was signed (while <br/>
the Alamo fell).  Be sure to tour the Star of the Republic Museum, <br/>
which depicts the colorful saga of the Texas Republic.  Also see the <br/>
home of the last President of the Republic of Texas, Anson Jones.  <br/>
The new Visitor Center if worth a look also, as well as the <br/>
Barrington Living History Farm.  Enjoy hiking the trails along the <br/>
Brazos River among the pecan trees.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
The "Texas Birth" letterbox is located in Washington-on-the-Brazos <br/>
SHP, west of Navasota.  From Navasota, take Hwy 105 west for 7 miles, <br/>
turn let on FM1155 to the park on your left.  From Brenham, take Hwy <br/>
105 east for 14 miles, turn right on FM912 to the park<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Enter the park and follow the signs to the Visitor Center (stay <br/>
left).  Park in the lot, and go into the center and look around.  <br/>
Obtain a park map also.  Once your ready, exit the back doors of the <br/>
V.C., and follow the path to Independence Hall (about 100 yards).  <br/>
Just past the Hall, go right (north) at the path crossing.  Follow <br/>
this path up, then down hill to the River Overlook, for about 200 <br/>
yards.  At the last sign on your left before you reach the overlook, <br/>
be sure to note the year that Andrew Robinson's ferry started <br/>
operations.  After reaching the overlook, and viewing the confluence <br/>
of the Brazos and Navasota Rivers, back track to the trail junction <br/>
and the garbage can on the tree.  Take the trail heading upstream <br/>
(northwest) at 320 degrees.  From the trash can you will go ???? <br/>
paces up this trail (This is where you need that year from the Ferry <br/>
sign.  Add the first digit and third digit of the year.  This is the <br/>
first number.  Now but the third digit behind that number.  This is <br/>
the amount of paces you need to go  - hint - between 30 and 50).  One <br/>
you have paces this off, locate the fallen trees on your right.  Walk <br/>
to, and along, the fallen tree closest to the trail to the broken off <br/>
stump (12 paces).  From this stump, face 60 degrees and go about 2 <br/>
paces to another fallen tree going east.  On the North side of this <br/>
tree is a cavity which contains the box (which is near its west end).<br/>
