When we talk about the pioneers, she and her husband are among the few who can really be put in that category.  We would probably all do well to listen to her words.  Thank you Susan.<br/>

Subject: Re: [LbNA] Protecting LbNA clues through membership -- (Was:<br/>
How?????)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A founding principle of LbNA is that access to clues is FREE!   The concept<br/>
is well expressed by the vignette of a child going to the public-access<br/>
library computer and downloading a few clues for a family adventure.  When<br/>
you understand that this primary principle is a GIFT to the world, then you<br/>
may feel more comfortable with the flotsam that can wash up on the shore<br/>
every once in a while.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing that has happened recently  that hasn't also happened in<br/>
previous years when there were a lot fewer boxes (less than 100 nationwide).<br/>
Statistically, the rate of vandalism, box snatchers, inaccurate media<br/>
reporting, and mean-spirited people has decreased as the past-time has<br/>
evolved.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, if a structured organization were to be founded the potential for<br/>
liability would be so great that It is unlikely anyone would find it<br/>
financially feasible to be an administrator.  This is a Volunteer<br/>
organization.<br/>
<br/>
In the early days there were several personages who wished to profit from<br/>
letterboxing, they are no longer with us.  However, the urge to close the<br/>
corral gates will probably be with us forever.  My wisdom is that there are<br/>
some things, like rivers, that are eternal and all you can do is borrow the<br/>
energy but not possess the water.  Letterboxing is like that.<br/>
<br/>
Just let it flow and keep on boxin'<br/>
