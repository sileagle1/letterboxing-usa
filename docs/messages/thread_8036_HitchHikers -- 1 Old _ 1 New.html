Crosswinds Marsh Box #1, toured the East Coast with me for a week, <br/>
but couldn't find anywhere he was comfortable hanging out (he has a <br/>
hard-sided suitcase, not just a duffle bag) and said he had already <br/>
seen a lot of that area anyway.  So he came back to Michigan with me, <br/>
celebrated his 2-yr. anniversary (9/17/02) and has now set out on the <br/>
trails of West Michigan seeking new adventures.<br/>
<br/>
Traveling Jester, a new hitchhiker, has been hanging out with me for <br/>
a while, waiting for me to give the Interlochen box another try, as <br/>
he was hoping to be able to visit some of his performing arts buddies <br/>
up there.  But it doesn't look like I'll be back up that way any time <br/>
soon, so he decided to start his travels today, here in West <br/>
Michigan...  who knows maybe he'll make his way up to Interlochen in <br/>
the near future.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
