I'm looking at starting to do some letterboxing.  I'm a geocacher and<br/>
have come across some hybrid letterboxes and decided to look into it a<br/>
bit.  I don't see myself getting heavily into letterboxing, but I will<br/>
probably do some on occasion.  My problem is that there aren't all<br/>
that many out there at this time.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I have a couple questions.  Where did you folks get<br/>
your ideas for your personal stamps?  Did you make your own, or did<br/>
you buy a stamp?  I'm planning on making mine, but can't think of a<br/>
good design right now.  Now for the log books.  I've seen some unlined<br/>
"journal" types of books out there.  Really nice, but the problem is<br/>
they are expensive.  I've seen some for over $100.  Now that's a lot<br/>
of money for a notebook.  Any suggestions on a good quality book<br/>
that's reasonably priced?<br/>
<br/>
Once I'm at a letterbox, I know I stamp the books, but do people also<br/>
write up a log entry?  I know that with geocaching, some people write<br/>
up an elaborate log entry where others just put their name.  It seems<br/>
like letterboxing would attract some fairly artistic folks, so would<br/>
expect elaborate prose.  Would I be disappointed expecting this?  Are<br/>
there trade items, or is the entire experience the find?  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long post, just trying to get a handle on what to<br/>
expect.<br/>

<br/>
First, welcome to letterboxing. I do letterboxing with the occasional geocache. From what I've seen, a majority of letterboxers carve their stamp with whatever design appeals to them, some simple and some elaborate, but many use a purchased stamp or use a stamp that they designed and had custom made. My journal was under $10. It's a Strathmore sketch pad, 5.5" x 8.5" using 60lb acid free paper with a spiral binding to make it easier to lay flat.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'd recommend joining the Newboxer's group. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/. There's less traffic and it's designed for people that are new to letterboxing and those that want to help them with their questions.<br/>
<br/>

Ok, folks, thanks for the links.  However, I have looked at the links,<br/>
except for the Atlas Quest one, and that's why I posted my questions<br/>
here.  They weren't answered to my liking on those sites.  I haven't<br/>
had time to look at the Atlas Quest site yet, and didn't know it even<br/>
existed.<br/>
<br/>
I'm interested in different people's opinions, not just the web site<br/>
designer's opinion.  I'm interested in how people came up with their<br/>
design, what their opinion on the different notebooks available, and<br/>
what people put into the logs.<br/>
<br/>
I may be a newbie here, but I've been in many different yahoo groups<br/>
and know to do a little homework first.  Thanks in advance.<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">    My personal stamp design is from my college alma mater.  Most, but not<br/>
all, people pick something personally meaningful.  Some people pick a design<br/>
that's just cool or pretty.  Carving your own stamps is considered<br/>
preferable, so most people do that, though there are some store-bought<br/>
stamps that you'll see floating around out there.  There's no stigma, per<br/>
se, but people find it more rewarding in general to find a box with a<br/>
hand-carved stamp, or to see hand-carved stamp images in box logs.<br/>
    Also, there's no need to pay that much money for a journal.  I bought an<br/>
art sketchbook, heavy paper and about half the size of a piece of filler<br/>
paper for about $10.  Go to an art store or even Staples should have<br/>
something in their art supply section that should do you just fine.  <br/>
    As for whether people write log entries, some do.  Everybody writes<br/>
their "trail name" and the date they were there.  Some people make personal<br/>
notations about the weather or the hike, or something about the box itself<br/>
if they feel moved to.  But most entries, I've found, are pretty basic.<br/>
Unlike geocaching, there are no trade items.  What's traded are images in<br/>
your logbook.  Sometimes you'll find what's called a "hitchhiker," which is<br/>
another stamp and logbook residing temporarily inside or next to a<br/>
letterbox.  You take that hitchhiker with you and then deposit it in another<br/>
location, basically.  But that's the only time I can think of that you would<br/>
take something from a letterbox, unless it was a letterbox/geocache hybrid.<br/>

&gt; what people put into the logs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just my .00003 of a cent..... From a near-newbie..... :-)<br/>
<br/>
Stamp designs - I'm pretty new myself, but have noticed that new folks <br/>
tend to worry about this a lot. My signature stamp relates to another <br/>
hobby of mine. I collect Pez, so my stamp is a negative carving of my <br/>
favorite dispenser. My daughter uses a ladybug since she's always been <br/>
my Little Bug. Some who LB with their dogs use a pic of their dog. <br/>
Others just use a motif they happen to like - dragons, celtic knots, <br/>
pumpkins, fish, flowers, characters etc..... Really, anything works and <br/>
you can change your signature stamp later if you want. (I ran into a <br/>
woman on the trail this past weekend who has seasonal signature stamps!)<br/>
<br/>
Notebooks - anything unlined that's 3x5 or larger should work and be <br/>
large enough for most stamps you find. You can get into acid-free if <br/>
you want. I use a book that was originally sold to be a journal - it's <br/>
about 6x8 and probably not archival, but it works well. Some folks use <br/>
a spiral-bound set of 3x5 cards. Some folks simply stamp onto a loose <br/>
3x5 card and then put the stamp in a larger notebook when they get home.<br/>
<br/>
As for what goes into logs - it's whatever you want at the moment. I <br/>
mostly see just a trail name and date, but some folks add a short note <br/>
related to the stamp, the location, or the hike to the location. Nobody <br/>
expects amazing prose, though I am sure the logbook owner wouldn't mind <br/>
if you were so moved.<br/>
<br/>
There are usually no exchanges of trinkets, just stamp images. <br/>
Occasionally, someone will leave a small token for the first finder or <br/>
something like a bunch of pins so that each finder can have one, but <br/>
this is not the norm in my experience. If you find items in the box, <br/>
check the logbook and.or clues to see if it's something you should take <br/>
- it might be something someone left for the box' creator as a <br/>
thank-you.......<br/>
<br/>
So, my advice probably boils down to this - if you find yourself <br/>
obsessing (I think we all do over something at the beginning), take a <br/>
deep breath and just move forward. It's much more fun to be out there <br/>
hunting LBs than to be worried about the 'correct' stamp or logbook.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
      My personal stamp design is from my college alma mater.  Most, but not<br/>
  all, people pick something personally meaningful.  Some people pick a design<br/>
  that's just cool or pretty.  Carving your own stamps is considered<br/>
  preferable, so most people do that, though there are some store-bought<br/>
  stamps that you'll see floating around out there.  There's no stigma, per<br/>
  se, but people find it more rewarding in general to find a box with a<br/>
  hand-carved stamp, or to see hand-carved stamp images in box logs.<br/>
      Also, there's no need to pay that much money for a journal.  I bought an<br/>
  art sketchbook, heavy paper and about half the size of a piece of filler<br/>
  paper for about $10.  Go to an art store or even Staples should have<br/>
  something in their art supply section that should do you just fine.  <br/>
      As for whether people write log entries, some do.  Everybody writes<br/>
  their "trail name" and the date they were there.  Some people make personal<br/>
  notations about the weather or the hike, or something about the box itself<br/>
  if they feel moved to.  But most entries, I've found, are pretty basic.<br/>
  Unlike geocaching, there are no trade items.  What's traded are images in<br/>
  your logbook.  Sometimes you'll find what's called a "hitchhiker," which is<br/>
  another stamp and logbook residing temporarily inside or next to a<br/>
  letterbox.  You take that hitchhiker with you and then deposit it in another<br/>
  location, basically.  But that's the only time I can think of that you would<br/>
  take something from a letterbox, unless it was a letterbox/geocache hybrid.<br/>
<br/>
  Best,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I'm looking at starting to do some letterboxing.  I'm a geocacher and<br/>
  &gt; have come across some hybrid letterboxes and decided to look into it a<br/>
  &gt; bit.  I don't see myself getting heavily into letterboxing, but I will<br/>
  &gt; probably do some on occasion.  My problem is that there aren't all<br/>
  &gt; that many out there at this time.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; That being said, I have a couple questions.  Where did you folks get<br/>
  &gt; your ideas for your personal stamps?  Did you make your own, or did<br/>
  &gt; you buy a stamp?  I'm planning on making mine, but can't think of a<br/>
  &gt; good design right now.  Now for the log books.  I've seen some unlined<br/>
  &gt; "journal" types of books out there.  Really nice, but the problem is<br/>
  &gt; they are expensive.  I've seen some for over $100.  Now that's a lot<br/>
  &gt; of money for a notebook.  Any suggestions on a good quality book<br/>
  &gt; that's reasonably priced?<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Once I'm at a letterbox, I know I stamp the books, but do people also<br/>
  &gt; write up a log entry?  I know that with geocaching, some people write<br/>
  &gt; up an elaborate log entry where others just put their name.  It seems<br/>
  &gt; like letterboxing would attract some fairly artistic folks, so would<br/>
  &gt; expect elaborate prose.  Would I be disappointed expecting this?  Are<br/>
  &gt; there trade items, or is the entire experience the find?  <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Sorry for the long post, just trying to get a handle on what to<br/>
  &gt; expect.<br/>

I had looked into letterboxing previously, so I had done some research<br/>
about a year ago.  Then my interest again got piqued when I saw that<br/>
there were many more in the area that I had remembered.  I didn't know<br/>
the Atlas Quest sight existed, so I had never gone thru that one. <br/>
I've signed up for the newbie group, and did a some searching thru<br/>
that one.  I have been thru the letterboxing.org site previously, and<br/>
that site led me to the Silent Doug site, which I went thru at that<br/>
same time.<br/>

Our family all has bound art sketchbooks, each of a different shape/ color so we can tell them apart quickly from the outside.  Most of them are Strathmore ones.  But my daughter's, which I thought was going to be fine, has paper with a tiny bit of "tooth".  Most of the time she can get a good image, but she's been disappointed now and then to find stamps that are carved with very shallow lines and she's had trouble getting a decent image of these in her book.  You want something with heavier weight paper that won't bleed through, but without texture and without sheen (that can smear too easily).  I think all of ours were under $15.  Art supply stores such as Dick Blick or Rose Art will have a large collection of fine books.  Looking back on it, I kinda wish I'd have decided to take cards along and put them in my book upon return instead.  I like to have enough space to write notes about the find, so I usually only put one or two stamps per page, even though I have a 7 X 7" book or so. I like that size and I like the square format, but if you don't like dragging much along while hiking and don't care about writing notes in it, you may want something smaller. I'm used to dragging photo equipment, so a little extra is ok for me.  Good luck!   --lunaryakketyact<br/>

I'm the quiet type (is that muffled laughter I hear out there?), so I don't <br/>

If I'm outside my usual stamping grounds, I'll add the state where I live <br/>
just to let the planter know that letterboxers have travelled from both <br/>
near and far to visit their box.<br/>

While many letterboxers routinely add a short note when logging in to a <br/>
letterbox, it's not required.<br/>
<br/>
Also, some letterboxers use their personal journals as diaries, and add the <br/>
details of their hike, who they were with, what the weather was like, the <br/>
interesting things they saw along the way, etc., to each of their letterbox <br/>
finds.<br/>

a family joke. So I decieded to use that as my trail<br/>
name. As for my sig stamp it's a cat wearing a hat<br/>
with a feather, The hat and fether rfer to a<br/>
letterboxing red hat group I belong to. As for<br/>
journals, I'm a scrapbooker and  use that format. I<br/>
stamp  on a seperate paper and then mount  the image<br/>
together with a picture of the site and a copy of the<br/>
clues. This is alot more work than most people put<br/>
into it but I enjpy the whole process.<br/>

&gt; letterbox, it's not required.<br/>

I tried to write a poem in each logbook for awhile there, but so many of the <br/>
logbooks were too small, I quit doing it.<br/>

&gt;Where did you folks get your ideas for your personal stamps? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our personal stamps are hand carved and reflect our trail names.  Mine<br/>
is a nutty cat we use to have. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Now for the log books.<br/>
<br/>
We use spiral bound memory books picked up in Michaels Crafts.  They<br/>
come in all sizes and many are less than $10.00.  The paper is smooth,<br/>
acid free and thick enough not to bleed through.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Once I'm at a letterbox, I know I stamp the books, but do people<br/>
&gt;also write up a log entry?  <br/>
<br/>
We might write a few words in the letterbox logbook.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

If there are not too many letterboxes in your area, then more are <br/>
needed.  Plant some and you will help the hobby catch on.<br/>
<br/>
I am from Connecticut and we have lots of boxes here.  What state <br/>
are you from? <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing needs several boxes in an area for it to take off.  <br/>
There may be people interested in boxing near you, but they need <br/>
enough boxes to find to catch the bug.  Then it will grow in your <br/>
area.  Also you can join the regional talk list.  Then you can see <br/>
how many boxers are active locally.<br/>

If y'all would welcome a comment from the peanut gallery...<br/>
<br/>
Here's how I've made my logbooks:<br/>
<br/>
I got a package of Hammermill Bright White Color Copier <br/>
acid-free paper for about $10. Not inkjet paper, which often <br/>
has coatings and different formulations in the sheets. <br/>
This isn't laser paper, either... it's "copier paper", which is <br/>
meant for higher speeds, so it's a bit stronger.<br/>
<br/>
I took ten or so sheets out of the package and cut <br/>
them in quarters. I then adjusted a three-hole punch to<br/>
two-hole-punch mode, and punched holes in one longer side<br/>
of the pages. I used 1-inch binder rings (about $3/box of 20)<br/>
to hold them together.<br/>
<br/>
So, I can make 12 40-page logbooks for about a buck each!<br/>
<br/>
I've made the covers in a couple of different ways. I'd have to say <br/>
that they added another $1 to price of the book.<br/>

<br/>
Okay, the above math clearly demonstrates why<br/>
I'm NOT an accountant!<br/>
<br/>
Let's try again...<br/>
500 sheets / 10 sheets per book = 50 books per package<br/>
$10 per package / 50 books = $0.20 per book!<br/>
<br/>
20 rings / 2 per book = 10 books per ring box<br/>
$3 per pkg / 10 books = $0.30 per book<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that's better... now I really feel better about spending<br/>
$10 on a package of paper that will never see the inside of <br/>
a copier!<br/>

I'm in Maryland and there are quite a few here.  There's about 200<br/>
listed on the site.  That's not bad, but coming from the geocaching<br/>
side of the house, that's not many compared to the 1000 or more<br/>
geocaches.  Now those geocaches are mostly urban micros, but there's<br/>
many that are nice hikes thru the woods.<br/>
<br/>
I will start letterboxing and will carry my stamp and log in my<br/>
caching bag in case I make it to an area that's got some letterboxes I<br/>
didn't hit.<br/>
