to "gather by the river" on Saturday, and made that event such a huge <br/>
success! So many creative people and great cooks ,too! (Friendly <br/>
folks, fabulous food, fantastic flowers and fun finds - how's that <br/>
for an "F count"? :-) I actually got 35 exchanges, 5 personal <br/>
travellers, 5 hitchers, 3 event stamps,and a whole bunch of boxes, <br/>
including "Universal Language" on Sunday as my #2500! (very <br/>
appropriate since I had studied about a dozen languages many years <br/>
ago, but if I tried to speak any of them now, it would probably come <br/>
out sounding pretty much like the clues to that letterbox - 2 words <br/>
from one language, 3 from another, etc.! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks for everything go to the "Doubtful Guests". Our little <br/>
New England contingent (Sarah, Russ and myself) was extremely <br/>
fortunate to have them take us under their wing for an incredible  <br/>
dinner Saturday evening, followed by letterboxing practically in <br/>
their backyard! (Scarab even wrote up some clues for me to find a <br/>
certain remarkable "hobbit hole" where I got to crawl in and spend <br/>
the night - pure magic!) The predicted rains didn't come until I was <br/>
on my way home yesterday, so we got in plenty of nice boxing Sunday <br/>
afternoon and Monday, mostly in the Leesburg, Herndon, and Vienna <br/>
areas, with a lovely trip up to Hemlock Overlook that evening so that <br/>
Scarab could get his 100th find! (and I even ran into an old "thru-<br/>
hiker" friend of mine up there at the same time - talk about <br/>
synchronicity!)  Did some boxing in the rain on my way home <br/>
(VA8,MD3,PA5), and overall had a really great time! Thanks so much, <br/>
muchas gracias, vielen Dank, hvala lepo, etc.etc.etc.!<br/>
