                    <div class="plaintext-content">Call me a nerd.  Call me a quasi-intellectual.  Call me anything (but don't <br/>
call me late for Baskin Robbins -- Ba dum Bum....)  But, there is nothing I <br/>
like more (aside from chocolate) than learning something new and <br/>
interesting.  It just takes me by surprise and makes me happy (I'm <br/>
notoriously easy to please!)  So, it was with a ridiculous amount of glee <br/>
that we stood looking over the eagle's nest reproduction at the Earth Place <br/>
in Westport.  At first I thought it was just an artist's conception of an <br/>
eagle's nest, but, no, it was an actual reproduction.  What's the big deal?  <br/>
Big is the big deal.  That sucker was over five feet in diameter!  <br/>
Escalade-sized!  How cool is that?!  I never imagined (ok -- I never really <br/>
thought about it that much, but if I had...) that a bird could build a nest <br/>
that large.  I told you I was easily impressed.  Anyway, I just had to let <br/>
everyone know about it -- it was neat-O!<br/>
<br/>
There were lots of cool parts of the nature center.  I also really loved the <br/>
tile wall they are constructing.  They are in colorful bas relief and the <br/>
animals and plant life pop away from the wall.  It is beautiful.  I liked it <br/>
so much that I kept the guy talking about it for ten minutes even though we <br/>
don't live in the area.  Maybe I can get mom and dad to buy a tile for the <br/>
wall (that is if they have any more money left over after Madeleine cleans <br/>
out all the gift shops!...)<br/>
<br/>
The gift shop was actually our first stop at the museum -- isn't that always <br/>
the case with little kids?!  Be and Ma looked at every item in the little <br/>
shop.  They looked, they toyed with and they dropped (normally on the floor <br/>
somewhere far away from where it was actually shelved) every trinket in <br/>
sight.<br/>
<br/>
With promises of future purchases - if they were good on the trail -- we <br/>
grabbed a trail map (to add to all our information on the tile wall) and <br/>
headed outside.  It was hot and muggy.  We were proud to have remembered the <br/>
trail map because we were short on time.  There was only one problem.  The <br/>
trail map was a little "interpretive" shall we say plus none of the actual <br/>
real-life trail heads were labeled!  We eventually found one that had a <br/>
trail sign -- but it had been painted over.  The name of the trail  was <br/>
under several coats of dark green paint and peeked out only slightly.<br/>
<br/>
There WERE lots of signs at the start of each foray into the woods -- But <br/>
they were all about ticks and lyme disease.  How's that for a fine welcome!! <br/>
  After that, I shied away from every piece of grass and quivered going <br/>
under every tree!  They take their ticks seriously here!!<br/>
<br/>
We were looking forward to doing Frosty because it was such a novel idea -- <br/>
each stamp adds onto the total figure.  Of course, we soon realized that <br/>
this can become an issue when you can't find the first stamp...<br/>
<br/>
We headed as far to the side as we could, which, according to the map, <br/>
seemed to be the entrance to the Swamp loop trail.  Nope.  We soon realized <br/>
(via the mysterious lack of the bridges listed in the clues) that we could <br/>
not possibly be on the Swamp Loop Trail.  What to do?  What to do?  Na had <br/>
spent way too much time at the tile wall and the eagle's nest (being flooded <br/>
by the light of learning) and now we were short on time.<br/>
<br/>
We decided to press on.  We passed a bench, and, after scanning the clues <br/>
once more, deduced that we were actually on the High Woods Trail.  Past the <br/>
bench and past the stone wall, we found our first piece of Frosty!  This is <br/>
where one's artistic judgment comes into play.  How to dress a stamp image <br/>
with no body?  We all made do and stamped part of Frosty in the general area <br/>
where we thought this part of Frosty would be if we actually had the body of <br/>
Frosty to stamp on (think pin the tail on the donkey) and continued on.<br/>
<br/>
After a brief detour following the wrong part of the yellow trail, we came <br/>
to Frosty piece two (two for us, actually piece three for the series) and <br/>
stamped where we thought this part should go.  I had a feeling Picasso would <br/>
have been proud of our design...<br/>
<br/>
Past more tick warning signs and onto a skinny little trail, we headed out <br/>
in search of more snowman.  The sky had started to darken and the sounds of <br/>
thunder could be heard.  We were already jumpy due to all the tick signs so <br/>
we picked up the pace.  We made it to the last wall by the narrow, curvy <br/>
road.  The fourth piece of Frosty was rumored to be hidden at the end of the <br/>
stone wall.  So I left the kids, scurried through the narrow opening in the <br/>
fence (getting stuck with my backpack) and skirted the curvy, narrow road <br/>
following the wall.  "Hon" Da shouted...  "I know, I know, I hear the <br/>
thunder, I'll be right back"  "Hon" called Da once more as he started toward <br/>
the road "Stay there with the kids" I yelled back "I'll get it, I'll get it" <br/>
  The wall was seeming awfully long and there was no shoulder to the road.  <br/>
Thunder peeled again.  "Hon..."  "What?!!!"  "I found the stamp already -- <br/>
it was on this end of the wall..."  ooops....  I scurried back along the <br/>
road and through the fence (got stuck again)  Now I know how the squirrels <br/>
feel, and, smiling with a bit of embarrassment, stamped this piece of Frosty <br/>
some where toward the top of the log book page.<br/>
<br/>
Ma was getting very nervous and clingy.  Between the pricklies and the <br/>
thunder (ever since the Statue of Liberty fiasco she has been desperately <br/>
afraid of being caught out in the rain) she was in no condition to go on.  <br/>
We retraced our steps back to the nature center and to the safety of the <br/>
GIFT SHOP.<br/>
<br/>
After much rumination and deliberation, Be walked out the proud owner of a <br/>
critter catching kit and Miss Ma, with a twinkle of satisfaction in her eye, <br/>
proudly held aloft her purchase of --  several rocks.  I don't even mean <br/>
cool "gem" rocks like amethyst or cat's eye.  I mean regular pick em up off <br/>
the ground rocks.  One was gray, one was this weird mossy green and one was <br/>
quartz.  At two dollars a shot (now here's a money-making scheme I hadn't <br/>
tried...)  Before we even exited the building, the quartz broke into two <br/>
pieces (I tried to look at it as an investment  -- a rock split like a stock <br/>
split -- twice the dividend...)<br/>
<br/>
Despite not finding all of Frosty (this time) we had a lot of fun at Earth <br/>
Place.  We saw deer and wild turkeys and the but-end of some brown fuzzy <br/>
large rodent thing.  We need to find a good brown fuzzy but identification <br/>
website to look that one up...<br/>
<br/>
I guess, when you think about it, we found the parts of Frosty that made <br/>
sense for August.  All the outside snow part must have just melted away, <br/>
leaving the clothes and other parts behind.  BeMa<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  We have to mention two other cool museums (kids -- read "gift shops") <br/>
that we visited in the area and really enjoyed.  One is the Maritime Center <br/>
and the Other is Stepping Stones.  They are both in Norwalk and really hands <br/>
on fun for the kids!<br/>
<br/>
P.P.S.  Question for Letterboxer2002.  What is the history behind your <br/>
personal stamp?  We saw that particular petrograph image on the glass wall <br/>
at the local bagel shop one morning.  Do you have anything to do with the <br/>
bagels?  We wish we would have known!  Then, we could have asked for you (an <br/>
exchange -- whoopee).  We could have also told you to tell the manager that <br/>
the small size cream cheese containers are way too small.  Single servings I <br/>
would say.  I am a generous cream cheese spreader.  Every toasted inch must <br/>
be covered with a smooth, opaque coat -- no bagel showing.  When the two <br/>
halves are reunited -- the cream cheese must properly ooze through the <br/>
little hole in the middle (on both sides) like a button.  Slurping out this <br/>
warm blob out is the best part!!  Just thought I would mention it...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Narnian!<br/>
One of my favorite parts of letterboxing is discovering all these hidden <br/>
treasures of green in our area!  We are very lucky in Fairfax County that <br/>
there are so many parks.  I guess this makes up for the personal property <br/>
taxes...<br/>
<br/>
We may be planting more boxes in parks where we have baseball practice.  It <br/>
gives Miss Ma and I something to do while Be is busy batting away.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your message!  BeMa<br/>
