Virginia. Happy 'boxing!<br/>
<br/>
All boxes were planted by M. Gainey on September 4, 2002, and all are <br/>
located in the City of Richmond's Southside<br/>
<br/>
Box #1: The Sled<br/>
THIS IS A MICRO BOX. YOU WILL NEED A MICRO STAMP TO STAMP INTO ITS <br/>
LOGBOOK. IT DOES NOT CONTAIN A PENCIL.<br/>
Park on Stonewall Avenue near the Holden Rhodes House. In the early <br/>
1800s, Holden Rhodes owned the land that we now call Forest Hill Park.<br/>
Stand with your back to the house door that opens onto Forest Hill <br/>
Avenue.<br/>
Begin walking toward the playground.<br/>
On your right as you walk across the open area, you will see a large, <br/>
twisted tree whose bark is falling off.<br/>
The first box is in this tree -- just don't get "strung out" finding <br/>
it!<br/>
