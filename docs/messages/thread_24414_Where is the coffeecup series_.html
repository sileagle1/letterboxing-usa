This is what I called the "Metra Rail Letterbox Crawl" and featured a bunch of boxes along one of the Chicago commuter routes.  I hoped others would jump on the bandwagon (or the train?) and place along the other rail lines.  My first box was "Sit-Sip-Stay-Box", but that location closed down (and they never returned my letterbox!!).  The three remaining "password protected" letterboxes are "Come Grumpy Go Happy" (ask for a spinach latte at Grumpy's ice cream shop), "Happy Apple" (ask for a happy apple at Lilette candies), and "Rock, Paper, Scissors" (ask to see the rock collection at the Paperie, a stationery store).  There are a few other more conventional clue-related boxes also along the RR line.<br/>
<br/>
I recently did something similar at the Great Lakes Gathering in Ohio...to get "Room Service" you had to ask the front desk staff at the hotel I stayed at if they had room service.  (That totally confused the one worker who was not told of the letterbox's existance...she thought people were playing a trick on her.)  Which reminds me...if anyone wants to borrow this one for an upcoming gathering, contact me offlist...it's available.<br/>
<br/>
I think I still have some pics of the original packaging of S-S-S-B, so let me know if you'd like to see it, C2B2.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is also a series in Anchorage Alaska called "Mexican Coffee Farmer's Series" planted by HomeSchoolMommy.  She directs you to the first coffee shop and provides a code in order to get the box.  Within the box is a clue to the next coffee shop.  It's not a walking tour - you need to drive, but also a thought...<br/>
