to find it and the "moose on the loose" hitch-hiker<br/>
some time ago last year on an extremely rainy, raw<br/>
spring morning. Now, where did that moose go? I hope<br/>
to be back letterboxing soon. The gathering at<br/>
Sleeping Giant sounds great! I will be sure to post it<br/>
as an outdoor activity at whatever EMS store I end up<br/>
working in in the next month or so. I'll even post it<br/>
on the EMS website (ah the power!). The LBNA website<br/>
already has a link to it from the EMS website under<br/>
the Waterford, CT and Buckland Hills, CT store pages.<br/>
