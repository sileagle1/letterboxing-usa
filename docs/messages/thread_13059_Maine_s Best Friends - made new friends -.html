Sternman &amp; Maine Genealogist went searching out for "Best Friends" in <br/>
Topsham.  We were travelling up Rt. 123 and went past "Skofield <br/>
Preserve" and someone was walking out.  1 hr. later we ran into <br/>
"phynstar" and partner at Best Friends.  They had just returned from <br/>
finding the Skofield box which we had planted last yr!  This is the <br/>
1st time we've met another Lb'er, and it was quite enjoyable.<br/>

Hopeing to get out again this weekend, but the rain keeps falling.<br/>

showing Mom around.  She loves this stuff.  On Sunday, we went back <br/>
to Skofield to view a flower near the box...I needed her opinion on <br/>
what it was (have bird book but no flower book...Hmmmm).  We agreed <br/>
that it is a Lady Slipper!! Also We saw Jack-in-the-Pulpits here <br/>

Sunday we went for Potts' Point when the rain broke and time alotted. <br/>

I'm so glad that you made new friends at "Best Friends".<br/>
We also checked out the Schofield Preserve one day last<br/>
week (can't remember which day) and came across a young<br/>
mother having a picnic with her children (the daughter <br/>
solemly warned us of the troll that lives under the bridge). We <br/>
enjoyed strolling through the woods and finding that box (didn't <br/>
have any trouble with the troll, either).<br/>
