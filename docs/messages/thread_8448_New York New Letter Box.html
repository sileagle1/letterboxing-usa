<p>Placed October 14, 2002 by the Lone Biker</p>
<p>Tawasentha Park                                                                                               Route 146                                                                                                  Guilderland New York</p>
<p>Easy, less than one hour; about a half mile.  But be careful in wet weather - the trails can be slippery!</p>
<p>Tawasentha Park, located on Route 146, is the largest Park in Guilderland. There are 213 acres of rolling terrain bisected by the Normanskill Creek.  The swimming pool facilities  are open from the last Saturday in June through Labor Day.  A pavilion is available for group activities, and must be reserved ahead of time. There are numerous picnic areas with tables and grills. There are also a playground and ball fields</p>
<p>The Park offers fishing, boating, trails for jogging and cross-country skiing, ice skating, sledding, basketball and tennis courts and playground areas. The Park is used by the local Little League, and by school cross-country teams.</p>
<p>I am very sorry to report that during the Summer, when the pool is open, non-residents must pay a $10:00 fee to park from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm.</p>
<p>Directions:  From Throughway (I-90) exit 24, take route 20 West for about 5 miles.  Turn Left on Route 146 towards Altamont; the park is on your left about one-half mile off route 20.</p>
<p>The letterbox:  Near the parking area near the pool and tennis/basketball courts there is a hill, climb the hill and at the top (after you look behind you to admire the view: GREAT SUNSETS!) bear right onto a path that takes you into the woods at the top of the hill.  Follow this path as it gradually descends.  The path will take a sharp right turn, and JUST BEFORE it does, look to your left for a poorly marked trail through a narrow strip of woods.  This will take you onto another trail.  Turn right and head downhill on this trail. On your left, just off the trail,  look for a very tall Oak Tree, with a stump attached.  Inside the stump is  the Box!  </p>
<p>After you replace the box, continue downhill to a very nice spot next to the Normanskill.  You have to go back up the way you came, but you can then go back to the first trail and follow it down to the Guilderland Performing Arts Center  (GPAC) Stage. Maybe you will put on an impromptu performance! In the Summer and early Fall the flowers in the Park on the path from the GPAC stage are especially beautiful. The trees in the park are always beautiful!  </p><p><br/></p><hr size="1"/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>
