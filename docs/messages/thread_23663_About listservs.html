At times, the list will turn be exactly what you wanted. But there might be 1200 people on it and the active posters happily talking off-topic.  <br/>
<br/>
It's something like subscribing to a magazine sight-unseen.  If you thought it was going to be like Conde Nast Traveler and it turns out to be more like Good Housekeeping (or vice versa), do you write a letter to the editor, or do you cancel your subscription and look for the one that's right for you?<br/>
<br/>
As I said, I'm also new, and have no idea whether the thread in question is typical of this list or a rare abberation.  I do think the volume might be too much for me, so with a few more days' evaluation, I'll make the decision whether to stay on and deal with the volume or unsub.  But all the old listers can happily talk away--it's not their job to make me happy!<br/>

The host service for the letterboxing.org website terminated the <br/>
site unexpectedly. People are now discussing options for helping the <br/>
volunteers who run the site foot the estimated $600 per year fee for <br/>
a dedicated server.<br/>
<br/>
A discussion of how to get LbNA back online and the quickest method <br/>
to do that, whether PayPal or otherwise, could be considered on <br/>
topic at the moment.<br/>

If the volume of messages is overwhelming, you can opt to only <br/>

you only have to read the ones that interest you.<br/>

<br/>
  i have been involved in some flames here, but please forgive me for showing my over caring for the safety for our fellow letterboxing community. this community has been there for me when times got rough and i feel that i should do my part to make sure well all stay informed. some people haven't been as lucky to get roughed up by paypal. good for them, but the warning had to be thrown out there. just as a precaution.<br/>

  every magazine has a bad issue once in awhile. we all deal with it.<br/>

<br/>
I hope you haven't unsubscribed yet.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes opinions come across more forcefully or harsh in print than <br/>
they were meant.<br/>
<br/>
So, please understand that I am trying to offer my thoughts in a <br/>
gentle and caring manner.<br/>
<br/>
I understood your concern when you first responded to the many emails <br/>
regarding paypal.  Many of us belong to several groups/lists and <br/>
don't have time to "wade through" off subject topics.<br/>
<br/>
And, you did not realize that there was a specific subject <br/>
(contributing to LbNA) that this all related to.  Why should you?  If <br/>
you had gone back in the thread, you would have seen it, but again, <br/>
why would you think to do this on that particular subject?<br/>
<br/>
I hope that you don't unsubscribe but simply check back to this group <br/>
in about 3 weeks.  We will most likely be back on track.<br/>
<br/>
Again, this is for you just a "bad issue" of a wonderful magazine.<br/>
<br/>
I notice from your profile that you are in Delaware.  I live in <br/>
Portland, Oregon.  I would like to extend an invitation to visit <br/>
sometime and go LBing with me.<br/>
<br/>
Here's hoping you stay with us.<br/>
