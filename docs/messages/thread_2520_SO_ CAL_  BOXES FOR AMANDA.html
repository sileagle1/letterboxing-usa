<div>HOWDY,  We have a special fondness for Orcas 
so here's some hints, rent a car, do a quickie overview of Knott's ( it was a 
lot better when it was an Ol West Frontier venue) and letter box with the rest 
of your time. Public trans. is dismal and to get to the boxes you do need your 
own wheels, plus local maps. Real close to Buena Park just down Highway 39 is 
Huntington Beach so head there first, turning right onto Pacific Coast Highway 
(101).  Bolsa Chica Nature Preserve is on your right after driving through 
Huntington Beach, pull in to small lot.  
Then head into Los Angeles County to Long Beach on 101, turn right on Bellflower 
Blvd, then a quick right onto 7th St and a short block to Cal State Long Beach- 
2 boxes there.  Next, El Dorado Nature Center, (open til 4 or so), north on 
Palo Verde, right on Spring before 605 Freeway.</div>
<div>Then drive west on Spring  to Cherry, turn 
left and left at signal just after Home Depot.  This takes you to Signal 
Hill smack in the middle of Long Beach.   From there take Cherry south 
towards ocean, turn right on Ocean Ave. and follow signs to Shore Line Village, 
across from Queen Mary for  White by Day and Blue at Night.   
Finally if you have time and strength, Wendy Gault's box in Palos Verdes would 
make a super sunset find.   Our boxes are fairly easy distances and 
locations.  We really don't have the open spaces to get in a good hike in 
the city.</div>
<div>Hope you have fun on your visit, watch out for 
traffic!  We are eager to find some of your boxes when we can get up your 
way.  Gwen and Don  </div>

I lived in the Westminster/Garden Grove area for a year and 1/2 when I<br/>
was a kid and the transit system was abysmal then.  I was just hoping it<br/>
might have gotten better.  Maybe I'll print clues off and use my<br/>
persuasive powers somehow and be able to achieve at least one box.<br/>
Sunday will be our only "free" day.  Saturday will be devoted to the log<br/>
ride over and over and over if I have my way!<br/>

I was going to Atlanta this weekend, and don't intend to do any car-<br/>
renting while I'm there.  However, a stroke of brilliance hit me: <br/>
Rent a bike!  Mobiled impaired folks like us need to get creative <br/>
while out on our adventures.  =)<br/>
<br/>
I think a bike would get you to Medieval Times just fine.  ;o)<br/>

<br/>
How is it you get to travel so much?  Is this for business?  I want a<br/>
job like you've got, Buster!  Renting bikes is an EXCELLENT idea.  I<br/>
might see about that!  AND the boyfriend is liking the Medeival (sp?)<br/>
Times idea, so that may be a go.  We shall see!  They have food there,<br/>
right? I've been to the Renaissance Faire in Bristol, Wisconsin and have<br/>
seen a joust, so I'm familiar with that type of deal, somewhat.  It<br/>
sounds like it will be a new adventure for him.  <br/>
<br/>
We may be visiting some relatives of his and I told him maybe they could<br/>
drive us around and we could introduce them to Letterboxing -- WHAT A<br/>
GREAT IDEA!  We'll see if I can use my charms to persuade him on that,<br/>
or else maybe I'll e-mail his relations and ask them if they would like<br/>
to pick us up then take a stroll with us to Bolsa Chica Nature Park.<br/>
This may be possible after all.  We just have to get a little creative<br/>
here.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Don &amp; Gwen and Ryan for your helpful suggestions!<br/>

<br/>
*chuckle*  It's funny you would say that, because I was thinking just <br/>
that thing about others on this talk list.  =)  But I have a typical <br/>
9-to-5 job working 40 hours a week and do my traveling mostly on <br/>
weekends.  In this case, my Atlanta/Africa trip is a two-week <br/>
vacation.  I rarely get a chance to travel THAT far!  <br/>
However, I have gotten a couple of nice trips to Arizona over the <br/>
last year and a half complements of Intel.  (That's where I work--<br/>
Intel.)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; They have food there, right? <br/>
<br/>
They most certainly do.  However, being Medieval Times and all, they <br/>
don't provide silverware.  Prepare to feast like a slob!  =)<br/>
