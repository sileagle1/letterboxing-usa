For me, this naturally involves hiking boots and possibly Rubbermaid.<br/>
I'm pleased to report that El Pio Solo, La Caja de Oro and Las<br/>
Palbras Viejas are all fine and have had a number of visitors since I<br/>
was there in the spring. La Piedra Rosa was missing but has been<br/>
replaced. Most of the visitors were from afar but there appears to be<br/>
a letterboxing family on the loose from Albuquerque. C'mon, plant a<br/>
box! I was unable to check on my other boxes but I did leave two new<br/>
boxes in my wake, clues to follow. <br/>
<br/>
I took a day to hunt down the one Mystery Box in the fine state. This<br/>
involved driving through sixteen miles of mud, fording a stream and<br/>
eating really bad food. Unfortunately, the Ancestral Pueblo box was<br/>
not on my list of successes for the day. I know I was in the right<br/>
place but unless it takes a backhoe to "scratch around the edge" the<br/>
box has vanished. Oh well, the clue was clever, the location was on my<br/>
life list of must sees and I didn't need a tow truck to get out of the<br/>
mud. Such is letterboxing. Funhog<br/>
