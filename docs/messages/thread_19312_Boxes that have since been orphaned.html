I totally agree and have just created a DATABASE that can be added to <br/>
by all members to list boxes for adoption, yours if you cannot <br/>
maintain (out of state, covered in poison ivy, etc) or if you have <br/>
made several unsuccessful attempts (over weeks, not over the weekend) <br/>
to contact placer on the .org site, then add it to the list.  If you <br/>
are a kind and gentile soul wanting to adopt, pick one and post your <br/>
name and adoption date.  The email column can be optional, but then <br/>
how will you get the congratulations due a new adopter? <br/>
<br/>
Will this work?<br/>

<br/>
Being new to this hobby, I've been under the impression that the vast <br/>
majority of boxes are owned -- either by the placer or by an <br/>
adopter.  I think such ownership should be a given requirement.  If <br/>
someone can't care for a box they've placed in another state or <br/>
because they're getting away from letterboxing, then that orphaned <br/>
box should be adopted by someone else or removed.<br/>
<br/>
For those who are raising the point that a box listed as MIA might <br/>
not be missing, I'm not talking about those situations.  I'm talking <br/>
about boxes that are confirmed missing by the placer but remain in <br/>
the database or orphaned boxes that are MIA -- meaning the placer <br/>
never follows up to see if the box is really missing and no adoptive <br/>
party does either.  This latter situation speaks to ownership.  I <br/>
don't think it too hard to imagine that 5 or 10 years from now if a <br/>
bunch of boxes that are supposedly MIA are never confirmed still in <br/>
place by their placers or owners we'll have a database full of ghost <br/>
letterboxes -- and thus virtually useless to us.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps LbNA could consider a system by which lack of placer <br/>
confirmation results in a box being listed as MIA and after a certain <br/>
number of independent 'boxers fail to find it that it then be <br/>
removed.  Of course, that requires more administration of the <br/>
database than currently exists, so I don't know the best solution.<br/>
<br/>
Let me use an example.  This American Life letterbox was placed in <br/>
the Public Garden in Boston by a letterboxer from Baltimore while in <br/>
Boston on vacation.  The box was reported missing on 1/8/2004 and the <br/>
site was updated as such.  Since then, at least 3 other letterboxers <br/>
have also not found the letterbox -- judging from who they were I <br/>
think it rather probable that the box is, in fact, gone.  However, it <br/>
seems apparent that this box is orphaned -- the placers from <br/>
Baltimore can't confirm the missing box and no one in the Boston area <br/>
has become it's adoptive owner.  So it sits in the database.  Now, in <br/>
this instance, at least it says "MIA".<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my thoughts.<br/>
<br/>

As long as the clue lists the box as MIA -- or something to that <br/>
effect (reported missing but not confirmed, etc.), I'd be fine with <br/>
it.  My issue is the boxes that are MIA but the database doesn't say <br/>
that.  Or, for example, the Eastern State Peniteniary box which <br/>
is "presumed missing" by the placer since August 1, 2003 -- 11 months <br/>
ago -- without any confirmation of actually missing or not.  In that <br/>
case, the clue listed in the database didn't say MIA.<br/>

sewbiz - nice job.  I have just entered my two boxes which I placed <br/>
while on travel.  Both have been recently found, although Roaming <br/>
Around has a tendency to wash out down onto the road (clues updated) <br/>

&gt; I think such ownership should be a given requirement.  If<br/>
&gt; someone can't care for a box they've placed in another state or<br/>
&gt; because they're getting away from letterboxing, then that orphaned<br/>
&gt; box should be adopted by someone else or removed.<br/>
<br/>
That particular concept may work well for places like New England where you can't walk out your door without tripping over a letterbox and 1/10 of the population are letterboxers but out here in the West, boxers are relatively few and far between.  There are many fantastic boxes in very unique places that would have to be pulled according to your recommendation.<br/>
<br/>
Another option would be one of the following:  Mark GPS coords for where the box had been planted.  That way, if there are repeated reports of a missing box, someone with a GPSr can go straight to the spot (or pretty darn close) and confirm.  This has a few drawbacks -<br/>
1) Not everyone has a GPSr<br/>
2) There are many conditions where a GPSr won't get a good reading on location (i.e. canyons, around tall buildings, under thick plant cover)<br/>
3) It seems a lot like geocaching and I can see it being abused to pump up F counts for those who may not want to work for a box.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that might work is to take a photo of the exact spot the box has been placed.  That can be a way to confirm that the searcher was in the correct spot.<br/>
<br/>
Conversely, the finders could take a picture and ask for confirmation that they were looking in the right spot.<br/>

Photo - good idea - I take a photo at the time of placement so a week <br/>
or more later when I am writing the clues I can remember where I put <br/>
it and the nature of the surrounding area.  Heck, I have even taken <br/>
photos of the location where I couldn't find a box so I can email the <br/>
placer to confirm I was in the right spot.  And if I was and the box <br/>
was definitely not there --- the photo becomes my 'F' count -- or <br/>

I'm in Central CT and VERY new to letterboxing.  I've only been at it a week.  If the box that needs checking on in CT is within a 1/2 hour or so, I may be able to check on it when I get back from vacation.<br/>

I've actually done this recently.  Camera Obscura said that he would have his <br/>
BIG Virgin box back in within a week after the June 5th Trail Day gather.  <br/>
However, when Bluebird and I checked on it exactly a week later, it still wasn't <br/>
replanted.  I happened to have my new and oh so cool digital camera with me <br/>
and I took a picture of the place where I thought it was supposed to be hidden. <br/>
 I then sent him via e-mail a copy of the picture (I was close enough to the <br/>
hiding spot where I didn't need an arrow or anything), and (he apologized for <br/>
not getting it out on time) he was able to tell me that I was in the correct <br/>
spot.  That way, when we went back, it was there and we didn't have to search <br/>
too hard because we knew we were in the correct spot.<br/>

count as a find.  I've got to find the material evidence of its <br/>
existance for it to count!  =)<br/>

My rule when it comes to counting boxes: If it FEELS like it should <br/>
be counted, I count it.  And try not to be too critical if someone <br/>
else thinks differently about the subject--there are grey areas that <br/>
just aren't worth the effort to fight over.  *shrug*  =)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Shortly after I started letterboxing two years ago, a box in this <br/>
area lost its stamp to geo-trinkets.  The question was raised on the <br/>
list as to whether finding the stampless box was an "F" and the FAQ <br/>
was cited, defining an "F" as being a complete stamp exchange.  So <br/>
the FAQ may have changed at some point, but it has read this way for <br/>
the past 2 years.<br/>
<br/>
But, that was back when I was anal about my numbers.  I think when <br/>
you are new at something you tend to look for some tangible way to <br/>
define it and measure your success.  The funny thing is, I ended up <br/>
adopting this box since it was near my house and the original placer <br/>
was no longer an active 'boxer.  I carved a new stamp and have since <br/>
then done maintenance on it.  Not an "F", not a "P", just one of <br/>
those things you do in the spirit of the game.<br/>

&gt; often I find a letterbox without a stamp!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But just finding the hiding spot isn't good enough by my standards <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; count as a find.  I've got to find the material evidence of its <br/>
&gt; existance for it to count!  =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My rule when it comes to counting boxes: If it FEELS like it <br/>
should <br/>
&gt; be counted, I count it.  And try not to be too critical if someone <br/>
&gt; else thinks differently about the subject--there are grey areas <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; just aren't worth the effort to fight over.  *shrug*  =)<br/>

&gt; Carpe diem!<br/>
