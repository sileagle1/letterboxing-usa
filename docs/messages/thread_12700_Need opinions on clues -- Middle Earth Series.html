I enjoyed reading the clues.  Most of them didn't look too difficult to<br/>
decipher.  There were a couple that I wasn't sure where to start figuring<br/>
out how to translate, but I would find it with a little work.  I liked your<br/>
creative ideas. It made them fun. I also love the series, being into Tolkein<br/>
myself.  Pity there's no opportunity in the near future to head out to CA.<br/>
If I do though, I'll hunt them out for you.<br/>

<br/>
We are newbies ( 8 F so far!) in So. Cal, but I just wanted to weigh in on <br/>
your clues.  Please, don't change them!  While we have enjoyed the simple <br/>
clues we've attempted so far, our favorite has been the one that had some <br/>
spice to the clues.  In any case, all of your clues are written in very <br/>
simple substitution codes, the keys to which are easily available online or <br/>
in a library (but isn't online so much faster?).  Frankly, we'd love to see <br/>
more challenging "puzzle-y" clues become more common.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure that infrequent visitation is a sign of the difficulty of the <br/>
clue or the box.  We've just returned from our cross-country trip, and we <br/>
managed to have four first finds, all of which were simple drivebys.   I <br/>
think it reflects that old saying:  the three most important aspects are <br/>
location, location, location!   For us,a  Middle Earth themed series may just <br/>
make it worth the long drive up to San Luis Obispo.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents worth!<br/>

bad and I didn't have the time for a long drive to the next nearest <br/>
unfound box, I spent a pleasant two afternoons solving all of your <br/>
puzzles.  Having deciphered the codes, I believe I could collect the <br/>
entire series of stamps in one afternoon were I in California.<br/>
<br/>
I consider straight forward directions easy, ciphers like your <br/>
moderate, and foreign language puzzles like Pete and Wanda's <br/>
difficult.  Call it 3 out of 5 stars for difficulty.<br/>

If you guys decide to do the drive up to San Louis drop me an email and let me know, maybe we could all meet for coffee or lunch somewhere and do and exchange.... <br/>
<br/>
I know that Sir Balthazar, Ash Raven, JuggglerMouse and I are all in the nearby area... could make for some nice exchange numbers that day!<br/>
