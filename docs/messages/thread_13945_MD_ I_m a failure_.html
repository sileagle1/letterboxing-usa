                    <div class="plaintext-content">I tell you, I've had the WORST luck hunting down boxes on the AT.  First there was the one in Gathland State Park (a VERY cool park, btw, although I'd like to complain about the lack of trash cans).  I arrived rather late--nearly 8:00pm, and didn't have much time to look for it.  Me, without a flashlight, needed to get to a shelter and set up camp pronto!<br/>
<br/>
But I did stop briefly.  The arch was obvious, but the second dip wasn't.  The second dip in the trail?  The second dip in the wall?  I didn't see anything I'd really call a 'dip' per se, and ended up just looking under every flat rock I could find near the arch.  No luck, I failed.  Darkness was approaching, and I needed to get a move on before I could do a thorough search.<br/>
<br/>
Then there was the Washington Monument letterbox--another very cool and bizarre place.  This box I'm convinced is missing, because I found the tree with the blaze, and another split tree on the other side of the trail.  Found a bunch of suspicious looking rocks and an indentation in the ground where it looked like a letterbox might once have been.<br/>
<br/>
I sadly concluded that the box must be missing.  As a consolation, I hid a letterbox in the nook of that tree with the white blaze mentioned in the clue, but it just wasn't the same.<br/>
<br/>
I'm now nearly out of Maryland (0.2 miles to Pennsylvania) and can only say that my skills as a letterboxer are quickly deteriorating!<br/>

The AT skirts Greenbrier, and we must have just missed you! All <br/>
3 boxes found and in good shape. Beautiful books and stamps. <br/>
You could always go back and get them ;-)<br/>

Prepositions and prepositional phrases can be a bit confusing. <br/>
Bookworm states "in" or "on" the wall...pick one... this should have <br/>
been an easy find.<br/>

Dips can be difficult to spot while hunting in the woods at dusk.;)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">!Oh, NO!  After touring the Hocking Hills of SE Ohio, visiting caves <br/>
and hiking the Grandma Gatewood Trail while waiting to meet up with <br/>
Pete the next day for letterboxing and the gathering in eastern PA, I <br/>
actually took a dip down into Maryland just on the off chance that I <br/>
might run into Ryan on the AT! It was too late in the day to go to <br/>
ATC HQ , so I hung out and did the boxes at Gathland just north of <br/>
Harpers Ferry. Quite a few other hikers came through while I was <br/>
there, and almost every one of them, with eyes fixated on the white <br/>
blazes, would probably have missed the smaller, less obvious arch <br/>
near the mausoleum had I not pointed it out to them - even though it <br/>
was less than 50 feet off the trail! Too bad that Ryan missed that <br/>
spot, too, since I left a little hitcher there that I thought would <br/>
go nicely with his turtle! (Perhaps someone else can try to get it to <br/>
him up the trail, if he's not moving too fast!) And -who knows- maybe <br/>
we'll still meet him up in CT! There are hundreds of hikers coming <br/>
through right now - I must have seen at least 2 dozen while crossing <br/>
both the DWG and Bear Mt. bridges on my way home, so there's <br/>
definitely a lot of them out this year! Happy trails to all!<br/>
