website.<br/>
<br/>
Under "What's New", the series "Murder in Gabriel Park!" (that does <br/>
include the exclaimation mark--it's more exciting that way) has Rick <br/>
as the person who hid it.  I'm not sure who Rick is, but I know I hid <br/>
it, and my name isn't Rick.  It's Ryan.  =)<br/>
<br/>
The site says it was last updated Oct 5th, but two of the letterboxes <br/>
I've hidden before then don't show up:  The mystery box "Temple of <br/>
Terror" (hidden Sept 29th) and "Ramona Falls" (hidden Sept 16th).<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm...  Yep, I think that's it.  Thanks!<br/>
