                    <div class="plaintext-content">FYI - When I wrote my Midlife crisis story, I put it in a Word document<br/>
along with the scans for my own use and records.  I only wanted to share the<br/>
text with the group.  When I copied and pasted I didn't initially realize<br/>
that the images came over too, until it was too late.  I'm equally concerned<br/>
about not publishing the images unless the placer chooses to do it himself.<br/>
Displaying the "Stone Needle in NJ" mystery box would give away the<br/>
location.   Sorry!<br/>
<br/>
As for the off road time, I still think it's not a problem to at least<br/>
specify the following categories:<br/>
<br/>
1. Driveby (DB): meaning:  Very near  the road or parking area.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Short walk (ShW): Less than an hour<br/>
<br/>
3.  Long walk (LW): 2 to 3 hours<br/>
<br/>
4.  Extended hike (EH): 1/2 day plus<br/>
<br/>
Another angle has also occurred to me.  It's just as important to let the<br/>
searcher know that they'll always be close to the car as not.  I'm updating<br/>
Stone Needle to include the statement that the searcher should never be more<br/>
than a few minutes from a parking lot.  If there's a clue that only says to<br/>
look for a landmark with no distance, a searcher may miss and go in a long<br/>
direction.<br/>
<br/>
As I already stated, I knew the chances I was taking and my little adventure<br/>
on Saturday was no one else's fault but my own.  That was the whole "Midlife<br/>
Crisis" connection.  However, my plea is one of compassion for the<br/>
greenhorn.  Just because your right isn't going to bring a hypothermia<br/>
victim back to life.  Also, from my business law courses, I know that<br/>
disclaimers are not always foolproof.  They have their limitations.  If<br/>
you're the worse driver in the world, plastering your car with signs that<br/>
say, "Not responsible for any accidents that happen with this car" isn't<br/>
going to do you much good.  If somebody perishes in the woods while<br/>
searching for a box with your name and address in it or with clues from your<br/>
website on their person, see what good those disclaimers will do for you!  A<br/>
good lawyer can drill holes through any disclaimer.<br/>
<br/>
Government land managers are very hypersensitive about liability.  If a<br/>
casualty or accident occurs with the with the slightest connection to<br/>
letterboxing they will hunt them down and destroy them.  They will also fine<br/>
anyone they catch doing it.  I alluded to this in April in the "Letterboxing<br/>
in National Parks" Thread.  I just heard a story about a man who was walking<br/>
through the Gettysburg Monument with his head down watching where he was<br/>
going.  A Park Ranger accused him of looking for artifacts and gave him a<br/>
$100 fine.  Don't think, it isn't possible for letterboxing to be declared<br/>
an incompatible activity.  Remember, Government agencies and their law<br/>
systems are the hardest of all to fight.<br/>
<br/>
I was YCC camp director at a state park one summer.  We had a very<br/>
liability-conscious superintendent.  You'd be surprised at all the seemingly<br/>
harmless activities that were curtailed because of it.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since I wrote my suggestions for letterboxing on public lands, I've<br/>
seen nothing concrete come of it.  Just some "warm fuzzy" lip service.  If<br/>
you're looking for a hobby the requires no accountability, you should<br/>
consider collecting postage stamps and not the ones in letterboxes.<br/>
