I'm a fairly casual letterboxer, and although I enjoy doing it, I don't keep very good  track of my F's P's etc, and don't even have all my images in an orderly fashion.  I also enjoy geocaching, although I have placed only one cache. That cache has been found about 60 times since I planted it a year ago, and has been vandalized three or four times. Some kind 'cacher has always found the remains and done their best to return the cache to it's original condition and location.<br/>
The same is true of the 6 or so letterboxes I've planted. Sometimes they turn up missing, get chewed by critters or are vandalized.<br/>
 I don't take it personally. I just figure someone just happened across them and decided to have some fun at my expense.  I can just picture a group of teenaged kids poking around with a stick, finding a plastic box with "stuff" in it, and laughing uproariously (is that a word?) as they scatter the stuff around and fill it with dirt or sticks, or worse!<br/>
A couple of times a fellow 'boxer has found the vandalized boxes and repaired them if possible, just as the 'chachers have done.<br/>
I know that when I place the boxes/caches I am taking the chance that something will happen to them. I do it anyway, because I enjoy the experience of planning, carving and placing the items as well as the great feeling of my own finds, and hope to duplicate that experience for someone else.<br/>

No, I can absolutely assure you that mischief was at hand with the <br/>
boxes in Carlisle proper.<br/>
<br/>
ALL of the boxes in Thornwald park were taken from their hiding spots <br/>
and either tossed beside the trial or hidden in other places. Some <br/>
were filled with leaf debris. All the stamps, save one box, were <br/>
stolen from the boxes along with the logbooks. I don't know how <br/>
anyone can see these boxes in the shape they were in and think <br/>
otherwise. <br/>
<br/>
The one box you found in that park was returned to it's original <br/>
hiding spot (after being found quite a distance away tossed beside <br/>
the trail) by my daughter and I before I decided that I would pull <br/>
the clues to the series. These boxes were in this park for a long <br/>
time before this happened. Never had ALL of them been 'discovered' <br/>
by what might be the casual observer.One box maybe, but all? Think <br/>
what you may, I know what we found.<br/>
<br/>
The Boiling Spring boxes and the last Thornwald box have been pulled. <br/>
All clues are deleted so no one will be disappointed in searching for <br/>
something that is not there. Thank you for the suggestion. They will <br/>
NOT be replaced. <br/>
