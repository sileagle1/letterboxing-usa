<br/>So???? Maybe some people don' t mind.  I certainly didn't mind these posts.  Actually, even though I'm not into the "numbers" as much, it was interesting that someone actually went and counted the numbers on the site.  I was pleasantly surprised of some in the top 5 (Oregon for one).  Of course, I already knew that I lived in the Letterboxing Capitol of America!

Hey, I'm trying my best to boost WA's count (come to think of it, <br/>
I've placed a few in CA, too)!!!  Oh, I also placed one in OH <br/>
recently which isn't yet reflected in their count so they're a bit <br/>
closer to CT than most people think!  ;)  I've run out of local <br/>
places here in my WA neighborhood to hide them without duplicating <br/>
my efforts...  ;)  But, then again, I have been 'duplicating' my <br/>
efforts, anyway--having to rehide so many of my boxes that have gone <br/>
missing recently!  UGH!  <br/>
<br/>
Hey, Washingtonians...let's catch up with Oregon!  If every active <br/>
letterboxer just placed a new box within the next month, that would <br/>
get us pretty close... ;)  Or, better yet, spread the cheer around <br/>
the world and drop off a new hitchhiker in the next week or two <br/>
instead!  We need something to look forward to during our 'gray' <br/>
period here in the Pacific NW...<br/>
<br/>
In all seriousness--no, it's not about the numbers just getting out <br/>
and doing something that is really a lot of fun, doesn't require <br/>
much money, helps us burn some calories, relieve some stress, <br/>
exposes us to new, exciting and different experiences &amp; keeps us <br/>
from eating junk food or spending money we don't need to spend!!!  <br/>
And for those of us who harbor obsessive/compulsive tendencies like <br/>
I do, the stamps are nice to help us document what we've <br/>
accomplished along the way...  <br/>

many boxes a State has? For me, letterboxing adds a new dimesion to <br/>

arrogant, however, I'm sure this does not seem arrogant to others who <br/>
enjoy keeping track of someone's trivial, statistical information. <br/>
After all, what difference does it make how many boxes you have <br/>
found? So....we get a letterbox patch?......The numbers really don't <br/>
mean much to me at all. If the numbers are important, maybe we should <br/>
develop some type of weighted scale. Based on the statistics, if you <br/>
use the "Connecticut Standard" then maybe for each box found in <br/>
Virginia could count as 4 found!<br/>

I think this is getting a bit ridiculous!I go letterboxing for the <br/>
added adventure on a great hike. Is it just a numbers game for you?<br/>

(this ain't a flame ... figured I needed a disclaimer :-))<br/>
<br/>
&gt; It certainly does seem like a numbers game. Does it really matter how<br/>
&gt; many boxes a State has? <br/>
<br/>
It might be.  Depends who you ask.  Isn't life about turning money into <br/>
time and time into fun?<br/>
<br/>
It might be, but on a more interesting note, the quantum physicists have<br/>
pretty much destroyed objective reality in favor of observer-centric <br/>
specific reality -- in other words, the answer to the question "if a tree<br/>
falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound", <br/>
is "no".  (That one had been bugging alot of people for a long time).<br/>
<br/>
What this means to letterboxing, I guess (or at least to "these" sorts of<br/>
threads on letterboxing talk lists), is that (and quoting Mr. Brett's punk <br/>
band) "you create your own reality, and leave mine to me" (good to know the <br/>
punk rockers figured it out before the scientists and the philosophers ... <br/>
tho at least its good to know the singer is a PhD candidate ...)<br/>
<br/>
In other words, I think most people who are posting on this thread think<br/>
its fun, especially given the rather lame letterboxing weather in parts<br/>
of the world from whence the posts are coming ... (including my part of<br/>
the world, where I stare at 9 hand-carved stamps waiting to get into<br/>
the latest caper) ...<br/>
<br/>
... and if its competitive and competitive is fun, so be it, we can create<br/>
our own reality in which this stuff goes to our brain's equivalent of <br/>
/dev/null ...<br/>
<br/>
As for weighted scales, I think a box should be worth one point for each <br/>
month it remains unfound.  Anyone want to keep track of that?  I didn't <br/>
think so -- I think that proves the point that its not competitive, or <br/>
people would be proposing all sorts of rules along these lines to "level <br/>
the playing field", etc. which is what people into competition start to<br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, and to really stoke the flames -- I've always felt its a form of<br/>
competition to deny the competitive nature of the human race, or to show<br/>
disdain for apparent competition (whether or not it is in fact, competition),<br/>
which, in this case, I don't think it is.  I call it "Tooheyism"; I'll leave<br/>
it to the interested to work out the allusion, tho I'll claim the first<br/>
post on the list alluding to quantum physics, semiotics, punk rock, and<br/>
fiction -- not because I'm competitive, but because its fun :-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You know, it's strange, but I can't recall ANYONE saying they think <br/>
letterboxing is a numbers game.  The fact that some people enjoy <br/>
tracking statistic doesn't mean they think letterboxing is all about <br/>
the numbers, either.<br/>
<br/>
Consequently, this whole discussion about numbers is pretty silly.  <br/>
As far as I can tell, everyone on this board agrees that it's the <br/>
hiking, getting out doors, and enjoying yourself while hunting down <br/>
the box that counts.  Some like the additional enjoyment of playing <br/>
with numbers, but if you're not one of them, why should it bother you <br/>
that others do?  I don't get upset because other people like to <br/>
mountain bike while I don't.  I don't throw a fit because some people <br/>
love to surf but I have no interest in it.  Doesn't hurt me any.  Let <br/>
them have at it!<br/>
<br/>
Number are fun.  I enjoy them.  I like to see what states have the <br/>
most letterboxes--more out of curiosity than any real <br/>
competitiveness.  I like to hear how many letterboxes people nab.  <br/>
Granted, I don't want a day-by-day account with updates everytime <br/>
someone finds a new one--a rough estimate is fine.  Which is what MY <br/>
counts usually are--rough estimates that I update every now and then.<br/>
<br/>
On a road trip to Yellowstone, I drove 3,217 miles.  Why do I know <br/>
that?  Because I noted the odometer before I left and then when I <br/>
arrived.  Why does it matter?  It doesn't.  Just interesting trivia.  <br/>
And makes me look authoritative when I write down such numbers.  =)<br/>
<br/>
But I think everyone likes to track numbers that really don't matter <br/>
a whole lot.  How many of you folks bought a stock that you plan to <br/>
hold for years--but you check its stock price every day to learn if <br/>
it went up or down by a nickel because Alan Greenspan coughed?  How <br/>
many of you folks check the basketball scores?  Or football scores?  <br/>
How many people followed the home run battle between Mark McGuire and <br/>
Sammy Sosa?  I don't even like baseball, but even I was caught up in <br/>
the moment.<br/>
<br/>
How many people wanted to do something "extra-special" to celebrate <br/>
the ringing in of the year 2000?  There's something magical about <br/>
watching those nines all turn into zeros.  How many people have <br/>
watched their odometer turn from 99999 back to 00000?  Heck, I get <br/>
excited when it turned from 85000 to 86000.  (I'm easily amused, I <br/>
admit it!)<br/>
<br/>
Does any of this have any great cosmic significance?  Of course not.  <br/>
But but it's not hurting anyone or anything either.  And I think <br/>
everyone probably plays this game to some degree.  <br/>
<br/>
However, if you don't like to play that game, there's nothing wrong <br/>
with that either.  But I *DO* think there's something wrong with <br/>
trying to stop other people from playing and enjoying the game, <br/>
though.<br/>
