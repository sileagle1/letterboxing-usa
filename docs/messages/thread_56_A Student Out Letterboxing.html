Daniel &amp; All,<br/>
<br/>
This past Saturday I introduced a student to letterboxing as part of a<br/>
unit.  Stephen Kwietniak is a "Quest" student who has shown an interest in<br/>
a navigation course I have been putting together for a couple years.  The<br/>
first assignment was to read the Smithsonian article.  Assignment #2 was to<br/>
locate the website and find the clues to the letterboxes behind Skyview<br/>
High School.  The third was to print up the clues and bring them Saturday<br/>
morning to the coffee shop (Kaladi Bros. Coffee).<br/>
<br/>
Stephen showed up with his uncle.  We did a "compass class" for 30 minutes,<br/>
then drove out to the trails.  Stephen had his clues off the Internet site<br/>
and with them he found his first letterbox.   That was the fifth assignment<br/>
after the compass class.  He was pretty wound about it and had some great<br/>
questions including making his own letterbox and writing up the clues<br/>
himself.  I told him that would be great and we would include his letterbox<br/>
in with the Alaskan letterboxes. It was a brisk morning walk of about a<br/>
mile and a half, we saw spruce grouse and had a very good time.  Mary Ellen<br/>
and the three girls went along as well.<br/>
<br/>
He will now make a quadrant to find latitude, then read "Longitude" a great<br/>
book, then get into other aspects of navigation.  The magnetic compass is<br/>
where we started and this exercise provided a great activity to use what<br/>
was learned, with the history behind it in the article.<br/>
<br/>
This was a great exercise and Stephen was a very good subject to try this<br/>
out on.  Next year we will probably have the entire 8th grade finding<br/>
letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone approached Brunton, Silva or any other compass company about<br/>
students getting some break when they purchase a compass?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  keep young people in mind like you are.  The web site is truly a<br/>
great one, easy to use, great maps, the whole thing is very well done.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Best regards<br/>
