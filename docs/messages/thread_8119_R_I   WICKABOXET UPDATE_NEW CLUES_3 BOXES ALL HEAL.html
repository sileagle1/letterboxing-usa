2 BOXES(firetower and rattlesnake ledge)PLUS 1 BOX (THE FOX BOX) IN <br/>
THE SAME AREA.3 BOXES IN A 2.5 MI LOOP.<br/>
<br/>
A pleasent stroll on woods roads in an area that has been almost <br/>
forgotten,one of the most quiet places in R.I.This hike is an easy2.5 <br/>
miles over 2 hours or less and is great for the whole family(grandma <br/>
and grandpa included).There are 2 boxes on this hike.From RI rt.102 <br/>
in west greenwich,just north of I-95 exit 5,follow Plain Meetinghouse <br/>
Rd for about 3 miles.Park at the Wickaboxet Management Area lot on <br/>
your right hand side.Make sure to wear blaze orange in hunting <br/>
season,Oct-Feb.<br/>
<br/>
Pass through the gate at the parking area,follow old road north-<br/>
northeast,and soon bear left at a fork in the road for a clockwise <br/>
loop through a forest that is recovering nicely from a huge fire in <br/>
the 1960"s.This area is also said to have been used as a native <br/>
american camp in colonial times.<br/>
<br/>
After about 0.3 miles,go sharply right(south)at an intersection <br/>
before quickly turning left,(southeast)along another park road.Begin <br/>
passing some low ledge in the trees to the north,with scattered <br/>
boulders under the cliffs.Fork left(north)and climb the road to the <br/>
site of an old fire tower.From the footings,follow a path at 300 deg <br/>
to pass a blocky waist high boulder on your left.You'll soon come to <br/>
a nicely balanced glacial erratic on the ledge.The ridgeline path <br/>
piddles out some,but continue to bushwack along the ledge to the <br/>
second glacial erratic,the firetower letterbox is tucked under the <br/>
northern overhang of this boulder...<br/>
<br/>
stamp in and then head back to the firetower footings,head back down <br/>
the gravel rd. pass the road to your right(the road you came in on)<br/>
continue straight on your way to the rattlesnake ledge.Walk straight <br/>
for approx.1.0 miles(to include the fox box look for a path at 180deg <br/>
and  follow the fox clues)for the rattlesnake continue straight until <br/>
you see the large ledge looming on your right.Turn in on the path <br/>
between the rocks and hike north to the base of the ledge.Head left <br/>
and hike around to the backside of the ledge and enjoy the space,the <br/>
quiet,and the view.At the far eastern point take a reading of 260 deg <br/>
and follow the ridge to the far western point,once there take a <br/>
reading of 55deg and look for a beautiful medium size pine growing <br/>
out of the ledge.You will find the rattlesnake under a small ledge <br/>
under one of the branches of this pine...After stamping in head back <br/>
to the forest road and take a right (southwest)for a short walk to <br/>
your car............SO COME ON COUCH POTATOES COME AND ENJOY THE <br/>
WILDERNESS ....WE ALL NEED SOME PEACE IN OUR LIVES........HOPE TO SEE <br/>
YOUR STAMPS SOON............."TNT"(todd n taylor)  <br/>
