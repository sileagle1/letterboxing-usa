    I feel your pain.  Even before I could post the clues to the PNWLb site<br/>
or even to the LBNa site, two new boxes we had planted were viciously<br/>
destroyed and left as litter on the trail.  I know how you feel, and all I<br/>
can say is this.....<br/>
<br/>
    I've decided to take what little time they may have on this earth and<br/>
cherish it. If they get lost or stolen or destroyed, I'll simply recarve<br/>
them, knowing that I'm doing a better job this time.  That's one of the<br/>
reason I so enjoy the SitReps so that I know that at least someone also<br/>
found enjoyment in one of my boxes.<br/>
<br/>
    I know it doesn't help, but I just wanted to share my thoughts with you.<br/>
Please don't pull your boxes, they're one of the reason we stuck to this<br/>
hobby at the start.<br/>

&gt; Orca Mystery LB--vandized--missing stamp &amp; logbook!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok--I'm about to give up!  This is pushing a dozen the number of my<br/>
&gt; boxes that have gone missing in just a matter of weeks.  I won't say<br/>
&gt; where this one was but dang it--I'm getting to the point that I will<br/>
&gt; pull all of my boxes.  This is too frustrating. This one had an<br/>
&gt; incredible history in the logbook.  Is it a conspiracy?  Who knows???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If that's what these folks want then that's what they're soon going<br/>
&gt; to get.  Sorry that others don't get to enjoy this hobby anymore...<br/>
&gt; If folks can't be discreet in finding/stamping in/rehiding it, then<br/>
&gt; the hobby has NO FUTURE!!! I'm about to stop investing<br/>
&gt; time/resources in this...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry for bearing bad news, but I've just about hit my limit!!!<br/>

Sounds to me like someone has been targeting your boxes, such as they can.<br/>
As if Geocachers or someone else has stumbled across the clues and have<br/>
decided to remove the letterboxes for whatever their reason... Specially<br/>
coupled with these strange emails you've received.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we can only do one thing in a case like this... Outlast them.  When<br/>
they find them, I move them to a different spot.  To get the clues from the<br/>
PNWLb site, you have to be a registered member of the site. The system<br/>
tracks who's been viewing your boxes and will indicate the viewing history<br/>
to you.<br/>
<br/>
That's about the only things I can think of to still get to enjoy my hobby<br/>
and not call it quits.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I understand.  I'm just wondering why most boxes within a 5 mile<br/>
&gt; radius of one particular location are suddenly disappearing--as if<br/>
&gt; in an orchestrated manner???  That's what's driving me insane.  I've<br/>
&gt; had several boxes go missing over the past 14+ months--I understand<br/>
&gt; that and accept it as one of the hazards of the hobby.  It's the<br/>
&gt; letterboxes that have survived over a year and then methodically,<br/>
&gt; over the course of a few weeks, are suddenly disappearing or being<br/>
&gt; vandalized at a rate of about one a day--this, coupled with several<br/>
&gt; bizarre emails I've received lately, is driving me to the point of<br/>
&gt; frustration!  For example:  The ones that aren't hidden in locations<br/>
&gt; where someone would just 'accidentally' fall over them--these are<br/>
&gt; boxes that either somebody, with not so friendly intentions, has the<br/>
&gt; clues to or folks are not seeking discreetly and they're<br/>
&gt; compromosing the hiding spot while visiting the letterbox. I'm not<br/>
&gt; going to pull the boxes per se, I just plan on pulling the clues<br/>
&gt; from the national page--it'll lessen the traffic to the various<br/>
&gt; boxes (so if people really WANT them, they'll have to do some<br/>
&gt; research before they can find them).  I am, however, at the point<br/>
&gt; that when they go missing, they're history!<br/>
