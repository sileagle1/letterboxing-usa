                    <div class="plaintext-content">As those of you on letterbox-vision know, Dan has stated that he<br/>
will be removing links to my clues unless I place my clues physically<br/>
on his server (rather than using links to my server as I have been <br/>
for the past few months).  (I'm not sure how this makes the site better,<br/>
but its Dan's site and hence Dan's choice).  I have been asked by <br/>
someone to publicly address the situation, however.  Apparently <br/>
it is not an issue of content; Dan just wants the clues residing<br/>
physically on his server.  I'll admit, (as someone who first worked<br/>
with the Internet in 1985, is a career internet professional, and <br/>
has managed numerous internet servers), that I am at a total loss <br/>
as to why Dan cares what server any clues are on, or how this makes<br/>
it easier (a link to a local file is just as easy to code as is one<br/>
to a remote server).  <br/>
<br/>
I will, though, explain why I have chosen to publish my clues on <br/>
my server rather than Dan's, and will most likely not reply in <br/>
this thread, because, yeah, its boring, and I will have nothing <br/>
to add that has not been said a million times to those who are <br/>
interested.  Had I not been asked, I would not have posted this. <br/>
I don't care if you folks link to me or not, its your choice. <br/>
<br/>
Let me first say that I do not really feel a need to justify my decision<br/>
as to where I have published my clues.  Julie has chosen to publish<br/>
her's via e-mail, and we all respect that.  Mitch has stated that he <br/>
will be making hard links to his server, just like me, and we all <br/>
respect that.  I don't really care if people publish their clues on <br/>
the moon :-), it seems to me its their decision, and we've all <br/>
expressed that we are growing weary of the latest rules, but anyway,<br/>
here is why I have chosen to publish my clues on my server, and not <br/>
move them to Dan's server:<br/>
<br/>
* There is a puzzle (which I now have to reveal the existence of because<br/>
of this) that is hidden in the way my clues are hosted.  This is part<br/>
of the letterboxing game.  It would not be possible to implement this<br/>
puzzle on Dan's server (or if I did, everyone with access to the server<br/>
could solve it just by looking at the files in the public html directory).<br/>
Moreover, the puzzle will not mirror.  This one reason, which I told the<br/>
webmaster, alone, should have been enough.  When the decisions of the<br/>
webmaster compromise the game, that is too bad :-).  I have tried to<br/>
use technology to be creative in letterboxing, not let the technology <br/>
dictate the type of letterboxing activity that was possible. (Note: I <br/>
will be disabling the puzzle until people forget about this :-))).<br/>
<br/>
* It is easier for me to edit and update clues and create new ones.<br/>
<br/>
* It is easier for me to link them to other letterboxing sites,<br/>
if any wish to.  If there are 3 letterboxing sites, and they all<br/>
want copies rather than links of my clues, whenever I make a change,<br/>
I have to coordinate with three webmasters.  That seems like a hassle,<br/>
and I am a busy person. The web uses links for a reason.<br/>
<br/>
* I enjoy looking at the web server log to see what states and countries<br/>
people are visiting my clues from.  Its sort of like the log book in<br/>
the letterbox.  This functionality is unavailable to me on Dan's server.<br/>
<br/>
* I envision providing interactive clues powered by cgi scripts.  For<br/>
example, ask 10 trivia questions, and if you get them all, get a clue<br/>
at the end.  It is not possible to do this easily with client-side<br/>
scripting and be able to keep the user from cheating.  With cgi scripts,<br/>
it is fairly easy.  This functionality is unavailable to me on Dan's<br/>
server (and again, if my clues were on 3 other servers, coordinating<br/>
this with 3 system administrators would be a nightmare, to say the least).<br/>
<br/>
* If I go AWOL, my server and clues go AWOL.  This is a Good Thing.  As<br/>
for the mirroring argument, if the central server goes down, the links<br/>
from the mirror to my server will still work.  If my server goes down,<br/>
I'm prolly down too, see above.  All servers go down once in a while<br/>
temporarily, that is a different issue, and means nothing in the context<br/>
of these reasons.<br/>
<br/>
* In computer security terms, Dan has created an uncontrollable<br/>
circle of trust by giving out passwords to his site to several people,<br/>
and by sending his password over the Internet cleartext.  While Dan<br/>
may trust everyone he gives his password to, I don't even _know_<br/>
who has it.  They probably all are trustworthy people.  But I do<br/>
not know them.  I do not know if they understand computer security<br/>
and good password management.  From my point of view, strictly in<br/>
computer security terms, I do not have any control over the circle<br/>
of trust as to who can modify my clues.  In some of my clues, a<br/>
seemingly innocuous change will render them useless, forgetting anything<br/>
malicious.  I may not even notice the change.  Am I being paranoid?  <br/>
Probably, but I've been involved too long with Internet security to <br/>
not be.  The security situation is unacceptable _to me_, for the<br/>
publishing of _my_ clues.  Please don't anyone take this personally, <br/>
its just technical logic.  Since this is not a problem on my server,<br/>
my server is a better choice, even if it is not likely to be a problem<br/>
on Dan's.<br/>
<br/>
* I spent alot of time developing a little web ring/index of all my<br/>
clues.  I have a challenge out (in my FAQ) for anyone to try to find<br/>
them all, in which case they will get clues to a mystery box.  Not<br/>
only do I not want to throw work away, an index and web ring of my<br/>
clues on Dan's server would look a bit silly.  I have gotten some<br/>
positive feedback about this little setup.<br/>
<br/>
* Dan has mentioned to me as a reason for wanting all the clues on his <br/>
server, and I quote from a message dated 4/23/99:<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I also think that at some point people<br/>
&gt; may ask for a printed catalog, say for a given area.<br/>
&gt; If we have the clues housed together they can be<br/>
&gt; put into a printed format much more easily<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure Dan meant well, but I do not want it to be easy for anyone to<br/>
include my clues in print media without my involvement.  Assuming my<br/>
involvement, it makes no difference what server they are on, as print<br/>
and web media are different, would require a whole different approach,<br/>
etc.  This spooked me though, what difference does the server make?<br/>
<br/>
* Dan has mentioned as a reason for wanting all the clues on one server<br/>
as something like 'in case changes need to be made'.  I wish to be the<br/>
only person making changes to my clues.<br/>
<br/>
* I do not wish to have to deal with being asked to make changes to a<br/>
clue in order to get it published.  By putting it on my server, I do<br/>
not have to risk that hassle.<br/>
<br/>
* I am an Internet professional and sometimes consultant.  By keeping <br/>
the clues on my server, and running the server, it forces me to stay<br/>
in shape with these skills.  The practice, even for something this <br/>
small, helps in my professional career.<br/>
<br/>
* If for some reason I wish to quit letterboxing and pull my clues,<br/>
it is easy for me to do so.  I do not anticipate quitting, though.<br/>
<br/>
Folks, it is late and there are probably more reasons.  I just cannot<br/>
think of them.  All I can say is that I am ok if Dan (and you folks)<br/>
feel the site is better off without my clues.  I still do not understand<br/>
why Dan cares.  I hope the above makes it clear why I care, if you care, <br/>
that is ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I would like to editorialize about "open".  There has been alot<br/>
of rhetoric about the site being "open".  If the site cannot handle <br/>
something like linking to clues on another server, then it is not <br/>
open, IMHO.  I believe that others who write clues will share at <br/>
least one of my reasons for wanting to host them on the server of <br/>
their choice, and I feel the site should be able to handle that.  Its <br/>
better technology if it can.  It can now.  Even if you folks don't <br/>
want to link to me, for whatever reasons, I would recommend a policy<br/>
of being open to linking to other clue writers.  Think of it like <br/>
this: pretend the clue is simply a URL.  To be honest, the current <br/>
site uses links for all clues, just links to local files.  Nothing is<br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
Folks, I'm sorry but this seems sooooo silly :-)  Here are the reasons,<br/>
though, and I do apologize for the length, but not my decision.  If Dan<br/>
de-lists me, you are welcome access to all of my clues at<br/>

<br/>
May I join in Letterbox-vision ?<br/>
<br/>
I thought I was also in letterbox technology but no messages here either...<br/>
<br/>
I must say that I've been lurking for a long time because, well, as you<br/>
and I said a long time ago, Dartmoor Folk have different visions..but well<br/>
that may be true..but the core of the hobby is the blue and the green and<br/>
the search....and the connection with one another..via tiny boxes in a<br/>
huge planet....that's my view...<br/>
<br/>
The UK hobby grew out of the deepest love of a special place (Dartmoor) <br/>
and the US hobby is growing from the love and creativity of the arts and<br/>
craft movements .....which is also very cool...I love it too...<br/>
<br/>
But over all... this is the community of 'Boxing...great folk all<br/>
creative, all with sensitivity and imagination...a very explosive<br/>
chemistry at the best of time...Freedom is very hard to keep in strict<br/>
containers...so I guess I'm totally amazed to see Randy saying Danl wont<br/>
let him be free...<br/>
<br/>
I was not comfotable when there were wars about differing views with Doc<br/>
Mings..the wars hurt the hobby...I know which style I enjoy best but also<br/>
respect all the ways that freedom must be allowed to blossom...<br/>
<br/>
It seems such a small thing ..yet maybe that's the way big things<br/>
start...I hate these wars on the lists...why not link to Randy..what is<br/>
the real issue here ..am I, as Brit ,missing something here ?<br/>
<br/>
I like to feel myself an old Amerophile ...I've lived, been educated and<br/>
worked in the US most of my working life..and not all of that was as an<br/>
adult <grin> ...I've been working in the US over the last three weeks and<br/>
am off to Africa today then back to UK then another month in US<br/>
(Florida/DC/NY/SanFrancisco /Palo Alto..etc) so am also very busy but am<br/>
dedicated to this old crazy hobby.....Its about great people with great<br/>
spirits like you Danl and Mitch and The Vermont Viking  and MixtMedia and<br/>
StamperHog and Horsebeads and well, and well a whole heap of just creative<br/>
and explosive minds....fabulous....no offence intended by not listing<br/>
everyone !<br/>
<br/>
It's bound to be an explosive mix....It's bound to have folk who want to<br/>
run their own race...I know you are an organising mind..but do let your<br/>
children run free Danl.....They will love you better for that freedom....<br/>
<br/>
Hope my 2cents after such a long break doesn't annoy....I do enjoy reading<br/>
this site on the road....and love its ideas and all the work going<br/>
on....So do keep up the good work...and Lets all get Letterboxing...<br/>

<br/>
I am REALLY ANGRY at these little wars that are being staged.  A highlight of my day, is to check the list and see what's new with this virtual community.  I am now noe looking forward to checking in anymore...pitty.<br/>
<br/>
Graham said it best: "Let's all get Letterboxing...:<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we're misinterpreting the boxing part.<br/>
<br/>
Here's hoping we can get back to the fun<br/>
