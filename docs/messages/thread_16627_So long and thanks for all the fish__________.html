                    <div class="plaintext-content">First and foremost, please do not read any sarcasm in this letter, nor is this letter the rantings of a spoiled little child who has not gotten his way. These are simply words that come from deep inside and are said most sincerely.<br/>
<br/>
I wish to most humbly apologize to the person whose words I posted on my website from an email they sent to me.  It was wrong to do so. There are a hundred reasons as to why I did it, but none of them are actually right or valid.  Again, I am sorry for having posted those words on my website and they have been erased and purged from that site. <br/>
<br/>
Secondly, along the nature of those words, it has come to my attention that I have stepped on one to many toes (Two toes is two too many) in my manner of speaking, in my manner of posting, in the frequency of my posting and in stepping up and announcing another event in six months.  As of this moment, Boxapalooza is cancelled.<br/>
<br/>
I think we shall take a break from the mailing lists for awhile, perhaps one day, things will have settled down and we can start over.  In the mean time, we'll plant boxes, we'll search for other boxes and we'll maintain the website.<br/>
<br/>
So, to everyone, So long and thanks for all the fish, to quote a famous author.  We're going to cloak and lurk for awhile, but, for those that wish to talk to me, I can be reached at my personal email address.<br/>

maybe the dittos will annoy someone. It's a shame that what I thought <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Pardon a newcomer for posting here and all. Just been reading and <br/>
trying to see what is happening. Looks like same thing happened at <br/>
our church a couple times. Made me rethink about that.<br/>
<br/>
We had a new gal, Lizzie G. I'll call her, who moved into our area, <br/>
joined up with the Lady's Wednesday Evening Prayer and Improvement <br/>
Circle and noticed not much was going on. Oh, we had regular meeting <br/>
of the group but other than that, nothing. So, this new gal just <br/>
decided to have a Fall Festival like they did in her old church in <br/>
Des Moines. Kept the kids from celebrating that pagan holiday <br/>
Halloween. <br/>
<br/>
She asked around for help and most of the congregation had their <br/>
tails in a twist (pardon my French) and did nothing but talk about <br/>
how pushy and uppity Lizzie G. was, how she should wait her turn. Not <br/>
that anybody was doing anything else mind you but still.<br/>
<br/>
Quite a few kids showed up for that festival. We passed out cider and <br/>
bobbed for apples, pretty corny but for the kids it was new. Somebody <br/>
had a guitar and we sang some Girl Scout songs. Turns out the boys <br/>
knew some lyrics that were not appropriate. Anyway, it was a success, <br/>
we thought.<br/>
<br/>
Next day, Lizzie got called into the pastor's office. Seems she had <br/>
done all these wrong things. The pastor was sorry but the other <br/>
concerned mothers complained. Fire marshall wasn't consulted about <br/>
the jack-o-lanterns, those boys had been disruptive, and the church <br/>
could get in trouble. On and on. Lizzie and her family left our <br/>
church. I saw her and her daughter the other day at the market. She <br/>
is over with the Methodists now. They seem to enjoy her energy, she <br/>
said. <br/>
<br/>
Our church? We had some talk about doing something for this next <br/>
Halloween but nobody much stepped up to the plate. Guess we will stay <br/>
at home and pass out candy.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long post, but it just reminded me of stuff here. I <br/>
think we have to be careful about letting the forces of darkness and <br/>
chaos warp our sense of fun. If anybody wants to have a festival, go <br/>
up and ask to help if you want to. If you want to have something, ask <br/>
folks but don't expect a lot of help. Lord helps them that help <br/>
themselves, afterall.<br/>
<br/>
Gracious, I am beginning to sound like our pastor. Thanks for telling <br/>
me about letterboxing.<br/>

I've been around message boards and USENET newsgroups long enough to <br/>
recognize the inevitability of flames. Heck, I recently started <br/>
reading rec.running, and the flamewars that rage amongst that bunch <br/>
of testosterone-ladden ex-jocks makes us look like a bunch of tree-<br/>
hugging, granola-munching pansies. Which we are, thank goodness.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, nothing that goes on in the message board should "spoil <br/>
the hobby," since posting and reading the board is not, after all, <br/>
the hobby. The hobby is grabbing some clues, following them to a <br/>
box, etc. etc. You don't need to interact with the message board at <br/>
all to do that.<br/>

Just because you don't like someone doesn't mean they aren't right.  <br/>
I've stepped on toes before, and I'll likely do it again many times <br/>
in the future, but at least I try to stick to facts and don't sink so <br/>
low as to wish war, death, and destruction on those I don't like.  I <br/>
try to keep my criticisms professional and constructive, NOT <br/>
personal.  That post was making it personal.<br/>
<br/>
It is not okay to wish ill-well on someone, and I don't care who it <br/>
is.  I'm sure the post was made in the heat of the moment and the <br/>
person who made it doesn't REALLY mean what they said, and I'm not <br/>
inclined to hold such a post against her, but it was a very petty, <br/>
disgraceful, and hypocritical post.  That's not my opinion, it's a <br/>
fact.<br/>
<br/>
But notice, it's the post I'm attacking, not the person.  For all I <br/>
know, Purple Iris could be one of the nicest, most wonderful woman on <br/>
the planet who got carried away.  In fact, I hope that's the case.  <br/>
But the post was highly inappropriate for a civilized discussion.<br/>

Hmmmm, lets see, Quote: "and that you really smashed those<br/>
toes you stepped on."end Quote.  Yep, that falls under the heading of<br/>
wishing war, death and destruction.  Gets my vote for sure!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;I try to keep my criticisms professional and constructive, NOT <br/>
&gt;&gt; personal.  That post was making it personal.<br/>
<br/>
Personal??? Uh oh, seems to me I recall reading a nasty post in the<br/>
LbPNW by you where you make a direct attack, without provocation I<br/>
might add, upon Steve.  That comes under the heading of personal in my<br/>
book.  Doesn't matter that you tried to delete it, it was still made,<br/>
it still went out. Then in your "apology" you admitted to, and I<br/>
quote: "I talk plenty about people (both good and bad, I might add)<br/>
behind their backs" Then you go on to say: "But you should also<br/>
understand, I hold ill feelings towards you.  What annoys me is your<br/>
enthusiam ..."End quote. I call this personal, and this was the apology!<br/>
<br/>
So in my humble opinion this objection of yours is a bit of the pot<br/>
calling the kettle black.  <br/>

Is it getting a little hot?<br/>

Sure sounded that way to me.  <br/>
<br/>
Correct me if I'm wrong, but hoping for "really smashed toes" doesn't <br/>
sound very endearing or nice to me.  It sounds personal and <br/>
vengeful.  And such statements in a public forum should not be <br/>
tolerated.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody should be treated with respect.  You don't have to agree <br/>
with them and you don't have to like them--everyone is entitled to <br/>
their own opinions--but you must always treat them with respect.<br/>

A petty argument.  Wishing for crushed toes perhaps isn't as bad as <br/>
wishing for a WWIII, but saying so publicly is.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes, and it was completely and totally unappropriate for the board.  <br/>
I will not hold anybody to any standards that I wouldn't hold myself <br/>
to.  The post was inappropriate, but I do have opinions--good and bad-<br/>
-of other people.  A normal human trail.  Due to user error, my <br/>
private thoughts that had no business being on a public message board <br/>
did just that.<br/>
<br/>
As an owner and moderator of the board, I did to my post exactly what <br/>
I would have done to anyone else that posted a similar thought: I <br/>
deleted it and gave myself a talking to for doing something as <br/>
dumbass as posting it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So in my humble opinion this objection of yours is a bit of the pot<br/>
&gt; calling the kettle black.<br/>
<br/>
Well, if the kettle IS black, what difference does it make who says <br/>
so?  Would the spoon calling the kettle black have any more authority <br/>
than the pot?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I am the pot in this example, but if I see a black kettle, <br/>
I'm gonna call it black.  To argue it's not is an argument in <br/>
futility.<br/>
