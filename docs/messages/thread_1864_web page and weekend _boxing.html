Thank you for all that you do to keep the LBNA  up and running and for making it look so good!! Enjoyed reading about the 'boxing adventures  folks were having this past weekend and wanted to share mine. Along with Sue Clausen we followed the Delaware river south to Washington's Crossing State Park in Pa. Our goal was to locate Space Traveler's "Winahawcawchunk" box. Great area with lots of history !! We learned where Lake Monomonac is too..we were successful in our venture and added a unique stamp to our books.To our great enjoyment we discovered Bowman's Hill Wildflower Preserve right across the road!! We are already planning a return trip with the "boys" and i'm thinking of boxes to plant in that fertile land...see joy</h3></div><br clear="all"/><hr/>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a href="http://explorer.msn.com">http://explorer.msn.com</a><br/></body></html>
