                    <html><body>Hi Everybody!<br/>
<br/>
I just got back from McMinnville where I visited my letterbox the Spruce Goose.  Its alive and well.  Paisley Orca and Funhog were among the first few visitors and they always write such nice messages.  Greetings to everyone who signed in!<br/>
<br/>
I got a message from a fella down in Grants Pass area (hi dave!), who found our mystery letterbox Wild Eyed Things.  He said he heard about Letterboxing from reading an article in Country Weekly, which I have not seen, nor ever heard of for that matter.  It was just his second letterbox too!<br/>
<br/>
And, I received an article about Letterboxing and Geo-Caching in the mail from the Grants Pass Courier today that had been printed on 2-7-03.  It featured our Horse Trap Trail Letterbox and quotes from yours truly!  Two articles so close together!<br/>
<br/>
What a red letter day!<br/>
