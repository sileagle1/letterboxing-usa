                    <div class="plaintext-content">How about coming to the Campground Sunday morning and joining us for breakfast? I think if you get there around 9:00 AM you should still meet all of us campers. It's Colonial Woods Campground in Upper BLack Eddy. Go to www.colonialwoods.com . If not, there will be other gatherings and campouts. Or just post some Wed/Thurs that you're looking for a trail buddy for the weekend. Dude ands I will be glad to drive an hour or so to meet up and box with you. I am probably going to do very little, if any, boxing this weekend so there's still ton's of Bucks County boxes I need to get. Have a good weekend either way and hope to see you on the trail someday. Hey, that rhymes! <br/>

SO hey, hello nice to meet you to all the fellow letterboxers out there!  To answer your question about the "just flyin' through" box-- I checked it out about 6 months ago, after the construction etc.. and could not find anything.  I even had my newphew crawl behind the wall, we found some pretty interesting slugs, a few neat rocks but no box!  I am pretty sure it's MIA but would like someone else to make that decision.  Good luck-- Cherish aka "divinelotus" <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmmm-- about "Just Flyin' Through" -- I was talking about more recent construction, within the past month and a half.  Will construction never cease?!  When I checked again about 3 weeks ago, it appeared to be nearly completed, but I too couldn't find any sign of the box, even though it was pretty clear where it should be. The clues are very straightforward.  And it looked like lots of digging had happened right in that spot.  I think I already tried contacting the placers, but will try again if I don't hear anymore on this list.   --lunaryakketyact<br/>

missing.  We actually squeezed back where the box was to have been <br/>
and did not find nothing but the rocks and chuncks of cement <br/>
mentioned in the clues.  This was on June 19th.  What weas going on <br/>
was that the Parks Dept. built/renovated a bathroom building right by <br/>
there and also laid down a bunch of mulch in the area outside the <br/>
squeeze spot in between the fences.  I mentioned this to Raindear and <br/>
he said that he also could nto find the box when he looked.  I did <br/>
drop the hiders an email.<br/>

Hoping the box somehow returns,<br/>
