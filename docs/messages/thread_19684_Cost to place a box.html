<br/>
Anjabanja and I are about to place our first box!  We thought we'd <br/>
have it placed by this week, but we've decided to take just a little <br/>
bit longer to ensure that everything that should be in the box is, <br/>
and that's its fully prepared for life outdoors!<br/>
<br/>
Given that it's our first box, we've incurred some initial <br/>
expenses.  I thought I'd share them so people thinking of placing <br/>
boxes have an idea what it costs to place a box.  Man hours <br/>
necessary to gather the items, carve the stamp, scout a location, <br/>
and develop and publish clues are, of course, omitted.<br/>
<br/>
1 Rubbermaid 5153 3.4c Sure-Grip Rubber-sealed container = $1.97 at <br/>
Wal-Mart<br/>
1 Mead 63464 wire-bound 3x5 index card stock w/50 pages = $0.97 at <br/>
Wal-Mart<br/>
1 Speedball Speedy-Cut carving material (comes in various sizes) = <br/>
$1.50 approximate cost for stamp size (you won't use the full block <br/>
for one stamp)<br/>
1 Dye-ink pad = $1.00 at Michael's<br/>
2 Quart-sized zip-lock bags, Wal-Mart brand = 0.08 total (box of 25 <br/>
for $1.00 at WalMart)<br/>
1 wood block taken from a commerical stamp = $1.00 at Michaels <br/>
(taken from the bargin bin)<br/>
Adhesive for mounting stamp = nominal cost<br/>
<br/>
Total cost = $6.52<br/>
<br/>
Some of these items are substitutable and some (the wooden block, <br/>
for example) aren't necessary, so costs could be lower.  Give or <br/>
take, however, it will probably run anywhere from $5 to $10 for the <br/>
materials necessary to place a letterbox using reasonable quality <br/>
rubber, contaniners, bags, and logbooks.<br/>

GOOD POINTS! <br/>
<br/>
If you purchase your materials such as paper (for log books) and carving blocks in <br/>
bulk quantity, then you'll also save more. I've moved away from the need to mount <br/>
stamps by carving just the thick mastercarve blocks instead. Yes, the speedy stamp <br/>
(pink stuff) is firm and I like it much better, but when it comes down to whether or <br/>
not this stamp will survive a harsh maine winter with thawing and freezing, I'd <br/>
rather not take the chance at mounting it on a wood block.<br/>
<br/>
You can definitely save money on a box in many ways, but there is almost no way <br/>
of getting around the tough fact that wally-world seems to have the best supply of <br/>
the rubbermaid containers. Catbead also seems to have an ever-constant supply of <br/>
centrifuge tubes if you'd like (your letterbox size) to go down in scale. <br/>
<br/>
I find the smaller boxes 1) cost less 2) are easier to hide and finally 3)  are more <br/>
environmentally friendy. Something to consider. <br/>

much carving I discovered that a 1"wide  X 1 1/2" - 1 3/4" Long PZKut<br/>

Size wise, centrifuge tubes seem to fit that niche between rubbermaid<br/>
and film container.  Very, very easy to hide too.   <br/>
<br/>
I'm not plugging them to make a sale because the centrafuge tubes can<br/>
be purchased at some university bookstores.  If you live near a<br/>
college or university that has a biology dept., call the bookstore and<br/>
ask if they sell 50 ML centrafuge tubes.  They might cost a little<br/>
more but at least you can try some to see if you like them.  If you<br/>
want to read more about them, I have info on my website in the Goodies<br/>

what it costs to place one of these things.  We have planted 11, and<br/>

around with me - just in case I find the perfect spot).<br/>

Anyway, I thought I would break down our boxes and what we use... just<br/>
to compare notes and show others what is out there.  (I am NOT trying to<br/>
tell you either way is best, or anything like that, I promise!  So, no<br/>

I use the PZ Cut at http://www.stampeaz.com/  They are 10" x 4.75" and<br/>
1/4" thick.  Each sheet cost$5.00 and shipping is $4.00 for approx 5<br/>
sheets!  So, if you were to buy 5 sheets and pay for postage, you would<br/>
be paying $29.00.  If you carve  2x2" stamps, you can get 10 per<br/>
sheet... so.. 50 stamps for $29 makes it $0.58 per stamp.  (Did I do<br/>
that right?  Hubby is the math person, not me!).  I don't mount my<br/>
stamps... I guess I am too lazy =]<br/>
<br/>
I also found Rubbermaid Take Alongs.  They are better than the regular<br/>
disposable containers.  I buy the sandwich size, which are 2.9 cups.  At<br/>
Target I can get them 5 for $1.99 ($0.40 each).<br/>
<br/>
I tend to buy blank (no lines) index cards in packs of 100.  That is<br/>
enough for 2 books, and I pay $0.49 per pack at Target... so, that is<br/>
$0.25 each.  Of course, then I have to hole punch them and tie with<br/>
string/yarn - but we have a ton of that laying around the house.<br/>
<br/>
As for stamp pads, I don't put them in my boxes anymore.  I placed my<br/>
first box in March and when I went to look at the box this last weekend<br/>
the stamp was soggy and runny and didn't make a good imprint.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you want to be really cheap (cheap is always good around here as<br/>
hubby is also an accountant and wonders why we are always broke!  LOL),<br/>
you can go this route... and it brings the cost down to $1.23.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, when I was starting out, I didn't know all of this, so I am<br/>
sure I paid a lot more than this... but, as time has gone on and I have<br/>
been trying really hard to watch our budget, I have learned little<br/>
things along the way =]<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you want to camoflauge your boxes, that is a whole other cost =]<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Cost to place a box<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi all ...<br/>
<br/>
Anjabanja and I are about to place our first box!  We thought we'd <br/>
have it placed by this week, but we've decided to take just a little <br/>
bit longer to ensure that everything that should be in the box is, <br/>
and that's its fully prepared for life outdoors!<br/>
<br/>
Given that it's our first box, we've incurred some initial <br/>
expenses.  I thought I'd share them so people thinking of placing <br/>
boxes have an idea what it costs to place a box.  Man hours <br/>
necessary to gather the items, carve the stamp, scout a location, <br/>
and develop and publish clues are, of course, omitted.<br/>
<br/>
1 Rubbermaid 5153 3.4c Sure-Grip Rubber-sealed container = $1.97 at <br/>
Wal-Mart<br/>
1 Mead 63464 wire-bound 3x5 index card stock w/50 pages = $0.97 at <br/>
Wal-Mart<br/>
1 Speedball Speedy-Cut carving material (comes in various sizes) = <br/>
$1.50 approximate cost for stamp size (you won't use the full block <br/>
for one stamp)<br/>
1 Dye-ink pad = $1.00 at Michael's<br/>
2 Quart-sized zip-lock bags, Wal-Mart brand = 0.08 total (box of 25 <br/>
for $1.00 at WalMart)<br/>
1 wood block taken from a commerical stamp = $1.00 at Michaels <br/>
(taken from the bargin bin)<br/>
Adhesive for mounting stamp = nominal cost<br/>
<br/>
Total cost = $6.52<br/>
<br/>
Some of these items are substitutable and some (the wooden block, <br/>
for example) aren't necessary, so costs could be lower.  Give or <br/>
take, however, it will probably run anywhere from $5 to $10 for the <br/>
materials necessary to place a letterbox using reasonable quality <br/>
rubber, contaniners, bags, and logbooks.<br/>

Another good container is one The Family Dollar store sells made by<br/>
Alco  under the brand name 'Storage Tyme'.  They are look alikes to<br/>
the rubbermaid w/the blue seal and come in 3 nesting for $2.00.  The<br/>
largest is great for food, but the inner 2 are just right (said<br/>
Goldielocks) for hiding things in the woods.<br/>

&gt; I find the smaller boxes 1) cost less 2) are easier to hide and finally 3)  are more <br/>
&gt; environmentally friendy. Something to consider. <br/>

True, but then there's no room for hitchhikers! :)<br/>
