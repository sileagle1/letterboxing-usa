Tried to get to you thru lbna site, but it's messed up, so here's <br/>
your message for all to see . . .<br/>
<br/>
Here are the boxes we found last week:<br/>
<br/>
Chisolm Trail #4 (even though it's been there for nearly a year, we <br/>
were the first finders.  We had a very, very hard time finding it.  <br/>
The directions said to go 16 paces from the last picnic table.  Well, <br/>
we actually had to go at least 150 paces, and then one other small <br/>
thing-the box is NE of the grand daddy of all elms, not NW.  But it <br/>
sure was gratifying once we finally found it;)  )<br/>
<br/>
Mary's Box - Kim, it was so touching.  That's now one of my most <br/>
favorite stamps. Box is in great shape, but not hidden well at all, <br/>
seeing how all the leaves are gone off of the bush; I fear for it's <br/>
well-being.<br/>
<br/>
Also, happydays, we received your seminole stamp in the mail.  We'll <br/>
place it as soon as we can!<br/>
<br/>
