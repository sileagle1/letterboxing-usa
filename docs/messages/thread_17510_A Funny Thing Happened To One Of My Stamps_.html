What would HP do if you started using their HP logo for marketing your products?  I'm sure you would get a nice cease and desist letter from their lawyers followed by a lawsuit if you didn't.  Interesting how the big companies come down on the little guy with both feet but don't mind snagging his stuff to promote themsevles...<br/>

<br/>
Unfortunately, that is a common myth.  Posting something on the Web doesn't make it public domain material.  You still retain all rights to anything that you create, much the same as publishing your work in print.<br/>
<br/>
As long as the item is "an original work that has been fixed in a tangible form of expression", is has copyright protection. The fixation need not be directly perceptible so long as it may be communicated with the aid of a machine or device. (This information is from the U.S. Copyright office: http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html#wwp .)<br/>
<br/>
That being said, if you don't want someone to copy your stuff, don't put it on the Web.  There is no known way to absolutely prevent an unscrupulous person from taking your images or words off the Internet.<br/>

I dare say - what an unusual story! Very disturbing that the box has<br/>
gone missing as you said. Perhaps the person that "took" the box also<br/>
"took" your stamp and idea. If it was original (ie: from a sketch)<br/>
then I would reproduce that original sketch and/or design and send a<br/>
courtesy letter to the highest official head at HP and request via<br/>
that route.<br/>
<br/>
It would be a pity to think that someone went to great lengths to<br/>
reproduce your stamp in this matter for several reasons:<br/>
1) they did not contact you and ask<br/>
2) they did not give you credit for your work<br/>
3) your box and stamp are also missing (as evidence) <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps in future consider not making those images available through<br/>
any www avenue. It is unfortunate that you were not given due credit<br/>
for your art. Best of luck, Phyto<br/>
