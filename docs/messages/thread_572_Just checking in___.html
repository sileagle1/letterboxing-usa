<br/>
Der Mad Stamper here... just wanted to check in and let you all know that I'm <br/>
still alive.  I've been kinda busy lately, but hope to get caught up tonight. <br/>
 I placed another Portland letterbox yesterday (Sunday) at Blue Lake Park.  <br/>
Getting the clues published is somewhere on my to-do list.  Also, (for the <br/>
sake of those who are keeping track of such things) I'm still polishing up <br/>
the clue pages for Wendy's Enchanted Palos Verdes Letterbox and Diedra's two <br/>
new Green Bay boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Other minor items on my list (just so you all know you've not been <br/>
forgotten)... a slight change in the Cana Island clues,  updating the NJ map <br/>
to show the latest Long Island box, and checking out a bug in the Marsh Creek <br/>
links.  I'll try and get all these loose ends tied up tonight.  Let me know <br/>
if I've forgotten anything.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to mention that I had a wonderful lunch with Wendy on Saturday.  <br/>
She had ventured from California to visit the fair city of Portland, and had <br/>
managed to work some time in for letterboxing.  She had a lovely print of <br/>
Thom's Rock Creek #2 stamp to show for her efforts, too.  For some reason, <br/>
she insisted on packing up that California sunshine with her and bringing it <br/>
here.  Personally, I was quite happy with the cool, misty, Dartmoorish <br/>
weather we'd been having up until she came along!!  Oh, well.<br/>
<br/>
Wendy shared with me some of the wonderful prints she's collected from years <br/>
of stamper's retreats and card exchanges, and showed me her wonderful <br/>
portable stamp carving/printing studio (complete with light table).  It was <br/>
amazing... she had everything a stamp artist might desire neatly packed into <br/>
a box that was smaller than the shaving kit I carry when I travel.  It's <br/>
always nice to have another accomplished stamp carver in our group!!!  <br/>
<br/>
(Hey, Lone Wolf, from what I've seen of Wendy's work, I have a feeling that <br/>
the Enchanted Palos Verdes stamp is going to be worth the effort to hunt <br/>
for!!!  I can't wait to have an opportunity to go looking for it myself!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Tom, I got whale's tails in my mails... I'll scan them and email you as soon <br/>
as I get a chance.  Also, Steven, thanks for forwarding Dierdra's photo.  It <br/>
looks great.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, anyone who needs me to scan their photos, maps, stamp images, etc <br/>
for their clue pages, feel free to send them to:<br/>
