I sent an earlier poll asking about moving the Riverbend gathering into June <br/>
and now I am writing to say that it should definitely be postponed.  I called <br/>
to ask about the covered pavilion and was told that many of the trails are <br/>
washed out, flooded and unsafe and it is expected to be much worse by Saturday.  <br/>

&gt; It makes sense to move it to June - I've suffered enough mud.  But I'm <br/>
&gt; also really disappointed to move the date because I carved a pretty <br/>
&gt; elaborate event stamp that includes the date May 31. I don't want to <br/>
&gt; recarve it so my event stamp will be for the event we didn't have on <br/>
&gt; May 31.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See y'all at 10 am on June 14.  <br/>

Mary - keep the event stamp you carved, May 31 and all!  I for one would be <br/>
honored to have it stamped in my log, just an eccentric and one-of-a-kind <br/>
reminder of the event, and a fun story to tell later!<br/>
Can't wait to see you June 14!<br/>

Just a thought - the gathering seems to be moving more and more into <br/>
summer and there will always be people on vacation, etc.  Any <br/>
interest in still meeting on this weekend, but only for a potluck <br/>
type gathering around noonish with some stationery things like "how <br/>
to make logbooks", etc.  Obviously a much shorter time together but <br/>
worth a go?  <br/>

That's a great idea - like at an easier park or something?  Can you think of <br/>
a good place?  I'll forward your message and this response to the group and <br/>
that sounds great to me.  Gaabriel<br/>

It should be a park with lots of tables or better yet pavilions what about Bull Run?  We would have to book a pavilion for the day or half day, but with all the rain a lot of reunions and such have probably cancelled.<br/>
