&gt; Just a note to let you know that I had to move the Founding Fathers <br/>
&gt; Letterbox today.  The clues on the LBNA Website reflect the <br/>
change.  <br/>
&gt; Remember...these boxes are only out for the month of November!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>

Hello we are just jioning the Yahoo group but have been boxing for <br/>
just over 6 months. We have done a few of Jay &amp; Amy's and will try to <br/>
get to Otter Brook to see if it's around. not too far from us.<br/>
     Just wanted to say we looked and looked for this, Thanksgiving <br/>
Friday, and we sat on the hill and watched about 4 other groups look <br/>
&amp; look. Was kinda of funny,but we were disappionted especially having <br/>
traveled from up North in NH.Never found it but we had a great time.<br/>
