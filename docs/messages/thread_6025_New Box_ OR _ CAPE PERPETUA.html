box name: Cape Perpetua<br/>
County: ? (sorry)<br/>
Nearest Town: Yachats<br/>
Hike: easy-ish<br/>
directions: easy<br/>
<br/>
 From Highway 101 in either direction, park at the lot just across from <br/>
the driveway for the Visitor's Center.  (The small lot is slightly north <br/>
of the driveway, and has big informational signs on the north side.) <br/>
You'll need to pay the day use fee of $5 unless you have a NW Forest <br/>
Pass (recommended).  Though it looks small from here, the park is <br/>
actually huge, and you'll likely spend some time here once you have the <br/>
stamp in your logbook, so it's worth the fee. :)<br/>
<br/>
Go north, past the informational signs, along the highway.  (There's a <br/>
dirt path and a steel fence so you don't get slammed into by the traffic <br/>
or anything.)  Go past the wonderful lookout of the cape and cove, and <br/>
follow the signs at the next clearing area that lead to the trails.<br/>
<br/>
You'll be following the signs to Devil's Churn, an amazing little area <br/>
that isn't viewable from the road, where water rushes down a long <br/>
channel into a cave at the end and hisses/moans/roars, giving it its <br/>
name.   You can do this by either following the 2.8 mile trail (almost <br/>
all paved and certainly marked), or by diverting south at the place <br/>
where the trail branches to a sign about local wildlife.  Go down the <br/>
stairs and go around the cape on the rocks below to see some wonderful <br/>
tidepools.  (Good with kids, but only advisable at low tide, of course.)<br/>
<br/>
When you get to Devil's Churn, you'll find some cement stairs leading <br/>
back up to the main trail.  Go up the first set of nine, then the next <br/>
set of three, and the set of two afterward.  At the second bench on a <br/>
switchback, sit down.<br/>
<br/>
To your left is a stone retaining wall built by the CCC.  Count eight <br/>
stones from your waist going left up the top edge of the wall, and <br/>
you'll find a stone that juts out with a hole behind it.<br/>
<br/>
The letterbox is in the hole.  Please be careful when putting it back so <br/>
that it doesn't fall all the way to the bottom.  (It shouldn't -- the <br/>
box is bigger than the hole, but it may be bigger by the time you get <br/>
there, of course.)  You'll recognize the stamp from the signs in the lot <br/>
where you parked.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the trail back, and do hit the Visitor's Center before you go. <br/>
The day we were there, there was a resident pod of California Grey <br/>
Whales making an appearance in the waters, visible from the center, <br/>
which made all of the hike worth it. :)<br/>
