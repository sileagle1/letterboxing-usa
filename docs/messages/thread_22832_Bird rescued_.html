                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to P?uest for letting me know that my letterbox, In the Tree:  <br/>
Meghan's Bird, was in grave danger so that I could rescue her in the nick of  time!  <br/>
For who knows what reason, park personnel are putting up a fence  that will <br/>
cut off access to the tree in which the bird lived, and I was just  able to get <br/>
there in time to pull the box -- temporarily, I hope.   She'll be relocated <br/>
very soon, I hope in the same park, but for now, that box  has been pulled.    <br/>
Be sure to check the clues before you go  looking for her.  Thanks again for a <br/>
very timely find and contact,  P?uest!  -- Viewfinder!<br/>
