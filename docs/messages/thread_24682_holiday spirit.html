<br/>
   We took our girl scout troop today to help stuff bags for toys for <br/>
tots &amp; salvation army &amp; they didn't have any work for us to do <br/>
because of a lack of donations! The girls (ages 8-10) were very upset <br/>
about some of the families not receiving toys for christmas, etc. <br/>
Apparently, not as many people are donating this year for many <br/>
reasons, financial strain/lost jobs, no advertising (walmart had <br/>
their barrels inside the service center this year, and not out by the <br/>
entrances to remind people) <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, the girls have been thinking of ways to round up more <br/>
donations. They wanted to "picket" in front of walmart, doing cheers <br/>
about toys, then we called local news stations &amp; the newspaper, not <br/>
much response on a Saturday. <br/>
<br/>
Well the girls ended up voting and decided to give up some of their <br/>
dues funded troop money, including for a field trip to a mystery <br/>
dinner theater &amp; their xmas party - and voted (unanamousley) to spend <br/>
$110 to buy toys to donate. They headed to walmart, and went through <br/>
to pick out the best deals to get more toys for their money. They did <br/>
pretty well &amp; we dropped them off at the distribution center. <br/>
<br/>
What I would love is for you all to spread the word and encourage <br/>
people to donate new and unwrapped toys to toys for tots, or any <br/>
other charity that helps kids at christmas. Our girls learned a big <br/>
lesson in christmas spirit and giving, not receiving this year, one <br/>
that I hopes stays with them their entire lives, which is what girl <br/>
scouting is all about (yeah, yeah, yeah, i'm babbling) <br/>
<br/>
Ask for bins at locations like walmart, etc. Their final date for <br/>
pick up is Dec 20th, so it's not too late! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any word of mouth you can give us, or even if you can go <br/>
out and make your own donation! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have already donated a couple toys this year but since there is such a need, I think it's within my budget to come up with something else.  Most of the requests I have seen this year have been for smaller items..hats, pajamas, art supplies, matchbox cars.  I don't remember my kids ever having to ask "Santa" for such things.  Yep, we're off to the store to cheer up a little face for the holidays.  Thanks for bringing this to our attention.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm involved with Cub Scouts and I think perhaps one of the most<br/>
exhilirating things I encounter with them is when they catch the fever and<br/>
set their minds to "doing something" about a problem.  I try always to tell<br/>
them they are never too young or too small to make a difference, and your<br/>
girls are doing just that!  Awesome story...<br/>
<br/>
But I have a flip side story, that in its own way is just as touching -<br/>
although I'm not sure quite what to make of it yet.  One of the Assistant<br/>
Scoutmasters for the troop connected to our pack was contacted by one of the<br/>
local volunteer fire departments that collected toys for underprivileged<br/>
children.  It seems they had such an overwhelming response to their drive,<br/>
AND they have had a lower than expected registration to receive gifts, so<br/>
that they have TOO MANY donated items for the kids on their list!  They are<br/>
looking for organizations to help them track down needy kids and distribute<br/>
gifts and we're going to help with that.  I'm thrilled that our local<br/>
communities have been so generous, but what's up with not enough people to<br/>
receive the donations?  I've NEVER heard of that before!<br/>
