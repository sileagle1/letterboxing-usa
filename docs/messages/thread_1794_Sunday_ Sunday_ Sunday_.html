<br/>
You can still count my daughter and I in for the get together Sunday. <br/>
The bring your own meal and a dessert to share idea works well for us<br/>
especially with a picky eater.  I have the directions and have already<br/>
printed out the local clues but what exactly is the time table for this<br/>
event?  Are we checking in when we can and meeting at a certain time for<br/>
dinner and activities?  Should we bring a carved stamp for the contest<br/>
or will we carve there?  Please forgive the questions but I'm one of<br/>
those "have to know the details" people.  Thanks for all your effort to<br/>
bring us all together.<br/>
<br/>
