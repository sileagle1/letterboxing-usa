then added the entrance sticker from the Vermont Morgan horse farm (a box I<br/>
didn't find).  Sunday we found the Hip Hop box in Bennington, Vt, but before<br/>
we looked, we went to the Bennington Museum, so I added the entrance sticker<br/>
to that, plus a small paragraph of the day.  I also have a few pages set<br/>
aside for the stamps of boxes I've placed, virtual boxes I've found, and<br/>
stamps that a friend has sent from Dartmoor.   Kittlekatz<br/>

                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>In our logbook, we have each letterbox we find on it's own page, with the name of the box, the name of the park/area it was in, the city and state, and the date. We also make a notation of which member of our family actaully found the box, as there are four of us, and we all use the same stamp (our two boys don't carry their own stamps yet). Finally, if we find a hitchhiker, we note it in our book, as well as the box logbook, and we make a similar note when we drop one off.
