Haven't tried this one yet, but actually decided to<br/>
try this series next weekend.  I will let you know<br/>
then.  Actually had our own problems with the Alice in<br/>
wonderland series in Exeter, RI.  Couldn't find the<br/>
seventh box and it is driving us nuts!  If anyone has<br/>
any suggestions or has had the same problem, please<br/>
drop a line.  Hope everyone is enjoying this weather. <br/>
HEading to the beach today!<br/>

Gosh, that describes so few places in Carolina Management Area!  :)  We hung in there, casting about.  We also found that we took the wrong trail up the hill from the canoe camp crossing.  Never give up!  (Especially with the Tin Woodsman).  It's a great series, and it only gets better.<br/>
