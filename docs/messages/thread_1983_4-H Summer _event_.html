boxes including the TAC box many got at the winter gathering and some <br/>
others available only during the three days of the fair. There will <br/>
be no special meeting as I will be very busy getting kids and cows in <br/>
to the show ring. As a family event  this should be #1 the boxes will <br/>
be on the fairgrounds and make sure that you see all the exhibits in <br/>
your quest.  Sorry but there is a parking fee for the fair as a way <br/>
to cover the many expenses. The dates:    Aug. 10,11,12  there will <br/>
be an event stamp.  More details to follow.    Carol<br/>
