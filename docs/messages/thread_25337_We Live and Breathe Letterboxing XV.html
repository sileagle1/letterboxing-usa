jam-packed full of letterboxing madness and mayhem to help celebrate the fifteen<br/>
year anniversary of our beloved hobby!<br/>
<br/>
We will be frolicking in the forest along the beach of Grotonwood Christian Camp<br/>
in Groton, MA. This is your chance to experience summer camp for letterboxers!<br/>
<br/>
All ages are welcome, and we're planning to organize everything... food, cabins,<br/>
entertainment, and an amazing variety of letterboxes! All you need to bring is<br/>
your sleeping bag, your letterboxing gear and your sense of adventure as we<br/>
revel in the past, look forward to the future, and party 'til the needles fall<br/>
off our compasses!<br/>
<br/>
Mark your calendars now for Labor Day weekend, August 30 through September 2,<br/>
2013. Stay tuned to our event listing on AtlasQuest<br/>
(http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=1970) for costs, reservation<br/>
information and additional details as they develop.<br/>
<br/>
We promise this is a celebration you won't want to miss!<br/>
<br/>
