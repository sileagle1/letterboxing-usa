Boise, Idaho<br/>
Ada County<br/>
Placed by A-Bear on 15 December 2002<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Take Exit 50 south from I84 onto Cole Road.  Follow signs <br/>
to the World Center for Birds of Prey.  Drive about 5 miles until <br/>
Cole Road ends (you'll drive only a short ways passed the entrance to <br/>
the World Center for the Birds of Prey.)  Park at the end of Cole <br/>
Road. <br/>
<br/>
Level of Difficulty:  Easy &amp; extremely short, but not easily <br/>
accessible to handicapped as one must cross a ditch and rocks to <br/>
locate the letterbox.  You want to spend the rest of the time at the <br/>
actual World Center for the Birds of Prey.  <br/>
<br/>
Bird's Eyes Clues:<br/>
Start from the street entrance to the World Center for the Birds of <br/>
Prey where you see the two large boulders (one with World Center for <br/>
the Birds of Prey and the other with The Peregrine Fund).  Follow the <br/>
street (Cole Road) south with your eyes on the wooden fence and brick <br/>
wall that parallel each other on your right.  When they both stop, <br/>
spot the shrub on the east side of the brick wall.  Behind and under <br/>
that shrub and under a pile of rocks you will find the Bird's Eyes <br/>
Letterbox.  Please hide the owl well and then drive the rest of the <br/>
1.5 miles to the World Center for the Birds of Prey if you like<br/>
(entrance to that is $4, but finding the letterbox before that is <br/>
free).  <br/>
