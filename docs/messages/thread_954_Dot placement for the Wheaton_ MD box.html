COOL!  I was going to visit the fort last weekend when I was down there, but didn't, so I guess now I'm glad I didn't.  I'll wait for your series Marisa!!!!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I didn't get any letterboxing done all weekend :((  It was a "little" humid though.  Maybe this fall calls for another DC trip...<br/>

<br/>
I did put Kid Gloves outside of Washington, knowing I was only <br/>
winging it this first posting. Jay's clues seemed to indicate it was <br/>
in Bethesda/Chevy Chase.<br/>
<br/>
Jay, if you or Marisa can indicate where to put the dot on the <br/>
regional map, I'll try tog et it right. Ditto for your other boxes, <br/>
Jay.<br/>
<br/>
I think Randy's suggestion to use Metro DC rather than Washington DC <br/>
as a label is a good one - in line with what's been done in other <br/>
large border towns, e.g. East St. Louis, the regional map of which <br/>
also contains a box in the nearby state.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>
