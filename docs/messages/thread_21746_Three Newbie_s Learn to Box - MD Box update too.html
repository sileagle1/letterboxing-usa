I went out boxing yesterday with two newbies, All Daydream (A.D.)and <br/>
Yuri Nahl, and All Daydream's Darling (A.D.D.)<br/>
<br/>
We had a 100% seek and find ratio and were very happy.  Plus, among <br/>
the four of us we had different goals in mind.<br/>
<br/>
All Daydream WAS all about the journey, hopping along from rock to <br/>
rock and swearing at me under her breath, because I told her she'd be <br/>
fine in flipflops.  - My bad.<br/>
<br/>
Yuri had the fabulous knack of spotting that curious pile of rocks. <br/>
He homed right in on the hidey holes.  "Hey, that looks odd." -<br/>
casually flipping over a rock and finding the box. I think he's all <br/>
about the camaraderie without having to go to meetings.<br/>
<br/>
All Daydream's Darling (A.D.D.) was SO excited. While Yuri and A.D. <br/>
were off the path around a tree, bending to retrieve, A.D.D. <br/>
yells "DID YOU FIND IT?!" then hung his head in embarrassment <br/>
remembering this was kind of a secret thing.<br/>
<br/>
So I yelled, "Did you find your keys?!" To help cover up. <br/>
A.D.D. really enjoyed looking through the logbooks to see who was <br/>
there and who wrote what.<br/>
<br/>
We retrieved one of my boxes. It had been reported that the stamp was <br/>
gone but the book was still there.  It was a high traffic area, so I <br/>
tested the three newbies on clandestine retrieval.<br/>
<br/>
Yuri needs to work on his "I'm-not-up-to-anything" look.  But A.D.D. <br/>
is a natural in diversionary tactics. Talking to strangers and <br/>
blocking their view of the grab.<br/>
<br/>
All in good condition are....<br/>
Bassackwards I and II<br/>
Fun at the Falls I and II (II was slightly damp)<br/>
Forestheart Labyrinth<br/>
<br/>
Along the way we also planted a hastily carved box at a covered <br/>
bridge.  - Clues to come soon to lb.org.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading the ramble.<br/>

Poison Ivy,<br/>
What time were you at Cunningham Falls?  We were there checking on our <br/>
boxes around 4:00 or so!  I don't remember seeing you in the books, so <br/>
maybe you were after we left.<br/>
