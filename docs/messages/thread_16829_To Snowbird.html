I haven't ignored your messages. When I try to reply to you, it says <br/>
it's undeliverable because your account is over your quota. <br/>
<br/>
Try deleting several messages or saving them to disk &amp; then deleting <br/>
them from your mail program. Be sure to 'empty' the delete folder <br/>
too. Even if you have messages stored in seprate folders, it counts <br/>
toward your quota. <br/>
<br/>
You are definitely invited to the party (even if you haven't gotten <br/>
to F-100 yet!) Just let me know you'll be coming so I can reserve a <br/>
chair for you. All the info was posted to this talk list earlier this <br/>
week (messages 35530 &amp; 35575). I hope to see you there!<br/>
 The over quota problem is affecting your other request too.<br/>
