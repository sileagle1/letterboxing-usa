                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was so excited to find #300 this past week.  It was even more fun <br/>
because I had CW Sun Seeker there cheering me on.  Thanks to all of <br/>
YOU out there who keep placing more boxes for me to find.  I <br/>
definitely couldn't have reached this without YOU.<br/>
<br/>
#300 was the "Forever United" created by Needeeps of CT and planted <br/>
by CW Sun Seeker in Midvale, UT.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to J-Bear especially for putting up with this crazy <br/>
letterboxer of his.  =-)  <br/>
<br/>
Wishing we could be in Kernville this weekend, but can't work it <br/>
out.  Have fun though.  =-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
A-Bear (who will travel if you plant them)  =-)<br/>

Congratulations! You will be missed in Da'Ville this weekend, I even <br/>
had an extra raft for you to use. Tell J-Bear the fishing is poor <br/>
though due to runoff from the burnt area.<br/>

We're prepared to get to F200 this weekend at the Kernville gathering. <br/>
