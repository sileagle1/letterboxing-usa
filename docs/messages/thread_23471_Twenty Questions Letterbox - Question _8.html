                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is a tough one.  Worcester, Middlesex, and Essex are also still in <br/>
the loop.  But....We are down to only 6 counties.  Here are some <br/>
thoughts.....<br/>
<br/>
Is it in a county that borders Plymouth County?<br/>
Does the county border either New Hampshire or Maine?<br/>
Does the county border Buzzard's Bay?<br/>
Is it on the Cape? (Maybe a bit premature?)<br/>
<br/>
I do like the idea of asking about whether it's in a state park, <br/>
however, if the answer is no, that'll leave about every public area <br/>
within each city or town.  On the flip side, there aren't many state <br/>
parks in the areas that are left, that, if the answer is yes, we'll <br/>
dramatically reduce the areas.  Again, a tough one.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we could reduce it by asking if the box is within a certain <br/>
distance from the Atlantic Ocean, say 30 miles.  That would not only <br/>
reduce the counties, but also reduce the area within certain counties.<br/>
<br/>
Any more discussion?<br/>

people thinking in the wrong direction..i.e. if the box were 35mi from the<br/>
Atlantic, and we asked about 30mi, people might start thinking too far<br/>
inland.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think I'll ask about the 3 Cape area counties.  :-)<br/>

While we were away on vacation when this clue premiered, it's been fun sitting back and watching the theories and questions evolve!<br/>
Who knows - that might have been part of the idea by the mystery's author. Keep up the good work! <br/>

If it's in Barnstable, I'll chime in on this quite a bit more.  As<br/>
long as it's after Relay for Life this weekend.<br/>
