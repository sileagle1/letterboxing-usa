<br/>
I snuk out this afternoon and went up to Fort Steilacoom Park, to place a<br/>
few letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Found out the hard way that we all should plan on being done searching for<br/>
LBs by 5:30, thanks to DST (Darkness Startsearly Time).  After placing my<br/>
last LB by Braille, it was definitely too dark to do anything but follow the<br/>
wide paths on the way back to the parking lot, and I got back there by 5:45.<br/>
Or we could have a bon fire by the WA Territorial Insane Asylum (the Haunted<br/>
Building) and tell ghost stories!<br/>
<br/>
I drove around and spotted additional picnic tables located at various<br/>
places around the Park, but they appeared to be similar to the one by the<br/>
Boat Races - uncovered and unelectrified.  On the off chance that it is<br/>
raining too hard, we could always go to Ryan's new Gourmet Restaurant,<br/>
located just down the road, he might provide the hot coffee!<br/>
<br/>
I prepared yet another Hitch Hiker (in it's own Rubbermaid Box!) for this<br/>
great event, but when I got to where I was going to place it, it was<br/>
missing!  Don't know where it fell out, several possibilities.  Will try to<br/>
locate it Saturday morning.  If not, keep you eye open for it, the first to<br/>
find it gets a prize!  The prize being the opportunity to claim Firsties on<br/>
the HH.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to a great (and dry) day of Letterboxing this Saturday!<br/>
<br/>
See you all there, Fudrick<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi all!  Only 4 short days until our big day!!! I'm still out of<br/>
&gt; town (Salem, OR) on a pesky, last minute business tasking--heading<br/>
&gt; back North at the moment--hoping to return home tomorrow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for the 'scheduled' meeting area, there is one picnic table where<br/>
&gt; we were planning on meeting.  However, in other sections of the<br/>
&gt; park, there may be more resources, possibly even electrical<br/>
&gt; outlets.  What I'm not sure about though is the Saturday morning<br/>
&gt; soccer crowd and their impact on the park during the early-mid<br/>
&gt; morning hours.  Another option we could do, though, is a good old-<br/>
&gt; fashioned vehicle tailgate???  Reminiscent of football games or eras<br/>
&gt; goneby?  Let's plan on meeting at the original venue which is the<br/>
&gt; table by the lake (near the Model Boating sign) and we'll go from<br/>
&gt; there.  If a new venue is necessary, we'll post a sign indicating<br/>
&gt; where to meet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'll have name tags available and a few other interesting &amp;<br/>
&gt; mysterious companions.  Perhaps a jail-break is imminent?  ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I FINALLY (I can't wait) get home, I'll scout out the park and<br/>
&gt; see if there is a more appropriate local for our potluck event.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps by the playground might be a better location.  Let me<br/>
&gt; investigate and I'll post what I learn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; See you on Saturday &amp; keep placing boxes!!!  Hitchhikers, travelers<br/>
&gt; and LB newbies are more than welcome, too!!!<br/>
