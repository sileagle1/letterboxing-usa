Subject: [LbNA] Stamp size<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Most of my stamps are 1.75" x 2.5" and several are almost 3"x3" .   If<br/>
&gt; you are concerned about small log books, perhaps you could bring along<br/>
&gt; some pre-stamped images to leave in the box if the book provided seems<br/>
&gt; too small?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
It's not so much a question of log book size since I don't care if I can<br/>
only leave a partial imprint in micro-books (I also carry my old stamp<br/>
around too, in case I break the new one).  This letterboxing thing is a<br/>
truely new experience for me... not only is the hobby (sport?) new, but for<br/>
the first time in my internet experience, I actually hope to meet some of<br/>
the faceless folks behind the computer screens.  I'd hate to walk into a<br/>
gathering only to find that I was being a jerk by over doing it with my<br/>
stamp!  I take it from your response, tho, that big is okay.  Thanks!<br/>
