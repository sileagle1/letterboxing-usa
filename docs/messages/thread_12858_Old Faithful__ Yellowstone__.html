We're going on a trip to Yellowstone.  I KNOW I found clues to a box by Old<br/>
Faithful awhile ago and now I can't find it anywhere.  Maybe I'm looking in<br/>
the wrong place.  Anyway, if someone could point out to me any boxes within<br/>
the park, I'd really appreciate it.<br/>

&gt; Does anyone know who owns [the Elaine and Jerry's Bluff] box?<br/>
<br/>
This box was placed by the EMS Waterford staff, June '98.  I believe<br/>
it was the first one they placed, and thus the first in CT (post<br/>
Smithsonian era), but I would have to check my records to confirm that.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I found that box, there were 37 entries in the logbook,<br/>
which was a staggering amount in those days.  It was prolly more than<br/>
entries then in all other logbooks around the country combined.<br/>
<br/>
Hand carved stamps were extremely rare in those days, especially in<br/>
CT.  I'd have to check if was hand carved -- if someone wants a scan,<br/>
e-mail me, as it might be worth carving a replacement as it is a<br/>
historic box.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

I was more referring to broken down boxes more than obscured clues.Obscured<br/>
clues well you can always go back and try again if you did not find it the<br/>
first time.What got me mad is when I found a box with no stamp in it,and I<br/>
know a fellow letterboxer reported 6 months ago and it was not<br/>
replaced.Maybe the owner of the box did not see the posting about their<br/>
box,that is why I said if we had a list we could check it.I myself have 50<br/>
boxes out there and i,m starting to learn its not easy to check them all the<br/>
time.I have found boxes full of water,cracked boxes,full logbooks and other<br/>
things.I just thought it would be easier if we had a place to jog them<br/>
down.I know we look out for each others boxes now the best we can,but I<br/>
thought a list would be better.As far as obscured clues,that just added fuel<br/>
to the fire because we were tired,we have been boxing all day fri-sat and it<br/>
was near the end of the day.I,m sure that the box is there,we just need to<br/>
relax regroup and rethink we will get it next time.And for the obscured<br/>
part, I Apologize Especially to Music Woman aka.Pam.<br/>

Ahhhh .... now that makes sense.  A place to notify a box owner that<br/>
their box needs maintenance.  *nods*  :) However, I think that if Wes<br/>
can work it out so that the box owner can be contacted by secure<br/>
email via the clue page, it might eliminate the need for such a place.<br/>
<br/>
As you said - we look out for each others boxes now the best we can -<br/>
but some notification system would be a really helpful solution.  We<br/>
need to remember that not all letterboxers read and subscribe to this<br/>
list.  None of my local friends who letterbox use this list (for<br/>
example).  Also, if someone posted a problem to another "place" that<br/>
might not get checked regularly, either.<br/>
<br/>
I think the solution might be an easier way to contact the box owner,<br/>
rather than to just post publicly about problem boxes.  *shrug*<br/>

What a pleasant walk we had enjoying the wildflowers along the trail.<br/>
The bank of nastursiums (sp?) evoked childhood memories of home.<br/>
...took a photo op at the rope swing and survived!  ...spoke with two<br/>
young boys performing "jumps" on their bikes at the lower portion of<br/>
the trail.  ...found the box intact and in good condition.  Finding a<br/>
plastic bag, we decided to pick up trash on the way back to the car.<br/>
...an added bonus--I found a blue-striped marble and Hubby found a<br/>
dollar bill!!  Thank you...we enjoyed finding this box!   ...H&amp;S--<br/>

&gt; I disagree that the mystique is the essential thing.  The essential<br/>
&gt; thing for me is getting out and seeing new places and enjoying new<br/>
&gt; hikes and not taking forever deciphering vague clues to find the<br/>
&gt; box.  This is especially important for me since my family is not<br/>
&gt; "into" letterboxing like I am, so if I manage to drag them with me I<br/>
&gt; don't want to waste too much time deciphering clues while they<br/>
&gt; get impatient and like the hobby even less.  Also, if I visit<br/>
another<br/>
&gt; state and want to letterbox, I don't usually have much time so I<br/>
&gt; don't want to waste it looking for boxes with vague directions and<br/>
&gt; clues.  In fact, I will avoid even looking if they look vague<br/>
online.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That said, I do agree that some boxes should be harder to find for<br/>
&gt; those times when you want the challenge.  I just would be less<br/>
likely<br/>
&gt; to try for those than others.  I guess I just prefer the physical<br/>
&gt; challenge of finding boxes rather than the mental one.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; the mapping becomes more imperfect.  This represents two sides<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I call the golden triangle of treasure hunting.  The thrill of<br/>
&gt; &gt; discovery<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; occurs when these imperfections are experienced.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  [...]<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe I'm part of the minority, too, but I wholeheartedly agree<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; the mystique is the essential thing. Lets hear it for the golden<br/>
&gt; &gt; triangle of treasure hunting! For me, the stamp and logbook in my<br/>
&gt; hand<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a surprise and reward for the journey. It isn't as much fun<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; &gt; I've seen them online even before I've even left the house.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Likewise I prefer the minimalist clues that make you do a little<br/>
&gt; &gt; homework to find the box instead of spelling out every freeway<br/>
exit<br/>
&gt; &gt; and cross street just to get to the parking lot where the trail<br/>
&gt; &gt; starts. Its all part of the thrill of the hunt, to pull out the<br/>
&gt; &gt; roadmap and find the way to that park or that trailhead, not<br/>
really<br/>
&gt; &gt; knowing what to expect there. I think its possible to make an<br/>
&gt; elegant<br/>
&gt; &gt; and straightforward clue without cluttering it up with unnecessary<br/>
&gt; &gt; information. Whether its an easy or hard clue, it can still be<br/>
&gt; written<br/>
&gt; &gt; simply and clearly.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, thats just what I find enjoyable about these kinds of<br/>
&gt; treasure<br/>
&gt; &gt; hunts. What does everyone else think?<br/>

&gt; Well, I'm annoyed. I just stopped by the Chicago Underground<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Its located near my work, so I often stop by to check out the<br/>
stamps<br/>

missing.<br/>
&gt; I thought for a moment that letterboxers may have "borrowed" it<br/>
in<br/>

was<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'm not sure when I'll finish making a replacement, and not<br/>
sure where<br/>

now<br/>

<br/>
This past mothers day week-end we had two days of family letterboxing...two<br/>
from Anchorage, four from Montana and our daughter, her 5 yr old and her<br/>
nine mo old from the Issaquah area.  Friday we found Amanda`s Flaming Guyser<br/>
box.  We went one a long wild goose chase for a non Amanda box.  Saturday we<br/>
went on a great hike and found Amandas two Holloween letterboxes.  We let<br/>
the five yr old look behind the trees and under the rocks for the boxes.<br/>
Now he and his mom are hooked.  They are lucky as the are zillions of boxes<br/>
to be found in the Seattle area.  Here in Montana boxes almost do not exist,<br/>
although we are trying to change that.  Finding is more fun than planting!<br/>
So, our hats off to Amanda who made the hunt sucessfull.  Rockmover and<br/>
Quiltmaker.  F5  P7<br/>

I prefer the easy clues also especially since we're new at it! But I mostly<br/>
enjoy letterboxing because it's a great activity to do with my boys and we<br/>
all have fun hunting down boxes together and we love to be outdoors!  I<br/>
don't want to have to struggle with clues...I want it to just be fun!<br/>

But I do bow to those who can puzzle out the really difficult clues and<br/>
solve them!  :)<br/>

to find that box, you may want to wait until at least June when we can get<br/>
back and put a new stamp in.<br/>

I prefer the easy clues also especially since we're new at it! But I mostly<br/>
enjoy letterboxing because it's a great activity to do with my boys and we<br/>
all have fun hunting down boxes together and we love to be outdoors!  I<br/>
don't want to have to struggle with clues...I want it to just be fun!<br/>
<br/>
But I do bow to those who can puzzle out the really difficult clues and<br/>
solve them!  :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; This box was placed by the EMS Waterford staff, June '98.  I believe<br/>
&gt; it was the first one they placed, and thus the first in CT (post<br/>
&gt; Smithsonian era), but I would have to check my records to confirm that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
        I think it was the 2nd box.  #1 was Misery Loves Company.  It was<br/>
the also the<br/>
        2nd box Dan and I found way back in April of 1999.  Before we even<br/>
had Max!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hand carved stamps were extremely rare in those days, especially in<br/>
&gt; CT.  I'd have to check if was hand carved --<br/>
<br/>
        Yes, we didn't find a hand carved stamp until Jay's Mamacoke Island<br/>
which<br/>
        we found in March 2000.  I remember thinking " Wow he made this out<br/>
of an eraser?!"<br/>
        Of course the abundance of store bought stamps in the beginning is<br/>
the reason Dan<br/>
        and I had store bought signature stamps for so long.  It was hard to<br/>
give them up!<br/>
<br/>
        The original Elaine and Jerry's Bluff stamp was a store bought<br/>
flower- I think a sunflower-<br/>
        but then I don't really know my flowers.<br/>

I'm about to drive from CT to Kansas and was hoping to pick up a few<br/>
easier boxes along the way.  Since I'm travelling with the<br/>
antiletterboxer, they will have to be fairly short walks, probably<br/>
half and hour or so.  a little more might be ok.  If anyone has<br/>
suggestions, I would sure appreciate them.<br/>
<br/>
Our route is as follows-<br/>
<br/>
Interstates all the way -<br/>
Hartford to Wilkes-Barre on I-84 then I-81 to I-80.<br/>
We will be on I-80 to Youngstown, OH and taking I-76 (I think)to<br/>

homework to find the box instead of spelling out every freeway exit<br/>
and cross street just to get to the parking lot where the trail<br/>
starts. Its all part of the thrill of the hunt, to pull out the<br/>
roadmap and find the way to that park or that trailhead, not really<br/>
knowing what to expect there. I think its possible to make an elegant<br/>
and straightforward clue without cluttering it up with unnecessary<br/>
information. Whether its an easy or hard clue, it can still be written<br/>
simply and clearly.  Anyway, thats just what I find enjoyable about these<br/>
kinds of treasure hunts. What does everyone else think?<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would definitely have to agree!  I like the thrill of finding all boxes,<br/>
however, there seems, as my choir director says, that "it is a very<br/>
satisfying thing" when I find an especially difficult box.  Mystery boxes<br/>
especially have this thrill for me, especially ones like Dancing Men in RI,<br/>
Going Downhill in RI, Some of Jay Drew's mystery boxes...(if I could spell<br/>
them correctly, I would name them, however the website for CT is down and I<br/>
can't get the correct spellings), legerdemaine boxes etc....  When I found<br/>
Dancing Men, I felt like I won the lottery!<br/>

&gt; I have found boxes full of water,cracked boxes,full logbooks and other<br/>
&gt; things.I just thought it would be easier if we had a place to jog them<br/>
&gt; down.I know we look out for each others boxes now the best we can,but I<br/>
&gt; thought a list would be better<br/>
<br/>
No prob Lenny.... With the winter we've had, most of the boxes here have had<br/>
water, especially if they were below the snow line (which at times here in<br/>
CT<br/>
was at 30 inches).  I know that I cherish the e-mails which come on the list<br/>
and to me directly concerning the status of my boxes.  That way, I can keep<br/>
up on them, without checking on them as much, especially if they are<br/>
reported<br/>
in fine shape.  I have three boxes out of state, two of which I don't get to<br/>
check on at all (Wanda and Pete, and Amanda from Seattle can probably relate<br/>
on this one).  One has been unofficially reported missing, from someone<br/>
looking for the box for the first time.  Since it is in VA, I can not go and<br/>
check on it, and though the Potomac may have taken the box, until someone<br/>
who<br/>
has previously found the box goes and checks on it for me, I really don't<br/>
know the status.  All I can do is put a post on the clues that it may be<br/>
missing.<br/>

There are no boxes in Yellowstone itself.  It's a National Park and <br/>
they are not allowed there.  However, there are some virtual <br/>
geocaches in the park if you're really jonesing for a hunt, and as <br/>
Rustypuff mentioned, there is the Thatched Mystery letterbox that we <br/>
placed nearby back in September.  We've not heard a peep about it <br/>
since we placed it, though, so we can't guarantee it's still there.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Does anyone know who owns [the Elaine and Jerry's Bluff] box?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This box was placed by the EMS Waterford staff, June '98.  I believe<br/>
&gt; it was the first one they placed, and thus the first in CT (post<br/>
&gt; Smithsonian era), but I would have to check my records to confirm <br/>
that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I remember when I found that box, there were 37 entries in the <br/>
logbook,<br/>
&gt; which was a staggering amount in those days.  It was prolly more <br/>
than<br/>
&gt; entries then in all other logbooks around the country combined.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hand carved stamps were extremely rare in those days, especially in<br/>
&gt; CT.  I'd have to check if was hand carved -- if someone wants a <br/>
scan,<br/>
&gt; e-mail me, as it might be worth carving a replacement as it is a<br/>
&gt; historic box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers<br/>

clues.Obscured<br/>

it the<br/>

it,and I<br/>
&gt; know a fellow letterboxer reported 6 months ago and it was not<br/>
&gt; replaced.Maybe the owner of the box did not see the posting about <br/>
their<br/>
&gt; box,that is why I said if we had a list we could check it.I myself <br/>
have 50<br/>
&gt; boxes out there and i,m starting to learn its not easy to check <br/>
them all the<br/>

&gt; down.I know we look out for each others boxes now the best we <br/>

added fuel<br/>
&gt; to the fire because we were tired,we have been boxing all day fri-<br/>
sat and it<br/>
&gt; was near the end of the day.I,m sure that the box is there,we just <br/>
need to<br/>

&gt; Ahhhh .... now that makes sense.  A place to notify a box owner that<br/>
&gt; their box needs maintenance.  *nods*  :) However, I think that if <br/>
Wes<br/>
&gt; can work it out so that the box owner can be contacted by secure<br/>
&gt; email via the clue page, it might eliminate the need for such a <br/>
place.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As you said - we look out for each others boxes now the best we <br/>
can -<br/>
&gt; but some notification system would be a really helpful solution.  We<br/>
&gt; need to remember that not all letterboxers read and subscribe to <br/>
this<br/>
&gt; list.  None of my local friends who letterbox use this list (for<br/>
&gt; example).  Also, if someone posted a problem to another "place" that<br/>
&gt; might not get checked regularly, either.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the solution might be an easier way to contact the box <br/>
owner,<br/>
&gt; rather than to just post publicly about problem boxes.  *shrug*<br/>

&gt; &gt; I disagree that the mystique is the essential thing.  The <br/>
essential<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing for me is getting out and seeing new places and enjoying new<br/>
&gt; &gt; hikes and not taking forever deciphering vague clues to find the<br/>
&gt; &gt; box.  This is especially important for me since my family is not<br/>
&gt; &gt; "into" letterboxing like I am, so if I manage to drag them with <br/>
me I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don't want to waste too much time deciphering clues while they<br/>
&gt; &gt; get impatient and like the hobby even less.  Also, if I visit<br/>
&gt; another<br/>
&gt; &gt; state and want to letterbox, I don't usually have much time so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don't want to waste it looking for boxes with vague directions and<br/>
&gt; &gt; clues.  In fact, I will avoid even looking if they look vague<br/>
&gt; online.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That said, I do agree that some boxes should be harder to find for<br/>
&gt; &gt; those times when you want the challenge.  I just would be less<br/>
&gt; likely<br/>
&gt; &gt; to try for those than others.  I guess I just prefer the physical<br/>
&gt; &gt; challenge of finding boxes rather than the mental one.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe I'm part of the minority, too, but I wholeheartedly agree<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the mystique is the essential thing. Lets hear it for the golden<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; triangle of treasure hunting! For me, the stamp and logbook in <br/>
my<br/>
&gt; &gt; hand<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is a surprise and reward for the journey. It isn't as much fun<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've seen them online even before I've even left the house.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Likewise I prefer the minimalist clues that make you do a little<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; homework to find the box instead of spelling out every freeway<br/>
&gt; exit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and cross street just to get to the parking lot where the trail<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; starts. Its all part of the thrill of the hunt, to pull out the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; roadmap and find the way to that park or that trailhead, not<br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; knowing what to expect there. I think its possible to make an<br/>
&gt; &gt; elegant<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and straightforward clue without cluttering it up with <br/>
unnecessary<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; information. Whether its an easy or hard clue, it can still be<br/>
&gt; &gt; written<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; simply and clearly.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, thats just what I find enjoyable about these kinds of<br/>
&gt; &gt; treasure<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hunts. What does everyone else think?<br/>

&gt; This past mothers day week-end we had two days of family <br/>
letterboxing...two<br/>
&gt; from Anchorage, four from Montana and our daughter, her 5 yr old <br/>
and her<br/>
&gt; nine mo old from the Issaquah area.  Friday we found Amanda`s <br/>
Flaming Guyser<br/>
&gt; box.  We went one a long wild goose chase for a non Amanda box.  <br/>
Saturday we<br/>
&gt; went on a great hike and found Amandas two Holloween letterboxes.  <br/>
We let<br/>
&gt; the five yr old look behind the trees and under the rocks for the <br/>
boxes.<br/>
&gt; Now he and his mom are hooked.  They are lucky as the are zillions <br/>
of boxes<br/>
&gt; to be found in the Seattle area.  Here in Montana boxes almost do <br/>
not exist,<br/>
&gt; although we are trying to change that.  Finding is more fun than <br/>
planting!<br/>
&gt; So, our hats off to Amanda who made the hunt sucessfull.  Rockmover <br/>

&gt; I don't see this box (found on the old site) listed for Central Ohio<br/>
&gt; (Franklin County) on the new site.  I collected this box today, so I<br/>
&gt; know it is still active.<br/>

&gt; What got me mad is when I found a box with no stamp in it,and I <br/>
know a<br/>
&gt; fellow letterboxer reported 6 months ago and it was not <br/>
replaced.Maybe the<br/>
&gt; owner of the box did not see the posting about their box,that is <br/>
why I said<br/>
&gt; if we had a list we could check it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are the owners of the Covered Bridge box.  Yes, Butterfly told <br/>
us in<br/>
&gt; January that the stamp was missing.  Unfortunately, we just have <br/>
not had the<br/>
&gt; time to go out and replace it yet.  So, if anyone else is planning <br/>
on going<br/>
&gt; to find that box, you may want to wait until at least June when we <br/>
can get<br/>
&gt; back and put a new stamp in.<br/>

&gt; I prefer the easy clues also especially since we're new at it! But <br/>
I mostly<br/>
&gt; enjoy letterboxing because it's a great activity to do with my boys <br/>
and we<br/>
&gt; all have fun hunting down boxes together and we love to be <br/>
outdoors!  I<br/>
&gt; don't want to have to struggle with clues...I want it to just be <br/>
fun!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I do bow to those who can puzzle out the really difficult clues <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; solve them!  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; This box was placed by the EMS Waterford staff, June '98.  I <br/>
believe<br/>
&gt; &gt; it was the first one they placed, and thus the first in CT (post<br/>
&gt; &gt; Smithsonian era), but I would have to check my records to confirm <br/>
that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         I think it was the 2nd box.  #1 was Misery Loves Company.  <br/>
It was<br/>
&gt; the also the<br/>
&gt;         2nd box Dan and I found way back in April of 1999.  Before <br/>
we even<br/>
&gt; had Max!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hand carved stamps were extremely rare in those days, especially <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; CT.  I'd have to check if was hand carved --<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         Yes, we didn't find a hand carved stamp until Jay's <br/>
Mamacoke Island<br/>
&gt; which<br/>
&gt;         we found in March 2000.  I remember thinking " Wow he made <br/>
this out<br/>
&gt; of an eraser?!"<br/>
&gt;         Of course the abundance of store bought stamps in the <br/>
beginning is<br/>
&gt; the reason Dan<br/>
&gt;         and I had store bought signature stamps for so long.  It <br/>
was hard to<br/>
&gt; give them up!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         The original Elaine and Jerry's Bluff stamp was a store <br/>
bought<br/>
&gt; flower- I think a sunflower-<br/>
&gt;         but then I don't really know my flowers.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;<likewise a="" clues="" do="" i="" little<br="" make="" minimalist="" prefer="" that="" the="" you="">
&gt; homework to find the box instead of spelling out every freeway exit<br/>
&gt; and cross street just to get to the parking lot where the trail<br/>
&gt; starts. Its all part of the thrill of the hunt, to pull out the<br/>
&gt; roadmap and find the way to that park or that trailhead, not really<br/>
&gt; knowing what to expect there. I think its possible to make an <br/>
elegant<br/>
&gt; and straightforward clue without cluttering it up with unnecessary<br/>
&gt; information. Whether its an easy or hard clue, it can still be <br/>
written<br/>
&gt; simply and clearly.  Anyway, thats just what I find enjoyable about <br/>
these<br/>
&gt; kinds of treasure hunts. What does everyone else think?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would definitely have to agree!  I like the thrill of finding all <br/>
boxes,<br/>
&gt; however, there seems, as my choir director says, that "it is a very<br/>
&gt; satisfying thing" when I find an especially difficult box.  Mystery <br/>
boxes<br/>
&gt; especially have this thrill for me, especially ones like Dancing <br/>
Men in RI,<br/>
&gt; Going Downhill in RI, Some of Jay Drew's mystery boxes...(if I <br/>
could spell<br/>
&gt; them correctly, I would name them, however the website for CT is <br/>
down and I<br/>
&gt; can't get the correct spellings), legerdemaine boxes etc....  When <br/>
I found<br/>
&gt; Dancing Men, I felt like I won the lottery!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have found boxes full of water,cracked boxes,full logbooks and <br/>
other<br/>
&gt; &gt; things.I just thought it would be easier if we had a place to jog <br/>
them<br/>
&gt; &gt; down.I know we look out for each others boxes now the best we <br/>
can,but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought a list would be better<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No prob Lenny.... With the winter we've had, most of the boxes here <br/>
have had<br/>
&gt; water, especially if they were below the snow line (which at times <br/>
here in<br/>
&gt; CT<br/>
&gt; was at 30 inches).  I know that I cherish the e-mails which come on <br/>
the list<br/>
&gt; and to me directly concerning the status of my boxes.  That way, I <br/>
can keep<br/>
&gt; up on them, without checking on them as much, especially if they are<br/>
&gt; reported<br/>
&gt; in fine shape.  I have three boxes out of state, two of which I <br/>
don't get to<br/>
&gt; check on at all (Wanda and Pete, and Amanda from Seattle can <br/>
probably relate<br/>
&gt; on this one).  One has been unofficially reported missing, from <br/>
someone<br/>
&gt; looking for the box for the first time.  Since it is in VA, I can <br/>
not go and<br/>
&gt; check on it, and though the Potomac may have taken the box, until <br/>
someone<br/>
&gt; who<br/>
&gt; has previously found the box goes and checks on it for me, I really <br/>
don't<br/>
&gt; know the status.  All I can do is put a post on the clues that it <br/>
may be<br/>
&gt; missing.<br/>

Here's the shameless plug to go with it.  I planted a new series just last<br/>
weekend.  It is a pretty  simple set in Island Park, ID.  Island Park is<br/>
super close to West Yellowstone  If you are coming near that entrance,  feel<br/>
free to stop by Island Park too.  You will be the official first to find one<br/>
of my ID boxes (There aren't any other Eastern ID boxers yet)  The box<br/>
series is called the Big Springs Series.  I think this link will get you<br/>
there (or check the map).<br/>

If you are interested, here is another link to the Ochre Rock Series:<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/WY/OchreRock/<br/>
<br/>
Let me know when you are coming.  Like I said, I have been wanting to go up<br/>
there to find the boxes anyway, and I would love an excuse for an exchange.<br/>

I think the boxes you are referring to are not posted on either<br/>
the old or new clue site.  They are called the Ochre Rock Series<br/>
on Ryan Carpenter's web page:<br/>

&gt; &gt; Does anyone know who owns [the Elaine and Jerry's Bluff] box?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This box was placed by the EMS Waterford staff, June '98.  I believe<br/>
&gt; it was the first one they placed, and thus the first in CT (post<br/>
&gt; Smithsonian era), but I would have to check my records to confirm<br/>
that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I remember when I found that box, there were 37 entries in the<br/>
logbook,<br/>
&gt; which was a staggering amount in those days.  It was prolly more<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; entries then in all other logbooks around the country combined.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hand carved stamps were extremely rare in those days, especially in<br/>
&gt; CT.  I'd have to check if was hand carved -- if someone wants a<br/>
scan,<br/>
&gt; e-mail me, as it might be worth carving a replacement as it is a<br/>
&gt; historic box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers<br/>

&gt; I was more referring to broken down boxes more than obscured<br/>
clues.Obscured<br/>
&gt; clues well you can always go back and try again if you did not find<br/>
it the<br/>
&gt; first time.What got me mad is when I found a box with no stamp in<br/>
it,and I<br/>
&gt; know a fellow letterboxer reported 6 months ago and it was not<br/>
&gt; replaced.Maybe the owner of the box did not see the posting about<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; box,that is why I said if we had a list we could check it.I myself<br/>
have 50<br/>
&gt; boxes out there and i,m starting to learn its not easy to check<br/>
them all the<br/>
&gt; time.I have found boxes full of water,cracked boxes,full logbooks<br/>
and other<br/>
&gt; things.I just thought it would be easier if we had a place to jog<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; down.I know we look out for each others boxes now the best we<br/>
can,but I<br/>
&gt; thought a list would be better.As far as obscured clues,that just<br/>
added fuel<br/>
&gt; to the fire because we were tired,we have been boxing all day fri-<br/>
sat and it<br/>
&gt; was near the end of the day.I,m sure that the box is there,we just<br/>
need to<br/>
&gt; relax regroup and rethink we will get it next time.And for the<br/>
obscured<br/>
&gt; part, I Apologize Especially to Music Woman aka.Pam.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ahhhh .... now that makes sense.  A place to notify a box owner that<br/>
&gt; their box needs maintenance.  *nods*  :) However, I think that if<br/>
Wes<br/>
&gt; can work it out so that the box owner can be contacted by secure<br/>
&gt; email via the clue page, it might eliminate the need for such a<br/>
place.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As you said - we look out for each others boxes now the best we<br/>
can -<br/>
&gt; but some notification system would be a really helpful solution.  We<br/>
&gt; need to remember that not all letterboxers read and subscribe to<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; list.  None of my local friends who letterbox use this list (for<br/>
&gt; example).  Also, if someone posted a problem to another "place" that<br/>
&gt; might not get checked regularly, either.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the solution might be an easier way to contact the box<br/>
owner,<br/>
&gt; rather than to just post publicly about problem boxes.  *shrug*<br/>

&gt; &gt; I disagree that the mystique is the essential thing.  The<br/>
essential<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing for me is getting out and seeing new places and enjoying new<br/>
&gt; &gt; hikes and not taking forever deciphering vague clues to find the<br/>
&gt; &gt; box.  This is especially important for me since my family is not<br/>
&gt; &gt; "into" letterboxing like I am, so if I manage to drag them with<br/>
me I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don't want to waste too much time deciphering clues while they<br/>
&gt; &gt; get impatient and like the hobby even less.  Also, if I visit<br/>
&gt; another<br/>
&gt; &gt; state and want to letterbox, I don't usually have much time so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don't want to waste it looking for boxes with vague directions and<br/>
&gt; &gt; clues.  In fact, I will avoid even looking if they look vague<br/>
&gt; online.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That said, I do agree that some boxes should be harder to find for<br/>
&gt; &gt; those times when you want the challenge.  I just would be less<br/>
&gt; likely<br/>
&gt; &gt; to try for those than others.  I guess I just prefer the physical<br/>
&gt; &gt; challenge of finding boxes rather than the mental one.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mapping becomes more imperfect.  This represents two sides<br/>

&gt; &gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I call the golden triangle of treasure hunting.  The thrill of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; discovery<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occurs when these imperfections are experienced.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  [...]<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe I'm part of the minority, too, but I wholeheartedly agree<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the mystique is the essential thing. Lets hear it for the golden<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; triangle of treasure hunting! For me, the stamp and logbook in<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; &gt; hand<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is a surprise and reward for the journey. It isn't as much fun<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've seen them online even before I've even left the house.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Likewise I prefer the minimalist clues that make you do a little<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; homework to find the box instead of spelling out every freeway<br/>
&gt; exit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and cross street just to get to the parking lot where the trail<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; starts. Its all part of the thrill of the hunt, to pull out the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; roadmap and find the way to that park or that trailhead, not<br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; knowing what to expect there. I think its possible to make an<br/>
&gt; &gt; elegant<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and straightforward clue without cluttering it up with<br/>
unnecessary<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; information. Whether its an easy or hard clue, it can still be<br/>
&gt; &gt; written<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; simply and clearly.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, thats just what I find enjoyable about these kinds of<br/>
&gt; &gt; treasure<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hunts. What does everyone else think?<br/>

&gt; &gt; of the famous letterboxers who've visited, and to make sure the<br/>
&gt; box is<br/>
&gt; &gt; well hidden in its proper place. But today it was completely<br/>
&gt; missing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I thought for a moment that letterboxers may have "borrowed" it<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; order to stamp up in a safer area, but half an hour later the box<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; still missing. Who could have found it by accident?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm not sure when I'll finish making a replacement, and not<br/>
&gt; sure where<br/>
&gt; &gt; to find a better hiding place that would not be discovered again,<br/>
&gt; now<br/>
&gt; &gt; that the secret spot has been compromised. So if you are<br/>
&gt; coming to<br/>
&gt; &gt; visit downtown Chicago and looking forward to a tour of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Underground, sorry to let you down.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; This past mothers day week-end we had two days of family<br/>
letterboxing...two<br/>
&gt; from Anchorage, four from Montana and our daughter, her 5 yr old<br/>
and her<br/>
&gt; nine mo old from the Issaquah area.  Friday we found Amanda`s<br/>
Flaming Guyser<br/>
&gt; box.  We went one a long wild goose chase for a non Amanda box.<br/>
Saturday we<br/>
&gt; went on a great hike and found Amandas two Holloween letterboxes.<br/>
We let<br/>
&gt; the five yr old look behind the trees and under the rocks for the<br/>
boxes.<br/>
&gt; Now he and his mom are hooked.  They are lucky as the are zillions<br/>
of boxes<br/>
&gt; to be found in the Seattle area.  Here in Montana boxes almost do<br/>
not exist,<br/>
&gt; although we are trying to change that.  Finding is more fun than<br/>
planting!<br/>
&gt; So, our hats off to Amanda who made the hunt sucessfull.  Rockmover<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; Quiltmaker.  F5  P7<br/>

&gt; What got me mad is when I found a box with no stamp in it,and I<br/>
know a<br/>
&gt; fellow letterboxer reported 6 months ago and it was not<br/>
replaced.Maybe the<br/>
&gt; owner of the box did not see the posting about their box,that is<br/>
why I said<br/>
&gt; if we had a list we could check it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are the owners of the Covered Bridge box.  Yes, Butterfly told<br/>
us in<br/>
&gt; January that the stamp was missing.  Unfortunately, we just have<br/>
not had the<br/>
&gt; time to go out and replace it yet.  So, if anyone else is planning<br/>
on going<br/>
&gt; to find that box, you may want to wait until at least June when we<br/>
can get<br/>
&gt; back and put a new stamp in.<br/>

&gt; &gt; This box was placed by the EMS Waterford staff, June '98.  I<br/>
believe<br/>
&gt; &gt; it was the first one they placed, and thus the first in CT (post<br/>
&gt; &gt; Smithsonian era), but I would have to check my records to confirm<br/>
that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         I think it was the 2nd box.  #1 was Misery Loves Company.<br/>
It was<br/>
&gt; the also the<br/>
&gt;         2nd box Dan and I found way back in April of 1999.  Before<br/>
we even<br/>
&gt; had Max!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hand carved stamps were extremely rare in those days, especially<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; CT.  I'd have to check if was hand carved --<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         Yes, we didn't find a hand carved stamp until Jay's<br/>
Mamacoke Island<br/>
&gt; which<br/>
&gt;         we found in March 2000.  I remember thinking " Wow he made<br/>
this out<br/>
&gt; of an eraser?!"<br/>
&gt;         Of course the abundance of store bought stamps in the<br/>
beginning is<br/>
&gt; the reason Dan<br/>
&gt;         and I had store bought signature stamps for so long.  It<br/>
was hard to<br/>
&gt; give them up!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         The original Elaine and Jerry's Bluff stamp was a store<br/>
bought<br/>
&gt; flower- I think a sunflower-<br/>
&gt;         but then I don't really know my flowers.<br/>

&gt; homework to find the box instead of spelling out every freeway exit<br/>
&gt; and cross street just to get to the parking lot where the trail<br/>
&gt; starts. Its all part of the thrill of the hunt, to pull out the<br/>
&gt; roadmap and find the way to that park or that trailhead, not really<br/>
&gt; knowing what to expect there. I think its possible to make an<br/>
elegant<br/>
&gt; and straightforward clue without cluttering it up with unnecessary<br/>
&gt; information. Whether its an easy or hard clue, it can still be<br/>
written<br/>
&gt; simply and clearly.  Anyway, thats just what I find enjoyable about<br/>
these<br/>
&gt; kinds of treasure hunts. What does everyone else think?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would definitely have to agree!  I like the thrill of finding all<br/>
boxes,<br/>
&gt; however, there seems, as my choir director says, that "it is a very<br/>
&gt; satisfying thing" when I find an especially difficult box.  Mystery<br/>
boxes<br/>
&gt; especially have this thrill for me, especially ones like Dancing<br/>
Men in RI,<br/>
&gt; Going Downhill in RI, Some of Jay Drew's mystery boxes...(if I<br/>
could spell<br/>
&gt; them correctly, I would name them, however the website for CT is<br/>
down and I<br/>
&gt; can't get the correct spellings), legerdemaine boxes etc....  When<br/>
I found<br/>

can,but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought a list would be better<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No prob Lenny.... With the winter we've had, most of the boxes here<br/>
have had<br/>
&gt; water, especially if they were below the snow line (which at times<br/>
here in<br/>
&gt; CT<br/>
&gt; was at 30 inches).  I know that I cherish the e-mails which come on<br/>
the list<br/>
&gt; and to me directly concerning the status of my boxes.  That way, I<br/>
can keep<br/>
&gt; up on them, without checking on them as much, especially if they are<br/>
&gt; reported<br/>
&gt; in fine shape.  I have three boxes out of state, two of which I<br/>
don't get to<br/>
&gt; check on at all (Wanda and Pete, and Amanda from Seattle can<br/>
probably relate<br/>
&gt; on this one).  One has been unofficially reported missing, from<br/>
someone<br/>
&gt; looking for the box for the first time.  Since it is in VA, I can<br/>
not go and<br/>
&gt; check on it, and though the Potomac may have taken the box, until<br/>
someone<br/>
&gt; who<br/>
&gt; has previously found the box goes and checks on it for me, I really<br/>
don't<br/>
&gt; know the status.  All I can do is put a post on the clues that it<br/>
may be<br/>
&gt; missing.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is anyone else having trouble accessing clues on the site?  I can't<br/>
get to<br/>
&gt; anything from the map or the new search engine.  It sometimes goes<br/>
to a page<br/>
&gt; with the breakup of the state sections, but anytime I try to get to<br/>
a page<br/>
&gt; that has actual letterboxes listed, it tells me that page is not<br/>
available.<br/>
&gt; Are the webmasters revamping things this time of day?<br/>

&gt; I would contact EMS in Waterford directly first.  They carry the<br/>
clues in<br/>
&gt; print out form in their store, and were the ones who planted the<br/>
box.  They<br/>
&gt; may not want you to change the location.<br/>
