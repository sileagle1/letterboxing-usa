Sebago, ME<br/>
Cumberland County<br/>
<br/>
Placed: July 6th, 2002, my 24th Birthday!!!<br/>
By:     Krink<br/>
Hiking: Easy to Moderate (my uncles 80 year old mother made it up, <br/>
personally I think she must've been one buff, tough lady!)<br/>
<br/>
Distance: 1/4 mile to trail, 1/4 mile to tower--with optional 3/4 <br/>
mile extra loop nature trail.<br/>
<br/>
Child-friendly hike AND clue.  There are many families and campers <br/>
that climb this "off the beaten track" mountain!<br/>
<br/>
To the Mountain:<br/>
Find your way to route 107 on the southwestern side of Sebago Lake.<br/>
Head northwest on route 107 away from the lake. <br/>
Take a left off of 107 onto Douglas Hill Road (brochure says it's <br/>
Dyke Mountain Road here).<br/>
Take another left onto Douglas Hill Rd./Douglas Mountain Road.<br/>
Temporary parking is up the road on the left until a permanent <br/>
parking area is established.   When paying the parking fee you should <br/>
be given a one-page map/brochure about the mountain.  Parking is $ 3 <br/>
for cars, $ 2 for motorcycles and $.50 per person for buses or large <br/>
vans with more than 10 people.  The mountain and lot close at 6 pm.  <br/>
Leashed pets are allowed.<br/>
<br/>
Please use caution if it's wet out.  Two large sections of the<br/>
trail <br/>
are rock ledges that are reasonable steep and will surely be very <br/>
slippery if wet.<br/>
