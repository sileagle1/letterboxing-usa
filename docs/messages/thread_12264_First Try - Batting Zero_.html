                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to put my two cents worth in here.  First,  I am here in downeast coastal Maine where letterboxes are not as plentiful as in some parts of the country.  Most of them have been planted by Legerdemaine, who writes his clues in riddle and makes a wonderfully fun and challenging hunt.  I have gone back as many as three or four times to finally get one box.  It just makes the final "capture" that much sweeter.  Don't be discouraged by the people who have been at this for quite a while or who live in areas with lots of boxes and who have huge "found" totals.  I have been playing at this game for about 8 or 9 months and have about a dozen or so finds.  Not very many, but I am happy with those and happy that there are still boxes in my area to be found.  The hikes and walks to find them have been delightful, taking me to parts of "my" island I had never been.  I love nabbing those boxes, but the journey to get to them has been every bit as enjoyable as the find.  Enjoy yourselves and don't give up!Memlili<br/>
