<br/>
In almost 90% of the yahoo groups I'm a member of (12 of them) there <br/>
is a designated moderator whose sole function is to send a personal <br/>
welcome out to each new member (off/onlist) that welcomes them <br/>
(above and beyond the "stock" automated message that new members get <br/>
compliments of yahoo). The email generally goes out within 72 hours <br/>
of a member joining. It's main focus is to "welcome" the newbie and <br/>
then gently remind them to check out any important "rules" of the <br/>
group in the groups files/FAQ's section. <br/>
<br/>
The moderators in a few of the groups have the authority to snip any <br/>
message thread that has been/become inflammatory and warns everyone <br/>
that future posts on that thread may be deleted at the moderators <br/>
discretion. The moderators must have the listowners permission <br/>
before snipping a specific thread though. There is no <br/>
active "censorship" of any other kind on the moderators part. But <br/>
then many of those list members know that flaming/nitpicking will <br/>
not be tolerated anyways and they are much more respectful as a <br/>
whole...or else they just must be taking it offlist where it should <br/>
be done anyways to avoid being "moderated/censored".<br/>
<br/>
Those same groups have moderators for specific things. They also <br/>
generally assign one type of moderator per 100-150 people since alot <br/>
of email can be generated with a large listmembership. The <br/>
moderators cover for each other if someone can't do their job for a <br/>
day or week due to personal circumstances. <br/>
<br/>
Types of moderators could include:<br/>
Welcome<br/>

  (Chats could be held weekly on a specific night of the week. With <br/>
two/three people agreeing to be the "chat host/moderators".)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All the lists send out short "automated" reminders concerning list <br/>
etiquette. There are also automated reminders for the various chats. <br/>
The ? of the week is always posted on Sunday/Monday and is generally <br/>
a non-inflammatory question that provokes postive discussion on the <br/>
subject. It could be based on something that may of come up in one <br/>
of the chats the week before or on any aspect of letterboxing in <br/>
general.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not suggesting that we need to be "censored" but quite frankly <br/>
sometimes an "open" forum can be to "open" and then the negativity <br/>
can run amook as we have occasionally seen here. We should all be <br/>
adult enough to "censor ourselves" but sometimes people dont' do <br/>
that until after the fact and by then the damage is done. It's not a <br/>
perfect world and by no means do I propose that my ideas would turn <br/>

I think these are some great ideas, however I think one of the <br/>
things to take into consideration here is that this is a talk list <br/>
for an outdoor hobby and the last thing I want and I can probably <br/>
guess the other moderators as well is more work to do in front of <br/>
the computer in order to get a group of people to behave as adults.  <br/>
I personally want to be able to go out and box without having to <br/>
worry about what the group decides to fight about today. I think <br/>
that instead of adding more work for the moderators to help everyone <br/>
act civil we simply need to start warning, moderating and kicking <br/>
people off the list for the ridiculous behavior that has been <br/>
exhibited here in the past. I know I for one am about ready to start <br/>
voting people off the Island.<br/>

<br/>
Quite on the contrary part of the moderators job is to help keep the <br/>
list running smoothly and these days that seems to be more precisely <br/>
helping people act accordingly, stopping personal attacks, and <br/>
asking people to stop being rude to each other, which to me is <br/>
pretty much all categorized as ridiculous behavior.  I do agree with <br/>
the sentiment however that everyone deserves a warning, however I <br/>
also think that everyone needs to realize that once you get that <br/>
warning all bets are off.  I believe it was Don that wrote me <br/>
recently and told me about his habits before posting to this group. <br/>
He called it the "Mike Tyson" approach. He said that before he hit <br/>
the send button he always asked himself, if Mike Tyson where here, <br/>
and I was saying this, would I get punched in the face? (Or <br/>
something to that effect) I thought it was just grand. Perhaps if <br/>
everyone else followed this long time letter boxers habits of re-<br/>
considering what they post before they post it we would have less <br/>
problems on the list. <br/>
<br/>
Just some more food for thought,<br/>

It might be well for some folks to revisit R.S Carpenter' course for <br/>
discourse  www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/Docs/Posting/<br/>
Miss Janet or General Hardass tutorials could certainly assist <br/>
anyone that is concerned about posting. Now if one is prone to <br/>
become engulfed in flames please read Miss Janet. If you have a <br/>
thick skin go for the General.<br/>
