  I have some placements planned that are too small for even a <br/>
  35mm microbox.  They are in very public places that I think would <br/>
  be fun to have letterboxes.  <br/>
  My plan is to hide the stamp in a magnetic box and include a <br/>
  password to a web site.<br/>
  The Letterboxer would get a stamp for their book and submit a <br/>
  graphic of their stamp to the web site/online guest book for <br/>

<br/>

As far as the purists go, there are geocache hybrids out there and <br/>
virtual letterboxes too, so it should be kosher.  (Especially since <br/>
geocaching seems to be one of the seven deadly sins around here ;))<br/>
