<br/>
Not only do individuals have different interests from each other, one <br/>
individual may have varying responses to the same stimulus in <br/>
different situations.  This morning I have been extremely amused with <br/>
these posts regarding numbers.  Another day I might have been <br/>
agitated and annoyed with them, avoiding the list for the next week.  <br/>
But last night I viewed "It's a Wonderful Life" on the 'big screen' <br/>
with a few of my family.  This 'feel good' movie blatantly shouts out <br/>
that numbers don't matter.  Sometimes we forget what does matter.  <br/>
BTW, this is the 21st post regarding numbers.<br/>
