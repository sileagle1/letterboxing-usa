I'm a french journalist for Thesaumag magazine.(magazine about <br/>
treasure hunts)<br/>
In France, letterboxing doesn't yet exist.<br/>
So I can't make photos of boxes and people on their hunt.<br/>
I'm looking for photos of boxes, stampes, people in their hunt to be <br/>
published... <br/>
But I'm sorry the magazine have no money to pay for them. If you <br/>
could help me and send me good photos, it would be a pleasure to send <br/>
you by mail the magazine after his publication if the photos are <br/>
choosen.<br/>
I think that that article coud launch letterboxing in France as the <br/>
Smithsonian did in 1998.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much for your help ! ;)))<br/>
