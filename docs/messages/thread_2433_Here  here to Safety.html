You're still not getting my point!  How can you guarantee that <br/>
everyone who pulls clues off the internet has one of your workshops <br/>
under their belt.  Everyone keeps talking about their own personal <br/>
safety procedures and that's great, but you're  missing what I'm <br/>
getting at.  <br/>
<br/>
Let me draw an analogy.  If this site were dedicated to some form of <br/>
sports hunting and our dialogue concentrated on different places <br/>
where the hunting was good, we'd be pretty much protected from <br/>
liability (unless we advocate breaking the law) since anyone who <br/>
wants to hunt almost always has to take a hunter safety course which <br/>
includes some wilderness survival and safety tips. Therefore, they <br/>
should know better.<br/>
<br/>
There's no qualifications to go letterboxing.  There's nothing to <br/>
stop a totally inexperienced person who basically doesn't know enough <br/>
to realize how little he knows from striking out, printout in hand, <br/>
into the woods and a situation he can't handle.  Can you be sure that <br/>
he's going to read through this whole list and get every piece of <br/>
your good advice before he sets out?  Why do you think that product <br/>
labels are so packed with instruction and warnings.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure that all of the dedicated letterboxers are no fools when it <br/>
comes to how to conduct themselves in the woods.   Something as <br/>
simple as stating estimated travel time should be possible without <br/>
spilling the beans.  <br/>
<br/>
For experienced people, it's sometimes a hassle to deal with rules <br/>
and regulations that are meant for less experienced people.  However, <br/>
the slight inconvenience of adding some extra details to the clues is <br/>
a lot better than having to have a qualification course and passwords<br/>
to access the clues.<br/>

Real good points by all, but really sad if the truth be told.<br/>
<br/>
I am working on a disclaimer to put on my clues. Goes something like this.<br/>
<br/>
CAUTION: Reading the following clues and attempting to find my letterbox is<br/>
dangerous and could result in mild headaches, sneezing, drowsiness, sore<br/>

Those that try to find as many boxes in one day or weekend that they <br/>
can are missing the whole point of letterboxing.  I feel it should be <br/>
an escape from the day to day RAT race so many of us are in; and I <br/>
can't figure out why anyone would turn boxing into a race too.  When <br/>
I place or search for a box I stop and smell the roses, watch a cloud <br/>
float through the sky, a bird soar through the air or just sit and <br/>
watch some ants busy at their chores. Quality not quantity is the  <br/>
slogan for my boxes. I place boxes in places that I've been and want <br/>
to lure other to those places to enjoy the surroundings there. As for <br/>
anyone that would trek into an unknown enviroment unprepaired would <br/>
fall into the category of "natural selection".<br/>
That's just my opinion I could be wrong!<br/>

   This letter will probably get some of you upset,<br/>
but hopefully it will get some of you thinking....<br/>
   I've been quiet for quite some time now, barely<br/>
getting out to hunt for boxes anymore, but manage one<br/>
here and there. I guess you could say I fall into the<br/>
category of... "when I find the box I find it, it's<br/>
out there somewhere...." (see Ray's Dilema.) <br/>
    I need no disclaimer to tell me that the wood's<br/>
are a dangerous place. People have died of<br/>
dehydration, starvation, inability-of navagation, and<br/>
in the worst case- animal mutilation. People are also<br/>
victims of violent crimes on major and not so major<br/>
trails. I've been night hiking, snow hiking, rain<br/>
hiking, snow at night hiking... even done letterboxes<br/>
by kayak... at night also... it's part of the<br/>
challenge. I have been blessed with an uncanny sense<br/>
of direction and the ability to sniff out boxes that<br/>
companions in my party couldnt find. I have an extreme<br/>
knowledge of woods- wisdom (moss doesnt always grow on<br/>
the north side of a tree). "The Ram" can attest to all<br/>
this, as he is my usual LB companion.<br/>
    I guess what it all boils down to is this: Expect<br/>
the worst and hope for the best. If a clue doesnt give<br/>
milage, plan for a major hike. You're a fool if you go<br/>
hiking in any terrain with sandals on and an even<br/>
bigger fool if you don't have water to drink.  Bring<br/>
more than you think you need, because your right..<br/>
you're going to need it. I've been "brainwashed" by a<br/>
fraternal organization for the last 20 or so years to<br/>
think... "Be Prepared"<br/>
    In this day and age we find people trying to shift<br/>
blame for their own actions, finding fault with clues<br/>
written by other people and blamming them for getting<br/>
you "lost". If the clue isn't clear, I don't/won't<br/>
follow it! And if I do get lost following a clue, I<br/>
figure it's just that much more of this great country<br/>
that I have seen that I might not have seen, if I<br/>
hadn't gotten lost.<br/>
    So remember, the blame lies solely upon yourself<br/>
for your actions, assume some responsiblity for the<br/>
times, when your inexperience gets you lost.... or<br/>
hurt. I've been both cold and wet on more than one<br/>
camping trip to realize that the equipment I had wasnt<br/>
what I needed. Remember this: Be Prepared for your own<br/>
inexperience, because after you've done something<br/>
once... you've now gained that experience; you know<br/>
what to expect, next time.<br/>
    And by the way... a survival-first aid kit, is a<br/>
good first step for assuming self responsibilty. It is<br/>
a very good start to a safe letterboxing trip.<br/>
   Enjoy the next time you're out in the woods, day or<br/>
night!<br/>

others. That competitive spirit is hard to squelch in some folks and that IS<br/>
their escape. Go figure but it somehow works for them.<br/>
<br/>
My attraction to letterboxing is the same as your. Go slow and sit on my<br/>
butt and watch the world and nature go by, move a short distance and repeat.<br/>
It is a rigorous pace, I know! I used to backpack many years ago but quick<br/>
when my back gave out. I enjoy bird watching and letterboxing just gives me<br/>
a reason to visit more places. I am placing boxes in or near my favorite<br/>
places in Tacoma, only two so far.  I'm really new, been out twice so far<br/>
and found 3 boxes. The two at one time were placed near by and we drove 150+<br/>
miles to find them.<br/>
<br/>
Different strokes for different folks.<br/>

&gt; I don't mean to rant but...<br/>
&gt; Those that try to find as many boxes in one day or weekend that they<br/>
&gt; can are missing the whole point of letterboxing.  I feel it should be<br/>
&gt; an escape from the day to day RAT race so many of us are in; and I<br/>
&gt; can't figure out why anyone would turn boxing into a race too.  When<br/>
&gt; I place or search for a box I stop and smell the roses, watch a cloud<br/>
&gt; float through the sky, a bird soar through the air or just sit and<br/>
&gt; watch some ants busy at their chores. Quality not quantity is the<br/>
&gt; slogan for my boxes. I place boxes in places that I've been and want<br/>
&gt; to lure other to those places to enjoy the surroundings there. As for<br/>
&gt; anyone that would trek into an unknown enviroment unprepaired would<br/>
&gt; fall into the category of "natural selection".<br/>
&gt; That's just my opinion I could be wrong!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S.  Glenn would you mind if I were to use your disclaimer in my box<br/>
&gt; clues.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; You're still not getting my point!  How can you guarantee that<br/>
&gt; everyone who pulls clues off the internet has one of your workshops<br/>
&gt; under their belt.  Everyone keeps talking about their own personal<br/>
&gt; safety procedures and that's great, but you're  missing what I'm<br/>
&gt; getting at.<br/>
<br/>
I think we get your point... But it all boils down to "I cannot<br/>
hold the hand of every self-proclaimed outdoorsman on the planet".<br/>
We post disclaimers, warnings, try to indicate dangerous conditions<br/>
as well as possible.  How much more can we do?  It would kinda<br/>
take the fun out of it if we needed to personally escort each<br/>
searcher to our boxes (and imagine how busy the Drews would find<br/>
themselves!  <g>).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; There's no qualifications to go letterboxing.  There's nothing to<br/>
&gt; stop a totally inexperienced person who basically doesn't know enough<br/>
&gt; to realize how little he knows from striking out, printout in hand,<br/>
&gt; into the woods and a situation he can't handle.<br/>
<br/>
Omitting my personal preference for "applied Darwinism" in such<br/>
cases, we simply have no control whatsoever over the situation<br/>
you describe.  I agree it may exist as a very real possibility;<br/>
a person might also decide they can jump out of a speeding car<br/>
to no ill effect, "like in the movies".  They can try to jump<br/>
off their roof with a bed-sheet as a parachute.  They can try<br/>
crossing six lanes of traffic during rush-hour.  People have to<br/>
live their own lives, no one else can do it for them.<br/>
<br/>
Shall we abandon our hobby out of fear that some morons less<br/>
safety-conscious than ourselves might get hurt?  SCREW 'EM!<br/>
I've gotten lost in the woods a few times.  I've even felt<br/>
*really* pissed for a few hours at various clue-providers for<br/>
not clearly indicating the way out of the woods.  But in each<br/>
and every case, do you know who I had to blame for getting lost?<br/>
Only myself.  Every single time I've gotten lost, it resuted<br/>
from me getting lazy.  I didn't bring a map ("Only a half-hour<br/>
stroll!"), didn't mark my starting position ("Well, I saw a<br/>
stream on our left..."), didn't bring enough food/water and just<br/>
got too tired to think straight ("Only a half-hour stroll!" <g>),<br/>
or some similar really stupid error.  In a more dangerous climate<br/>
than southern New England, yes, i might even have ended up a<br/>
snack for some larger critter.  But I would *STILL* have had<br/>
only myself to blame for it.<br/>
<br/>
My concern in this matter extends as far as providing a<br/>
disclaimer (and doing my best to write "decent" clues, of<br/>
course).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Why do you think that product labels are so packed with<br/>
&gt; instruction and warnings.<br/>
<br/>
The same reason we have mandatory seat-belt laws, and people<br/>
getting rich by spilling unlabelled hot beverages on themselves,<br/>
and people with the ever-ready cry of "poor me, the innocent<br/>
victim" poised at the edge of their lips.<br/>
<br/>
CYA, and let people do as they will.<br/>
