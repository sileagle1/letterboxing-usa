I've recently seen a few posts from you on Rocky Mountain stuff <br/>
(boxers in Colo, Rocky Mtn. Gathering) etc.<br/>
<br/>
We do have a small, quiet list for those of us in the region.  It <br/>
reaches from Northern NM, to Cadenza up in Idaho (your area?)  Please <br/>
join us if you like.<br/>
<br/>
RMLetterboxing is the name of the yahoogroup.  Feel Free to pass it <br/>
along to anyone you like.<br/>
<br/>
Oh ... and JelyBean, Guara and others are in C Springs.  Last time I <br/>
was at Little Feet it looked as if it was time to change out the <br/>
log.  Perhaps one of them could mail you the log and replace it with <br/>
a new one?  Great location, by the way.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Autumn<br/>
(in Denver warming her frozen toes by the fire tonight)<br/>
