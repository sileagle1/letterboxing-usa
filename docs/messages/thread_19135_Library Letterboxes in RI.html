FYI....there are three boxes actually shelved in the Jamestown Philomenian Library.  Kudos to the von der Insels for some greast clues and even nifitier boxes! ;)  There is also one box shelved in the West Warwick Public Library. (The clue is listed as "Inquiring Minds" in Kent County.) I've also heard that there is one in the Charlestown Library but I've never seen a clue for it.  I've gotten all of the "letterbooks" mentioned above.  The librarians control the one in the West Warwick Public Library and it was a little strange to be letterboxing so obviously....<br/>
<br/>
Also, in our quest for Wanda and Pete's "Dancing Men", we introduced several people in another town in South County to letterboxing.  One woman spoke of being on the board at the local library and said to watch for clues there.  (E-mail me at playschoolteach at yahoo dot com if you want to know what town..."Dancing Men" wasn't there any way but I'm trying hard to be a good newbie and not give it away! *LOL*)  Other than that, I've not heard anything about ALL libraries hosting letterbooks....cool idea, though!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails......Kerri<br/>

There's an old Quest Box (that I replaced) at the Charlestown Library (which <br/>
is called Cross Mills Library).  You can find the clues online with the other <br/>
Charlestown RI clues.<br/>
