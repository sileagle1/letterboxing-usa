You guys keep putting boxes out in the west and I'll keep it up over <br/>
here in the east.  I guess we'll meet in the middle. Maybe pick up <br/>
some help along the way.<br/>

Have fun and if you ever come east, there's at least three boxes <br/>

Yes I saw your post. Actually I saw it on the Iowa page on the <br/>
website. I was in shock.  I think that's great.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of work to be done to make Iowa a fun state to <br/>
letterbox in.<br/>
<br/>
But it will catch on.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to visit your box someday, but I don't think I've been that <br/>
way in my whole life. I don't venture west of Des Moines too often. <br/>
Unless of course I'm going to West Des Moines.<br/>
