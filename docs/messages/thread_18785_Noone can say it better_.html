Sure, it hurts to think my really spiffy A Major Award hitchhiker got trashed right after I put it out, and no one even got a chance to see it!  Heck, I thought it was my best effort so far.<br/>

Life's like that.  As long as I'm not deployed to Iraq, I can take anything else in stride.  Have some sense of proportion.  My parents sent nine children out into the world - we can show some fortitude putting out boxes of stamps.<br/>

Love like it never hurts.  Dance like no one is watching.  (And you other guys stop beating up on people who asked questions just because you've already had that question answered for you.)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, it's true; Dave and I went to the last known site of teen booklovers LB in Coventry and all we found was a cairn of rocks. We can only suppose that "A Major Award" HH has disappeared forever. If anyone has heard anything about this hitchhiker, please contact us. If it is truly gone, then I think that Dave has plans to replace it (He really did like the idea - he's a real Jean Shepard fan from way back). By the way, Dave placed another Hitchiker on the path yesterday - "The Lucky Pig" HH. May fortune smile upon it's seekers.<br/>
