the state... but a lot of the ones in South East CT were placed by <br/>
EMS staff (i.e. Misery,Ray's Dilemma, Elaine and Jerry's, Walk in <br/>
Whitehall, Elephant Walk, Poquetannuck Jaunt, etc).  I've emailed Jay <br/>
about this and perhaps someone could make a call to the Waterford EMS <br/>
store and see what they'd like to do?  I know Misery was pulled for <br/>
rehab. Also Bluff Point was in bad shape and I have not been back to <br/>
see if it has been restored.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone know who "The Ram" is? - Lots of boxes from him on there...<br/>
<br/>
Also - just a note - it would be nice for everyone to try to get <br/>
these boxes and give a report on box condition sometime soon. Then we <br/>
really can weed out "missing" from "abandoned" and maybe make some <br/>
headway for the webmasters (who have done great work on the new site <br/>
so far!).<br/>

I agree this would be a great time to update clue pages (not delete<br/>
them) if they are missing or when they were last found.  Just<br/>
add a Status Line on the clue page (e.g. Alive (07/10/03) or <br/>
Missing (07/10/03). <br/>
