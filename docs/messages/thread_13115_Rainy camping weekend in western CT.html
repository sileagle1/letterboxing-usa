<br/>
Binx and I went camping for Memorial Day weekend at Black Rock State <br/>
Park. Despite (or perhaps including!) the wet weather, we had a <br/>
wonderful time enjoying the beautiful natural scenery and wildlife in <br/>
this area...and found several boxes of course! All boxes in great <br/>
condition except as noted:<br/>
<br/>
-Pitch Reservoir<br/>
-Steep Rock (saw a female wild turkey roosting way way up in an <br/>
evergreen!)<br/>
-Bee Brook<br/>
-Unicorn Forest<br/>
-Mt.Tom (stamp backing is broken but stamp works fine)<br/>
-White Woods series(Alain's box is cracked and the book only had one <br/>
blank page left. May also needs a new logbook.)<br/>
-Matatuck State Forest (ink pad is missing its cover)<br/>
-Composer series (Back on the Rock's box is badly cracked although <br/>
it's inside a large ziploc. What a beautiful area!)<br/>
-Paradise Lost<br/>
-Claddagh<br/>
-Cunningham Tower<br/>
-St.Veronica<br/>
-Wild Walk series<br/>
<br/>
We found a couple hitchhikers as well which I'll mention in a <br/>
separate posting. Many thanks to all who placed all of these boxes!<br/>

Thanks for the heads up on Alain and May.  We'll try to get out there this <br/>
week, if we can to put new log books.<br/>
