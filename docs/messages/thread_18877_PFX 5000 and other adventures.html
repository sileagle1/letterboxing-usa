                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,all! Haven't been posting or lurking in ages, so hope those of you <br/>
who might have some passing interest in "statistics" won't mind if I <br/>
expound upon a few of my more recent adventures. After the wonderful <br/>
May Day Gathering a couple of weeks ago at Quaddick State Park in CT, <br/>
I did a quick update of my box count and found that I was only about <br/>
75 boxes away from reaching PFX 5000! I also noted in looking back <br/>
through my "done lists" that on June 1st of last year I was just <br/>
reaching F2500 at "Universal Language" in VA, so then I started <br/>
thinking about how cool it would be to find 2000 boxes in one year! <br/>
So there I was suddenly with 2 new "personal goals" (and, as anyone <br/>
who knows me knows, I much prefer those over "competitive" ones!:-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm happy to report that I managed to complete both my goals <br/>
in "record time" - that is, well ahead of my planned "schedule", <br/>
since at first I was thinking that maybe I could reach them by the <br/>
end of this month, and here it turns out that I reached them both, <br/>
not only on the very same day (May 10th), but at the very same box!!!<br/>
That box was "His Growth", a RI mystery, which also seemed especially <br/>
appropriate since Pete and I have always used 3 trees and a sun as <br/>
our signature stamp, and that was almost the only clue to that <br/>
particular mystery! (even though it has nothing to do with us!) <br/>
Anyhow, here are a couple of the adventures I had along the way...<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after the May Day Gathering, I decided to make a letterboxing <br/>
run over to western CT to pick up a few of the more recent boxes and <br/>
add-ons out there. With over 2000 boxes that I've found in that one <br/>
state alone, you can imagine that there are just not that many boxes <br/>
left in CT for me to go looking for, but they do miraculously keep <br/>
coming out! I'd just gone back for yet another jaunt through <br/>
Brooksvale Park near the Sleeping Giant, and was about to stamp <br/>
into "Secret Agent Man", when suddenly Pete's little "Mr. Sunshine" <br/>
stamp slipped out of my fingers. No problem, I thought - our stamps <br/>
are so tiny that's happened lots of times before, and I saw right <br/>
where it rolled into the stone wall. So I finished signing in, then <br/>
went to retrieve the stamp, but it turned out there was a hole right <br/>
under that particular spot in the wall that went way down! (Now what <br/>
were the chances of that!?!) Poking, prodding, reaching, and trying <br/>
to budge any ot the surrounding rocks were all to no avail, so what <br/>
could I do? I just sat there in the woods and cried! It felt like <br/>
losing your wedding ring down the sink or something - our little <br/>
symbol of 3 years of happy letterboxing together down the tubes! <br/>
Fortunately, first thing the following weekend, Pete went back to <br/>
Brooksvale with me and a giant crowbar. With one quick, well-aimed <br/>
pry, he had "Mr. Sunshine" shining back up the sky! Hurray - a happy <br/>
ending for that story!<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I was going around letterboxing closer to home, doing some <br/>
of the bigger loops in MA and RI, when what should befall me but an <br/>
even stranger adventure - attack by giant bird! No kidding, it was <br/>
straight out of Hitchcock! I was about 1/2 way through the 8-mile <br/>
loop north of Beach Pond on the RI/CT border where Mike and <br/>
Christine's delightful "12 Animals of Chinese Mythology #2" series <br/>
is, and was just finishing up signing in (still stampless) at <br/>
the "Monkey", when I felt a swoosh go by right over my head. I didn't <br/>
think much of it, as there are plenty of hawks and owls in this part <br/>
of Pachaug Forest, but then just as I was walking away from the <br/>
letterbox site, I heard a high-pitched scream and got knocked down <br/>
flat to the ground by a heavy blow to the back of my head! Just to <br/>
give some idea of the impact, my hat which was attached by its <br/>
chinstrap, got thrown off my head some 25 feet forward to the right, <br/>
and my logbook, which was in my left hand, went flying a dozen or so <br/>
feet out in the other direction! I looked up from the ground to see <br/>
one of the biggest birds I've ever seen - more like an eagle than a <br/>
turkey vulture, although Laurette thinks it may have been an osprey, <br/>
since she once got "dive-bombed" by one near a nesting site, too! <br/>
Anyway, over the years I've been the victim of quite a few vicious <br/>
attacks, both emotional and physical, by humans (including a brutal <br/>
attack by a woman who started screaming and pulling my hair in a <br/>
jealous rage over Pete just 2 years ago today!), but never did I <br/>
expect to get attacked by a bird! Since my pastor keeps telling me I <br/>
need to protect myself from abusive situations and learn to defend <br/>
myself effectively if necessary, I quickly gathered up my belongings <br/>
and a big stick - if that bird were going to come back at me, I was <br/>
going to be prepared to take a swing and not become some kind of <br/>
bizarre statistic: "Woman Killed by Bird"! Fortunately, I was able to <br/>
get away mostly just rather shaken, so it certainly seems easier to <br/>
understand the bird's actions as a natural instinct to protect its <br/>
offspring, rather than the relentless, demented need to hurt or harm <br/>
seen in some humans! However, I would still recommend taking a big <br/>
stick for anyone going through this area, just in case!<br/>
<br/>
So, shortly after that, with only a slight headache from the <br/>
concussion, I got to do my "Happy Hunter Dance" (just a little hint <br/>
for those still working on my CIA code name!) at my 2000th box in one <br/>
year and my PFX 5000 all in one fell swoop! My F-count at that box <br/>
was 4393, and when I compared that to when I reached 2393, it just <br/>
happened to be at "Time Travels" in MA exactly one year earlier! So, <br/>
it's been quite a year - and to think I hadn't even been trying to <br/>
just accumulate "numbers" (as only some people with more jealousy <br/>
than understanding could possibly think!:-) I had, in fact, spent <br/>
several months doing trail work, theater productions, etc. with <br/>
hardly any letterboxing at all! And, as anyone who has boxed with us <br/>
can attest, we're pretty laid back when we letterbox and just seem to <br/>
go with the flow ("rapid" perhaps sometimes, but never "rabid"!;-) At <br/>
any rate, the "numbers" come for us only as a natural outgrowth of <br/>
our love for the hobby, so I certainly hope no one will begrudge us <br/>
the simple pleasure we sometimes take in adding up and recounting our <br/>
various adventures! Thanks to all who make it possible!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S.New personal goals? Well, P100 and F5000 in a few months, I hope! <br/>
Then hopefully some more trail work trips out west, but this year <br/>
I'll have to try to make it back for Chuck's Monster Bash on Oct. <br/>
2nd - that promises to be  quite the event of the season, and we'll <br/>
be looking forward to seeing a lot of you letterboxers there!<br/>

<br/>
Congratulations and thanks for sharing your stories.<br/>
<br/>
I can attest to the fact that Wanda is into letterboxing for more <br/>
than the numbers.  On one particular ocassion she took me to <br/>
Mansfield, CT and accompanied me to 28 boxes that were all revisits <br/>
for her.  We spent about 5 hours on the trails, had lunch at the <br/>
infamous cliff that Chuck went over and had a great time.  She has <br/>
offered me her companionship and friendship on the trail many times.  <br/>
<br/>
I think you should be proud of your letterboxing achievements.<br/>
