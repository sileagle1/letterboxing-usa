&gt; retired boxed could have some sort of flag or other<br/>
&gt; marker on the list so that you could tell at a glance,<br/>
&gt; without having to click on and read the clues to find<br/>
&gt; out that the box is gone.  <br/>
<br/>
That's a possible enhancement, but it relies on the owner <br/>
of the box to set the "retired" status. Sometimes placers <br/>
just put "(RETIRED)" in the title of their retired <br/>
letterboxes to let people know.<br/>
