River Walk<br/>
<br/>
A single, easy letterbox in a spectacular setting at the mouth of the<br/>
Connecticut River overlooking the Great Island Salt Marshes and Long Island<br/>
Sound. Less than one half mile of level walking. Bring binoculars, your<br/>
Peterson Guide to the Birds (this was Roger Tory Peterson's adopted home)<br/>
and wear warm clothes on windy days!<br/>
<br/>
On I-95 in Lyme, CT, take exit 70 (and if southbound, follow the 156 signs<br/>
past a shopping center and turn left to pass back under the freeway), and<br/>
follow CT Rte. 156 East 0.3 miles. Turn right onto Ferry Rd and follow it to<br/>
the end, parking at the DEP Headquarters lot. Walk through the picnic area<br/>
and past the gazebo to find the shore side boardwalk.<br/>
<br/>
Follow this magnificent boardwalk out along the river and under the rail<br/>
road bridge, watching the water, boats, birds, and bluefish. Walk all the<br/>
way out to the end, where an elevated platform overlooks the estuary. On the<br/>
lower level, look up in the girders overhead in the northeast corner to find<br/>
the River Walk Letterbox.<br/>
