The city of Philadelphia has more park land within its borders than any<br/>
other city in the world. One of its well known treasures is the<br/>
Wissahickon Park This huge park stretches for miles from the confluence<br/>
of the Wissahickon Creek with the Schulykill River at its southern end<br/>
to the northwest border of the city. The park gets over a million<br/>
visitors a year, many of whom find it a spiritual respite from the<br/>
stress of urban living. The Wissahickon is a fine place to visit during<br/>
all seasons and in any weather.<br/>
<br/>
The following is the first in a series of boxes to be placed in the<br/>
park.<br/>
