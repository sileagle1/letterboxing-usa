The second is a physical box place:<br/>
<br/>
NAME: MOUNT SI TRAILS<br/>
Placed by: eliza b/moderngypsy<br/>
date: 6-9-02<br/>
Location: MT. SI<br/>
Closest City:  North Bend, WA (just outside of Seattle on I-90)<br/>
County:  King.<br/>
<br/>
Mount Si is one of the easier, more hospitable of the Northern Cascades <br/>
to climb.  If you're really motivated, getting to the Haystack at the <br/>
top is only about four miles...granted, it's four miles of some trails <br/>
that seem to be darn near vertical...but it's got some of the most <br/>
incredible views to be found.  The summit is another two miles from the <br/>
haystack, but it's advisable to go that far only with some <br/>
mountaineering experience under your belt.<br/>
<br/>
To get to Mt. Si from Seattle:  Take the i-90 East, through Issiquah to <br/>
exit #31 (approximately an hour from downtown).  Follow the Mt. Si Road <br/>
through town to where you cross the river, and veer right.  In about 2 <br/>
1/2 miles, there will be a mostly hidden 175-car parking lot on your <br/>
right.  Turn in, park, and find the trailhead.  (Don't be fooled by the <br/>
small, 30-car lot only a mile from the bridge -- it's a new trail and <br/>
is, for our purposes, the wrong one.)<br/>
<br/>
The trailhead is straight ahead from the water pump (to clean your shoes <br/>
after descent -- the trails are very muddy right now.), and has a sign <br/>
closing it to foot traffic only.  After a few hundred yards, on your <br/>
right is a sign that marks the Mount Si Trail, 4 mi.  Turn, and follow <br/>
the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Keep following the trail for close to two miles and nearly two thousand <br/>
feet gained, past a gorgeous rocky overlook and a place to sit and rest. <br/>
  At the fork where you can follow either the Mt. Si Trail or the Creek, <br/>
continue on the Si trail.<br/>
<br/>
Once through the Snag Flats, an interpretive center/wooden walkway will <br/>
appear as the path veers slightly to the left.  Stop at the first <br/>
informational sign and read about the great fire of 1910, then turn <br/>
slightly to your left.  There will be three large, cut logs just behind <br/>
the sign, parallel to the path.  One is standoffish and is apart from <br/>
the others, and two of them are touching.<br/>
<br/>
Behind these two, in the joint where the two "overlap", next to a small <br/>
sapling and a white rock, under some bark -- the letterbox waits.<br/>
<br/>
Two more boxes in the Si series are coming soon.<br/>
