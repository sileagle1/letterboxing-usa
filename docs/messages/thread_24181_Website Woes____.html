that if one site goes down, others can still get my clues.<br/>

Unfortuntely, not everyone puts clues on both sites.......  I guess <br/>
I will only be going for Bandaid and J Peter's boxes tomorrow.....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What I do to avoid possible website woes that might come up at the last<br/>
minute is to cute &amp; paste the clues into a word document and save them on my<br/>
own computer as soon as I see them get posted on LbNA or on someone's<br/>
private website, even tho it may be a looong time before I have a chance to<br/>
search for the box, if at all.  Or sometimes I'll just quick print the clues<br/>
out right off the website.<br/>
<br/>
That way, if I decide at the last minute that I have some free time or some<br/>
extra gas in the van, I bring the clues up on the LbNA site again to compare<br/>
notes and make sure there were no changes to the clues.  But if the website<br/>
is down for some reason or the internet is working too slow for my taste and<br/>
I'm getting frustrated with it, I can just set out with the clues I already<br/>
either have saved on my computer or saved in print.  I think once I went<br/>
after a box whose clues had been changed and a private website was down and<br/>
I couldn't compare notes so I wasn't able to find the box that time.<br/>
<br/>
But in general, it saves me the disappointment of being able to go search at<br/>
the last minute but having no clues to search with.<br/>
<br/>
It also sometimes means I can find boxes whose placers are no longer in<br/>
boxing and who have removed clues from websites but who haven't yet gotten<br/>
around to removing the boxes from the wild.  More than a couple of times<br/>
I've gone after a box "just to see" if it's still out there after the placer<br/>
said they'd removed it, and yep, it was sitting right where the clues I had<br/>
said it would be.  :-)  That was kinda fun.<br/>
