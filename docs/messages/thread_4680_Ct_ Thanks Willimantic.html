out and stamped in to the boxes. You wouldn't believe how excited <br/>
they were to see how far folks came to visit their box. They each <br/>
carved theri own stamp today and visited Falling leaves Letterbox. <br/>
You will be seeing Spiderwoman, 007, Chrysalis, Scottie , Easter <br/>
Bunny, Sharky M.O. , Ratboy, and one more I can't remeber tonight out <br/>
there on the trail. Welcome to letterboxing kids. have Fun and Be <br/>
safe.Leader of the pack<br/>
<br/>
I'll also note that I visited the Fall of the Pixies a most excellent <br/>
adventure. I took along Larry Boy Dino Boy Mma Duck Baby, and Gramma <br/>
Gramma to make it a wonderful day. We also went to Chuck's Nipmuck <br/>
and natchaug which was a great spot.  Thanks for planting them and <br/>
making our day. Thanks Boys for a great walk in the woods.   L-O-T-P<br/>
