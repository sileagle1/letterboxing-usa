Traveling Circus, hunted out and found the Coquille River Lighthouse <br/>
letterbox. Sadly to say we did not run into the two other letterboxers who <br/>
were there earlier that day, 9/5 (John and Ginger from MA). Our compliments <br/>
to the carver (Ryan). The logbook is fun to read because most of the box's <br/>
discoverers were from out of state, for many of the finders it was also a <br/>
first find. Thank you for the enjoyable search.<br/>
