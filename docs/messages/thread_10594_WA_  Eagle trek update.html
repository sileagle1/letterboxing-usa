action along the Skagit River.  Also found some letterboxes along <br/>
the way.  Am unable to contact one of the letterbox owners so I'll <br/>
post the status of the boxes online to help with your 'box <br/>
maintenance'.<br/>

Found 'Candle in the Wind' in excellent shape with a couple of <br/>
visitors.  Incredible Thuja Plicata!!!  Wow!  Now we know what it <br/>
is...  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Placed 'Bald Eagle' near the river.  Clues will be posted soon...<br/>

Found 'Mukilteo' in excellent shape with a couple of very recent <br/>
visitors--us today and Orion on 31 Jan.  What a glorious location <br/>
and such a fun little park for the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Found 'Anniversary' in excellent shape with an AWESOME view of the <br/>
Sound and the Olympics.  Can't believe we were the first visitors to <br/>
this box as it's been on the market for 7 weeks now!  I highly <br/>
recommend this one to others (as do we recommend the other 2 on this <br/>
list)--bring a nice picnic lunch and enjoy the incredible views!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for some great letterboxes in this area.  It was nice <br/>
to visit these letterboxes and very cathartic for us, too, during <br/>
this trying time in our nation's history.  Saw a few Bald Eagles <br/>
along the way, too!  Nothing like witnessing our nation's symbol of <br/>
freedom in action!!!<br/>

PS  Noticed that Burlington has a Krispy Kreme for those who are <br/>
interested! Who knew? ;)<br/>
