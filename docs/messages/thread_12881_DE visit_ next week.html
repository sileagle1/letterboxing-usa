Tuesday and leaving Friday.  As it is about an eight-hour drive from <br/>
New England, our boxing prospects will be pretty much limited to <br/>
Wednesday and Thursday.  We hope to get several boxes along the south <br/>
coast, and if we could hook up with some area boxers, that would be <br/>
so much the better.<br/>
<br/>
So if there are any local boxers available on those days who would <br/>
like to meet and exchange, please contact me offlist at cscm @ <br/>
toast . net.  WE'll see if we can set somehting up.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
