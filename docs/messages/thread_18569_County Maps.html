and click on the map to visit each state.  There's a printable map by <br/>
county for all of them.<br/>

I have a folder I keep printed copies of the maps in.  When I print a <br/>
new one, I use a highlight to mark each state that has clues listed <br/>
off the database.  When I return from each trip I just slide the <br/>
printout back in the folder along with printed clues from that state <br/>
for boxes I haven't found yet.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds more organized than I actually am (laughing) but it's really <br/>
helped me get a handle on where stuff is as I've gotten more into the <br/>
hobby.  And, the maps are all free.  Free is GOOD.  :-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the suggestion, Greycrazy;  I'd been wondering where to <br/>
find that info on counties in each state.  I have road maps of every <br/>
state, but sometimes it's difficult to see the county names and <br/>
outlines.<br/>
Now I have printed out quite a few states and started a folder of my <br/>
own.  I plan to shade or check the counties that have LBs as a first <br/>
step in planning an auto trip.  But I still wish the LbNA website had <br/>
the information up-to-date.<br/>
Users of the government census website will want to know that the <br/>
link to click on is at the very top, and that attention should be <br/>
given to choosing portrait or landscape and to the scaled-down <br/>
versions offered to get the maps on an 8 x 11 sheet.<br/>

 - Good call on the census site.  That's what I use when people tell me that<br/>
'xxx county has a box in it'.<br/>
<br/>
 - I _believe_ I've filled in all the counties that people have sent me.  Of<br/>
course, I'm human, and your email may be languishing in my box, months ago.<br/>
Remind me.<br/>
<br/>
 - Images can be locally cached, so I might have made the change but your<br/>
browser isn't showing you the latest copy of the image.  In IE, force it with<br/>
<shift>-<refresh> and it'll go get everything anew.<br/>
<br/>
As always, if you have new counties, you have to tell me to fill 'em in.<br/>
