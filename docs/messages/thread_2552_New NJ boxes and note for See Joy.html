There are a pair at Rutgers Gardens in New Brunswick, Middlesex County, at:  www.geocities.com/martianmaggot_k9/ruboxes/gardens.html<br/>
Also, could you update the Nj pages for two things.  The Cheesequake box is in Matawan, Monmouth County.  And there are two boxes under Somewhere in NJ.  Thanks!<br/>
And a note for See Joy, I have found the Waterfall Walk box, and that was last summer.<br/>
