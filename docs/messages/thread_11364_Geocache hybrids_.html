&gt; others felt about the hybrid concept.<br/>
<br/>
There are some very vocal opponents to hybrids.  They think the stuff <br/>
in a geocache is junk.  They don't like how large geocaches are.  And <br/>
there have been issues with the stamp missing due to geocachers <br/>
thinking it was an object available for exchanging.  For the most <br/>
part, geocachers and letterboxers do not mix.  Heaven forbid if <br/>
there's ever an event where both geocachers and letterboxers are <br/>
invited.  The national guard might need to be called to quell the <br/>
ensuing riots!<br/>
<br/>
There are exceptions of course, and a few people actually enjoy both <br/>
activities and like hybrids.  But you NEVER hear anyone complaining <br/>
that there aren't enough hybrids!  Consequently, as the path of least <br/>
resistance, I'd recommend not hiding hybrids.  Everyone is happy.<br/>
<br/>
There are two reasons hybrid hiders seem to focus on for hiding <br/>
hybrids: 1) Their letterboxes aren't getting much action so they want <br/>
to draw in more people by making it a geocache too, or 2) they're <br/>
trying to "convert" geocachers into letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
For point #1, if all you really want are visitors to write notes in <br/>
the logbook saying how wonderful the box is, just hide a geocache.  <br/>
They probably outnumber letterboxers a hundred to one and you'll get <br/>
plenty of action that way.<br/>
<br/>
For point #2, I have yet to hear of anyone truely "switching sides".  <br/>
I have a theory about that if you're really interested.  (If not, <br/>
skip the rest of this paragraph!)  When people start letterboxing or <br/>
geocaching, they start to make friends.  They start to swap war <br/>
stories of such-and-such box or such-and-such person.  They become <br/>
used to that hobby's website and layout.  Then, one day, they learn <br/>
about this "other" (but related) hobby and get curious.  Maybe they <br/>
even look for a box by the "other side".  But they don't know <br/>
anyone.  They have no connections.  They're in unfamiliar territory, <br/>
and ultimately they "go back" to their comfort zone.  <br/>
<br/>
But what if you're really dieing to create a hybrid--you love <br/>
letterboxing and don't want to give THAT up, but you still want lots <br/>
of visitors and/or to convince geocachers to hunt down letterboxes.  <br/>
You can STILL DO THAT without creating a hybrid!  Yes, that's right!  <br/>
The best of both worlds!<br/>
<br/>
Usually I charge $10/person for this advice, but because I like you <br/>
folks, I'll tell you my secret for free.  That's right, folks, FREE!  <br/>
No strings attached!  =)<br/>
<br/>
How do you get the best of both worlds?  Simple: When you go to hide <br/>
a letterbox, put a geocache in a nearby place.  Perhaps behind the <br/>
next tree.  Or under a different rock.  Somewhere nearby.  Then, when <br/>
you go to check up on your letterbox and see nobody has visited it, <br/>
you can walk ten feet to the geocache and see the dozens of visitors <br/>
saying how wonderful your geocache is!<br/>
<br/>
And if you want to try to "convert" a geocacher (although I'm <br/>
absolutely convinced it's a losing battle), include the clue for the <br/>
letterbox in your geocache!  Those that might be interested can then <br/>
look for the letterbox, and those who aren't won't.  The best of both <br/>
worlds!<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, if you want to try to "convert" a letterboxer into a <br/>
geocacher, you can include the GPS coordinates for your geocache in <br/>
your letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, keeping the two concepts seperate by putting them in two <br/>
different boxes--even if they're within peeing distance of each other-<br/>

But I now see there are two reasons not to:<br/>
<br/>
1) Would the list ever agree on the answer?<br/>
<br/>
2) Ryan's posts (and he always responds to this Q) are always <br/>
entertaining.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
FWIW on Ryan's conversion theory: I found out about both at roughly <br/>
the same time and was interested in both. Being w/o a GPS I never <br/>
looked for a geocache. Now I have no particular desire to find one. <br/>
Not sure exactly why. Probably mostly because the geocache website <br/>
is partly fee only. And I still don't have a GPS. :)<br/>
<br/>
In any case I think Ryan is right, if letterboxers aren't visiting <br/>
your boxes, they aren't going to suddenly swarm to your hybrids. The <br/>
hybrids may get more visitors but they will be mostly geocachers.<br/>

I letterboxed for about one month and got my 100<br/>
finds. I then switched over to geocaching, but without<br/>
using GPS. I treat it like letterboxing, where the<br/>
main clue is the coordinates.<br/>
<br/>
I had turned a certain relative of mine on to<br/>
letterboxing, and she has stayed with it. Not too long<br/>
ago, we combined to do a hybrid. I have been quite<br/>
happy with the results. You can check the details<br/>

You know, there's not actually a rule saying that letterboxing clues <br/>
can't use GPS coordinates.  Kind of a geocache without the junk!  =)  <br/>
Some letterboxers without a GPS might be disappointed not having the <br/>
tools necessary to find it, but then not every letterbox is for <br/>
everyone.  Just ask anyone who has cursed my name while hiking up <br/>
some large mountain to get a box of mine.  ;o)<br/>

I'd be thrilled to death if we could convince geocachers to just give <br/>
up the junk and switch to stamps.  I'd become a geocacher in no time <br/>

<div>I do both geocaching and letterboxing.  I do 
hunt for geocaches but I find letterboxes more rewarding. With geocaching, 
there is the immediate thrill of finding the box but usually the content are no 
big deal.  With a letterbox, there is the enjoyment and mystery of the 
stamp.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I believe that more people geocache because it is 
far easier to do for a couple of reasons:</div>
<div>1) The clues are a lot easier (in most 
cases).  You are given pretty much the exact spot the cache is.  Up to 
date GPS receivers can get you with in 20' in most cases.</div>
<div>2) There is not a lot of preparation 
involved.  You just raid your kids Happy Meal toy collection and head out 
for the cache.  Letterboxing requires a creative investment in terms of a 
personal stamp.  Placing a cache is easier as well.  Throw some 
junk in a box and put it out there.  Again, letterboxing requires more 
creativity in creating the stamp and writing clues that will get someone to find 
your box.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I do like Ryan's idea of putting letterbox clues in 
a geocache and GPS coords. in a letterbox.</div>

  First of all, Thanks to Sandi Beach Team for the Comments :O) They are <br/>
always welcome. Also, We will meet you guy's at the Hat Trick Cache<br/>
at 8:30 am Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
  Just a small comment about Hybrids.  Yes they can work. Is it easy<br/>
to come up with one? About as easy as the first Stamp you carved, Not<br/>
the 30th one that looks great, BUT that first stamp you made.  Augh!!!<br/>
<br/>
  Sith Impossible has 33 Logs by Geocachers and 11 Logs by Letterboxers, 11 <br/>
Logs in the Cincinnati, Ohio area is alot of logs<br/>
for a Letterbox.  (3 to 1)<br/>
<br/>
  What kills the Letterboxes is the fact that you can not log them<br/>
like you do the Geocaches. I started out Letterboxing and then<br/>
took up Geocaching.  I love to do both,  I also know a few others who do <br/>
both, BUT I do have to say, It's real nice to log a cache.<br/>
<br/>
  Our letterboxes (150+) we have hidden, I could not tell you just<br/>
how many of them are still their. We have 42 Geocaches and we get a<br/>
message as soon as someone logs they can't find it. Before I go and<br/>
get a Geocache, I can read the log and see if the last few people<br/>
had trouble finding it or not, Letterboxing, Pot Luck, May it is their, <br/>
Maybe it's not.<br/>
<br/>
  Most of our letterboxes have GPS Waypoints, That way you can do them<br/>
any way you wish.  (Clues or Waypoint)<br/>
<br/>
  Also :O)  I place my Hitch Hikers in Geocaches, And they all have seem<br/>
(But 1) have found their way into Letterboxes. Placed 15 so far.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [LbNA] Re: Geocache hybrids?<br/>
&gt;Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2003 05:59:51 -0000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I noticed my letterboxes are only getting a small fraction of<br/>
&gt; &gt; visitors that nearby geocaches are getting.  I was wondering how<br/>
&gt; &gt; others felt about the hybrid concept.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are some very vocal opponents to hybrids.  They think the stuff<br/>
&gt;in a geocache is junk.  They don't like how large geocaches are.  And<br/>
&gt;there have been issues with the stamp missing due to geocachers<br/>
&gt;thinking it was an object available for exchanging.  For the most<br/>
&gt;part, geocachers and letterboxers do not mix.  Heaven forbid if<br/>
&gt;there's ever an event where both geocachers and letterboxers are<br/>
&gt;invited.  The national guard might need to be called to quell the<br/>
&gt;ensuing riots!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are exceptions of course, and a few people actually enjoy both<br/>
&gt;activities and like hybrids.  But you NEVER hear anyone complaining<br/>
&gt;that there aren't enough hybrids!  Consequently, as the path of least<br/>
&gt;resistance, I'd recommend not hiding hybrids.  Everyone is happy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are two reasons hybrid hiders seem to focus on for hiding<br/>
&gt;hybrids: 1) Their letterboxes aren't getting much action so they want<br/>
&gt;to draw in more people by making it a geocache too, or 2) they're<br/>
&gt;trying to "convert" geocachers into letterboxers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For point #1, if all you really want are visitors to write notes in<br/>
&gt;the logbook saying how wonderful the box is, just hide a geocache.<br/>
&gt;They probably outnumber letterboxers a hundred to one and you'll get<br/>
&gt;plenty of action that way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For point #2, I have yet to hear of anyone truely "switching sides".<br/>
&gt;I have a theory about that if you're really interested.  (If not,<br/>
&gt;skip the rest of this paragraph!)  When people start letterboxing or<br/>
&gt;geocaching, they start to make friends.  They start to swap war<br/>
&gt;stories of such-and-such box or such-and-such person.  They become<br/>
&gt;used to that hobby's website and layout.  Then, one day, they learn<br/>
&gt;about this "other" (but related) hobby and get curious.  Maybe they<br/>
&gt;even look for a box by the "other side".  But they don't know<br/>
&gt;anyone.  They have no connections.  They're in unfamiliar territory,<br/>
&gt;and ultimately they "go back" to their comfort zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But what if you're really dieing to create a hybrid--you love<br/>
&gt;letterboxing and don't want to give THAT up, but you still want lots<br/>
&gt;of visitors and/or to convince geocachers to hunt down letterboxes.<br/>
&gt;You can STILL DO THAT without creating a hybrid!  Yes, that's right!<br/>
&gt;The best of both worlds!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Usually I charge $10/person for this advice, but because I like you<br/>
&gt;folks, I'll tell you my secret for free.  That's right, folks, FREE!<br/>
&gt;No strings attached!  =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How do you get the best of both worlds?  Simple: When you go to hide<br/>
&gt;a letterbox, put a geocache in a nearby place.  Perhaps behind the<br/>
&gt;next tree.  Or under a different rock.  Somewhere nearby.  Then, when<br/>
&gt;you go to check up on your letterbox and see nobody has visited it,<br/>
&gt;you can walk ten feet to the geocache and see the dozens of visitors<br/>
&gt;saying how wonderful your geocache is!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And if you want to try to "convert" a geocacher (although I'm<br/>
&gt;absolutely convinced it's a losing battle), include the clue for the<br/>
&gt;letterbox in your geocache!  Those that might be interested can then<br/>
&gt;look for the letterbox, and those who aren't won't.  The best of both<br/>
&gt;worlds!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Likewise, if you want to try to "convert" a letterboxer into a<br/>
&gt;geocacher, you can include the GPS coordinates for your geocache in<br/>
&gt;your letterbox.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In any case, keeping the two concepts seperate by putting them in two<br/>
&gt;different boxes--even if they're within peeing distance of each other-<br/>
&gt;-keeps everyone happy and still accomplishes all your goals.  Case<br/>
&gt;closed.  =)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I enjoy both letterboxing and geocaching.  They both have advantages <br/>
and disadvantanges.  I think its cool to combine the two sometimes, <br/>
mix things up a bit and expose people to new things.<br/>
<br/>
Geocaching is not any "junkier" than letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I have had the opportunity to discover some truly beautiful locations <br/>
in caching just as in boxing.  You also are sometimes get a lucky <br/>
bonus of finding unique and interesting objects in the caches.  Some <br/>
people do drop in "useless" things, but what's useless to one may be <br/>
useful to another!<br/>
<br/>
I personally spend a lot of time making "signature" clay coins to <br/>
leave in geocaches, among store-bought things that I find <br/>
interesting.  I wouldn't call that junk, and I have found quite a few <br/>
objects from caches that I keep and enjoy just like the stamped <br/>
images I get from boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Do both caching and boxing, together or seperately, but get out and <br/>
have fun!! Someone will come visit your stash and enjoy it, no matter <br/>
what it is.<br/>

hi jim<br/>
<br/>
i would say to go for it.....i learned about letterboxing and <br/>
geocaching at the same time....<br/>
<br/>
i do NOT have a GPS unit so i like to read the "cheat codes" on the <br/>
geocaches to find them...and if need be email the hider and ask for <br/>
another cheat...<br/>
<br/>
the only letterbox listed in my town , san antonio, is downtown by <br/>
the alamo..i dont like to drive downtown too often..whereas there are <br/>
tons of geocaches near where i live...some just have the coordinates <br/>
but i like the ones that give hints to find them...those i look <br/>
for..they have hints and are near my house...<br/>
<br/>
i have picked me out a stamp to use for the letterboxing/geocaching <br/>
but so far have forgotten it when i find it...so i just sign in on <br/>
the logbook...<br/>
<br/>
i agree with the other person ??? who wrote it would be nice to log <br/>
their letterbox finds like the geocache page has...love to read <br/>
others experiences...<br/>
<br/>
i have just found my 2nd geocache........hope to find more...<br/>
<br/>
i check the letterbox and geocache webpages to see if any are hidden <br/>
in any areas that i visit also....<br/>

<br/>
Some people do keep on their own websites threads for each of their <br/>
letterboxes where anyone can talk about the letterbox be it finding <br/>
them or just to say they loved the stamp or whatever the case may <br/>
be.  It's not very common, though.<br/>
<br/>
My clues are posted on Geocities which does allow a logbook, but only <br/>
allows one for the entire website.  So all the posts to it aren't <br/>
seperated by subject or letterbox, but some people occasionally post <br/>
finds and such to the list.<br/>
<br/>
And a lot of people post their experiences right here on this board.  <br/>
Which, again, isn't sorted by letterbox or subject, but it's better <br/>
than nothing!  =)<br/>

Some of the geocaches have at geocaching.com have hints that can give directions to where to find a cache.  If you use the Mapquest link, you can get into the general area and then use the hints to find the cache.<br/>
<br/>
This is an example of a hint for a cache.  The Mapquest link show the coordinates to be in a recreation area.  Using the  aerial photo option in Mapquest (if available in your area), you can see a trail running through the area. The hint reads: "A gap in the bridge, look high."  Walking down the trail takes you under a highway bridge. Looking in the expansion joints under the bridge will reward you with the geocache.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you have a GPS, on average, you can only get accuracy with a 20' radius area so you will have a 40' circle to search.  There is a cache I can't find, despite being at the coordinates.  The hint says it is under a plant of which there must be 40 or 50 within the circle of accuracy.<br/>

  How do you find the geocaches without a GPS? I tried that one time and<br/>
  am sure I was within 100 yards of it, but had no idea whether to look<br/>
  under a rock or under a log or under a bridge.... I'm serious.. I'd<br/>
  really like to know how to do it so I can find them without spending<br/>
  those big bucks for a GPS that is useless to me for anything else!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Speaking from experience...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I letterboxed for about one month and got my 100<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; finds. I then switched over to geocaching, but without<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; using GPS. I treat it like letterboxing, where the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; main clue is the coordinates.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I had turned a certain relative of mine on to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing, and she has stayed with it. Not too long<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ago, we combined to do a hybrid. I have been quite<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; happy with the results. You can check the details<br/>
