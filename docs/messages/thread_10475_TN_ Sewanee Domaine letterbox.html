Sewanee Domaine letterbox hidden near The University of the South in <br/>
central Tennessee.  It is, by far, the most difficult and cryptic of <br/>
any box we've taken a stab at.<br/>
     After a couple of hours of hunting, we had to abandon our search <br/>
to head back home.  On the other hand, we loved exploring the <br/>
breathtakingly beautiful campus, and encourage anyone in the area <br/>
with the time to make the trek.<br/>
     Has anyone been able to find this box?  On the road back to <br/>
Atlanta we read through the rest of the clue and found there's some <br/>
cryptography to be done.  In addition, we're not exactly sure what it <br/>
is we'll be doing with all the years we've been writing down.  Any <br/>
nudges in the right direction would be greatly appreciated!<br/>
