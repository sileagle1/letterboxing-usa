<br/>
Baxter Woods Series is doing well - despite having to move one of the<br/>
boxes. This is noted in the log. This series might be difficult in the<br/>
winter - specifically Box #2 as it is underneath a rock on the ground<br/>
which is either mostly covered with leaves and/or snow this time of<br/>
year. I have noted the clue to reflect this information as well.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this was stated a while back - but I will post again that the<br/>
FORT ALLEN PARK letterbox has been REMOVED FOR WINTER. The stamp for<br/>
Fort Allen Park is also being mounted and will be taken care of during<br/>
the long winter in Maine. The spot was too exposed for an over-winter.<br/>
<br/>
This and many other updates are found directly on the clues at all<br/>
times. Please see our web page for more info:<br/>

Happy New Year All!<br/>
