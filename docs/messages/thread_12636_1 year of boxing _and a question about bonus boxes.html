<br/>
What does everyone think about placing bonus clues to another box out of another person's letterbox - should one ask permission first?<br/>
<br/>
The Hare is currently on Military Orders in another area of the country (hi honey!) and I've been a lazy wife and haven't carved the stamp for the box yet.  I'm keeping the "Will you Marry Me" stamp that was in it when I found it the first time 'round. ;-)<br/>

<br/>
&gt;And is there now a letterbox there or near with an engagement ring <br/>
&gt;stamp?!<br/>

&gt;&gt; I wanted to say a quick word of appreciation for everyone who has <br/>
&gt;made letterboxing such a wonderful addition to my life.  <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Today is my (and my husband's) 1-year anniversary of <br/>
&gt;letterboxing.  The first boxes we found were planted by Two Grey <br/>
&gt;Squirrels in Greenbelt Park, Maryland - Thanks Squirrel!  You got us <br/>
&gt;hooked :-)<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; My introduction was by a friend who saw an article on letterboxing <br/>
&gt;and thought that it was something that I might enjoy.  She was <br/>
&gt;right! - Thanks Gigi.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Thanks to the webmasters for all of their hard work and also to <br/>
&gt;every one of you who participates on this list, because even during <br/>
&gt;the winter I have enjoyed reading about your adventures and am <br/>
&gt;always excited to hear about all the new boxes that are out there.  <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; After 1 year, I am at  F53 P3 HH1 PP1.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; (The PP is for Proposal - the Hare faked an email that looked like <br/>
&gt;a post to this list with a letterbox near our home.  We went out to <br/>
&gt;look for it together and while I was eagerly opening the rubbermaid <br/>
&gt;box he went down to one knee.  What a great guy, and a very romantic <br/>
&gt;proposal.  We were married earlier this year.)   <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Keep those adventures coming :-)<br/>
