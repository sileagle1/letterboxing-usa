I have just completed the first stage of the process at this end, which is to send the stamps away to be registered with the Dartmoor Letterboxes 100 Club.  This will mean that each stamp will have its own unique registration number and will appear in the 100 club catalogue of letterboxes and clues.  <br/>
I will keep you all posted on their progress and where upon the moor they are placed, but please bear with me as there are 15 of them and its a big moor and i'll be in my own ! lol<br/>

Gwen and I have been wondering how some folks are counting <br/>
their "gift stamps" used in the exchange? We don't emphasize our <br/>
F,P,X,or C count other than listing in our personal logs, but figure <br/>
we should count these as something. Maybe G 2 ? We didn't plant them <br/>
nor found them ,at least not yet.<br/>

I was wondering the same thing and was just going to think of it as<br/>
one placed.  I figured that I made one, and when we get Andy's and I<br/>
can plant his, then in a convoluted way it will be a plant.<br/>

Brilliant!  I didn't realize the prestige involved when I signed up <br/>
for this project.  Wow, to have my humble little stamp officially <br/>
*registered* with the Dartmoor Letterboxes 100 Club *and* to be <br/>
published in the catalogue of letterboxes and clues!<br/>
