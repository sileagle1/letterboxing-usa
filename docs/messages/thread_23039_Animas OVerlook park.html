That road isn't plowed, so it only opens after spring melt-off. We can <br/>
be dry in town but still have large drifts further up that keep it <br/>
closed. Usually March is a bit early for the melt above Durango, but <br/>
this year has been very dry so far.<br/>
<br/>
That's a long weay of saying, "I don't know".<br/>
<br/>
All  5 of those boxes were alive and well as of November.<br/>

I'll give it a shot.<br/>

What about the other boxes on 550 heading towards Durango Mountain<br/>

Yes! Both of the new letterboxes on the Haflin Creek trail are <br/>
highly recommended and should be mostly snow-free in March. I'm sure <br/>
