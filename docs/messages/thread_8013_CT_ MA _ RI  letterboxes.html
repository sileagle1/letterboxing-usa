checked on Box 1 in Coventry (the missing one noted) on Wednesday the 25 (around 
1pm) and it was definitely there at that time. When were you there? I will 
double check on it over the weekend. Glad you had a great trip!! I haven't 
been to Point Judith but can't wait to get it especially now that I hear your 
praise!!!!!</span></div>

<br/>We came in from the northwest and understood the site to be on "our" side of the bridge on the opposite side of the street. (That is, the other side of the bridge from the "meadow".) There was a place there which looked to be a turnout once but there was a large pile of dirt newly laid there. Although we looked on both sides of the bridge, we couldn't find the tree where the letterbox was. How far off were we?

You were HOT very Hot but thats the way some boxes are their very <br/>
simplicity makes them an illusion on our best days and why we are <br/>
always so pleased when we actually find them. Was there  at #1 <br/>
yesterday and all well.  <br/>
   Glad you found KJ's Best and enjoyed your trip to the area. <br/>
