County on December 29, 2002 by Amanda Briles, The Paisley Orca.<br/>
<br/>
In Portland, park near SE 4th and Ivon.  It's maybe 1/4 to 1/2 mile<br/>
southeast of OMSI.  This is where the Willamette segment of the<br/>
Springwater Corridor begins.  <br/>
<br/>
Either on bike or foot (no motor vehicles allowed) head South on the<br/>
Springwater Corridor Willamette segment paved path.  Go past a bench and<br/>
picnic area.  Go beyond the mounded area with the bench and art work.<br/>
Continue on.  <br/>
<br/>
When the path slopes down there is a sign for Oaks Bottom Wildlife<br/>
Refuge on the left.  Directly across from this sign take a right on the<br/>
trail past the bike rack.  Go up to the bench overlooking the Willamette<br/>
River.  Turn and look the way you came.  From the bench take about 8<br/>
steps.  go right on the dirt trail for 12 steps.  Look right.  The<br/>
ivy-wrapped, multi-branched tree holds the Bike Route Letterbox in its<br/>
heart on the river side beneath leaves and sticks.  Please be discreet.<br/>
This is a very high-traffic area.<br/>
<br/>
