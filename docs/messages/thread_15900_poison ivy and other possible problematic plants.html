I haven't really had a problem out here with poison ivy, oak, or sumack.<br/>
What I do have a problem with is stinging nettle.  Does anyone know if the<br/>
cures mentioned for poison ivy work the same for that particular plant?<br/>
<br/>
just wondering,<br/>

Stinging Nettles!  Ah yes, what fun.  We've found a first aid cream that<br/>
knocks it on it's tracks.  We bought a first aid kit to carry with us and in<br/>
it is a tube of something called  Ambix First Aid Antiseptic and Burn Cream.<br/>
Never heard of it before, but, on one trip, I reached into a stump to get a<br/>
box and brushed a Nettle pant.. Boy oh boy did the itching and burning start<br/>
fast and the skin puffed right where the nettle had every so gently caressed<br/>
my skin.  Well, all we had with us was the aforementioned cream so we used<br/>
it. To my surprise, the pain went away immediately.  Fast forward to a few<br/>
weeks later and the same thing happens to my son and the cream preformed<br/>
magically again.  I'm not sure of the brand name, but the ingredients are as<br/>
follows:<br/>
<br/>
Active:  Dicyclomine HCL 0.5% and Phenol 0.5%<br/>
Other ingredients:  Allantoin, Benzyl Alchol, Disodium EDTA, Glyceryl<br/>
Stearate SE, Mineral Oil, Methyl Paraben, Petrolatum, Propyl Paraben, Sodium<br/>
Lauryl Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Stearyl Alcohol, Trolamine, and Deionized<br/>
Water.<br/>
<br/>
If you can find it, we swear by it.  It's made by Ambix Laboratories Dist in<br/>
East Rutherford, NJ, 07073<br/>

nettles. As far as I know there is nothing else. I grew up in the woods<br/>
and we have always used it for that pupose. Rub the juice from the stalk<br/>
all over the stings but make sure you break it up well enough to get the<br/>
juices out.<br/>
