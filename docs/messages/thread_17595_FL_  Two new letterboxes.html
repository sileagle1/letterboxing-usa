&gt; I'm afraid not.  Miami is almost 400 miles from St Augustine.  So <br/>
unless you are driving down Rt 95, the Guana River box is out.  <br/>
Kissimee is in Central Florida near Orlando.  Florida is a really big <br/>
state!  It would be good to get a map of the Florida State Parks <br/>
before you go from a travel agent or driving club.<br/>

the tail end of Feb and beginning of March for our annual sailing <br/>

I have a new log book and two fresh boxes ready to take along. <br/>
However .... we're looking to see if any local boxers would be <br/>
willing to maintain/adopt them for us.<br/>

For the last several years we've gone down every winter (at least <br/>
for a short visit).  Right now, we don't plan to change that routine <br/>
but one can never be too be sure that far in advance.<br/>
