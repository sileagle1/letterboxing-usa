that they got your e-mail from someplace other than the website. Did<br/>
you put it in one of your log books? Please forward the e-mail to me<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It sounds to me as if you are thinking of LBNA and the list as one and <br/>
the same.  They aren't.  LBNA is the main website for letterboxing <br/>
information and you can be contacted through that.  It is completely <br/>
separate from receiving emails from the letterbox-usa list.  I suspect <br/>
you gave LBNA your other address to register there and those are the <br/>
emails you are receiving.<br/>
<br/>
If that isn't the case and you are just asking about stuff from the <br/>
list, Yahoo only keeps addresses you give.  You can give a couple of <br/>
different addresses.  If you look in your membership details it tells <br/>
you what addresses they have listed.  I log in on my Yahoo address for <br/>
isntance, but there is a separate line where I list an alternate email <br/>
address to receive email.  You can see if there is more than one <br/>
listed.  I do suspect you are registered under the different email <br/>
address with LBNA though.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if this answers your question.  If not, I can see if I can <br/>
find out anything more.<br/>

<br/>
The only time this happens for me is if someone goes to one of my<br/>
websites and I've accidentally used my personal email address on a<br/>
webpage.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, people look at my letterboxing info/webpages, continue to<br/>
wander through my website, and find a really old webpage that has an<br/>
email address that I've partially retired or something.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I'm nodding in agreement with CCL.  Nobody can get an<br/>
email address unless you share it somewhere, with someone, on a<br/>
webpage or in email or with a click on a link that registers your<br/>
browser's default email address.  People in letterboxing don't hack<br/>
into people's Yahoo or other accounts; that just doesn't happen.<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully,<br/>
