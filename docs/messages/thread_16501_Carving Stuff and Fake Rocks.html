                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to the folks who directed me to the plumbers' gasket material. <br/>
I guess it will work for the larger project I have in mind. Actually <br/>
though, I am keeping my stock in Master Carve and pink Speedy Cut. <br/>
Just not a good substitute for either, that gasket. It is more like <br/>
linoleum.<br/>
<br/>
I did find another kind of eraser that works well: Be Sharp. It is <br/>
orange in color and carves nicely. I also found a pack for a dollar <br/>
that offers several small ones (1/2" X 2"0 and a large one about <br/>
twice that size. I think that it is much the same as the white ones <br/>
we have been finding here.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have purchased something that really helps in carving: a <br/>
magnifying glass that clips to the table. The one I got was about $20 <br/>
and is called flexilens on mini-clip, made by daylightcompany.com. I <br/>
saw one with a light and magnifier for $135 at Michaels but finally <br/>
found this one. One cannot carve what one cannot see.<br/>
<br/>
The flexible bonding stuff seems to have set nicely after I sprinkled <br/>
it with a light coat of sand. I think this may be what I am really <br/>
looking for: waterproof, flexible, sticky for part of the time. This <br/>
in combination with my Amoco plaster-based rocks should be a good <br/>
solution to hiding in plain sight.<br/>
<br/>
Back to bed with what seems like the flu. Thanks for your responses <br/>
to the two new polls.<br/>
