here, but it can get even more complicated. I believe the search for <br/>

already knows the location of the box can claim a new find. <br/>
<br/>
Ryan also says if you just change the clues slightly, and move the <br/>
box to a new location, that doesn't make it a new find--I agree here <br/>
as well, but the interesting part of Ryan's analysis is his discourse <br/>
on the intention of the boxer when he says, ". . . did you intend <br/>
to 'move' the letterbox or created a new one from scratch?  If you <br/>
moved it, it won't count as a new find.  If you created it from <br/>
scratch, it's a new box."<br/>

Now I've re-created the stamp (obtained from my stampbook image) of <br/>
another letterboxer's lost letterbox, which was titled "The Succulent <br/>
Box," and placed my version of the stamp in a new letterbox located <br/>
near the original letterbox's location.  I incorporated some of the <br/>
clues from the original letterbox and titled my letterbox "Succulent <br/>
Box II." I consider this to be a new letterbox.  Same stamp image, <br/>
but carved by a different letterboxer, in a new letterbox, placed <br/>
near the original LB location, incorporating some of the original <br/>
LBers clues, but with additional clues by me.  Like I said, it can <br/>
get complicated.<br/>

I'm sorry that my post may have upset you; you're right, letterboxing <br/>
is just about fun, and there are no rules.  I was just tilting with <br/>
Ryan in my post, and didn't mean to offend you. I apologize.<br/>

The hobby has always had rules.  "No rules" just sounds better and <br/>
would be great in an ideal world, but that's never been the case.  =)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I don't know my PFX count accurately anymore.<br/>
<br/>
And as Buzzard mentioned, while most letterboxes tend to be more <br/>
clear-cut about whether a box should count as a new find or not, <br/>
there are always the confusing borderline cases where one could make <br/>
a good case for in either direction.  In a case like that, just count <br/>
it how you feel is most accurate and don't worry about what others <br/>
say.  It's not THAT important!<br/>
