<p>Boston Hollow</p>
<p>Placed: 5-25-02</p>
<p>Placed By: Chuck and Molly</p>
<p>Location: Ashford Connecticut, Windham County</p>
<p>Rated: Moderate, Terrain Difficult, steep hills and path alongside cliffs. 
Lots of uphill hiking. Over a mile and a half to box.</p>
<p></p>
</b><p>WARNING: Tough terrain. Sometimes dangerous. 
Not recommended for children.</p>
<p>Proceed north from the intersection of route 44 and 89 in 
Ashford until you come to a stop sign and blinking red light. See a white church 
in front of you. This area of Ashford is known as Westford. From the church, 
take a right onto Boston Hollow Road and proceed 1.6 miles which turns to gravel 
and find a parking area on the left which is capable of parking 4-5 cars. Park 
here for your starting point.</p>
<p>Boston Hollow Road is in an old fault line that has eroded over 
millions of years. The old road which was at the bottom of it was a public road 
, a stage coach road, and turnpike between Boston and Hartford</p>
<p>Great views along the trail and spectacular when Mountain Laurel 
is in bloom.</p>
<p></p>
<p align="left">Follow the blue blazed Nipmuck trail, the same side 
as the parking area. The letterbox is alongside of the trail. I will give you 8 
landmarks which you must pass to assure you that you are not yet at the 
box.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<ol>
<li>
<div align="left">Cross an old stone wall.</div></li>
<li>
<div align="left">You will pass a pile of stones on your right 
  which were obviously put there by man not nature.</div></li>
<li>
<div align="left">Pass another pile of stones on your right after 
  going slightly downhill<span class="20184316-27052002"> w</span>hich 
  were <span class="20184316-27052002">  </span><span class="20184316-27052002">  </span>put <span class="20184316-27052002">th</span>ere<span class="20184316-27052002"> </span>by man. </div></li>
<li>
<div align="left">Reach a spot called the overlook. There is no 
  sign. It is a cleared out section, near a cliff with lots of small 
  pieces of glass on the ground. This is 7/10 of a mile from your starting point 
  and offers a great view. Path goes along a cliff, then bears right along the 
  winding path away from it. </div></li>
<li>
<div align="left">Path goes down a steep rocky 
  hill.</div></li>
<li>
<div align="left">Come to a very small clearing with half a dozen 
  evergreens and white birch trees at 260 to 280 degrees.</div></li>
<li>
<div align="left">Walk along a ledge ridge with a drop at 120 and 
  300 degrees.</div></li>
<li>
<div align="left">Quickly following the ridge is an intermittent 
  stream. Look across the stream.<span class="20184316-27052002"> </span>You will 
  see a large boulder with 2 other rocks leaning against 
  it.</div></li></ol>
<p align="left">Cross the stream and take 8 steps uphill on the 
trail. Take a reading of 40 degrees and go to the spot between the large boulder 
and the second rock. Look down on the ground and find the letterbox covered with 
a couple flat stones and some pieces of 
wood.</p></body></html>
