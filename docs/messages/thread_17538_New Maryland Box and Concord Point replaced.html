                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to Sam I Am for planting my box out at Turkey Point and for replacing <br/>
the Concord Point box for me!  The Turkey Point box was supposed to have been <br/>
planted last February, but was anable to do so due to the two plus feet of <br/>
snow that was on the ground at the time.<br/>
<br/>
If you do find either one of these boxes, please let me know!  Since I am <br/>
unable to check on them, I do hope to know if they're ok!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
