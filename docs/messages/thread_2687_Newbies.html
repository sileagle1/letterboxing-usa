                    <html><body>Hi all!
<br/>My husband and I are brand new to the Letterboxing wonders and loving it!  We 
<br/>live in Alaska and went searching for out first 2 letterboxes last weekend.  
<br/>We found one (though the clues were uh um er VERY outdated) but couldn't find 
<br/>the other due to, again, VERY outdated clues.  Is there a way to find out 
<br/>when the boxes were set and  how to update the clues?  (ie searching for a 
<br/>tree that no longer exists, now a stump or a clue as a "large live tree" is, 
<br/>in reality, a rather long dead tree or a spruce on the right that jumped to 
<br/>the other side and now lives on the left side of the path)
<br/>
<br/>Happy searching to all!

forum in the past couple of days (I have been reading messages for a couple<br/>
of weeks) I begin to wonder if my first impression of this sport was all<br/>
wrong.  Initially I saw this as a challenging, fun outdoor activity where<br/>
people seemed to be welcoming of beginners.  Up to this point all the people<br/>
I had corresponded with were very welcoming and encouraging of my beginning<br/>
efforts at Letterboxing.  I thought I had found an enjoyable new hobby with<br/>
intriguing people to "chat" with.  Now,  with today's posts,  I begin to<br/>
wonder.  Perhaps I am better off keeping my correspondences with those few<br/>
who have encouraged me and not expecting that the sport, as a whole, is<br/>
welcoming.  I hope there will be people who will jump in and correct my new<br/>
assumptions.  How sad to think you are welcome and then read a post like the<br/>
one posted by WolverineButt.  If I have offended anyone,  my apologies.<br/>
But, here is one newbie who HAS been offended.<br/>

users, especially those who hide behind fake identities as the thoughts<br/>
of the whole is pretty extreme. There's no point to take opinions of<br/>
individuals like WolverineButt seriously, since they hide behind<br/>
throwaway accounts.<br/>
<br/>
I'd say after watching the list as a lurker for over a year, I've<br/>
consistently seen a pretty darn friendly community. A few bad eggs<br/>
shouldn't worry you. If you're offended by the forums, stick with the<br/>
game itself and attend the events where people can't hide behind<br/>
technology.<br/>
<br/>
And WolverineButt, I suggest you figure out a better way of offering<br/>
your "anonymous" opinions. You're not anonymous, and the City of Tacoma<br/>
tax dollars are not meant for you to hide behind a rather transparent<br/>
mask. If you wish to be exposed, keep it up.<br/>

There are NO rules to Letterboxing. There is no "special" club. The LbNA was<br/>
started as a gathering point for those of us who are interested in the<br/>
sport, and we are a loose bunch of people. Some people like keeping track of<br/>
their placed and found boxes (and other stuff), and they enjoy sharing those<br/>
numbers. Frankly I don't even know how many boxes I've found -- I'd have to<br/>
look in my journal.<br/>
<br/>
The people who run this Web site (I am again one of them) do it for FREE,<br/>

We do this to have a more or less central repository of clues within the<br/>
U.S.<br/>
<br/>
So, please ignore those nasty posts, as I said, and stay and have fun! Oh, I<br/>
was wrong -- there IS one rule to Letterboxing: HAVE FUN!<br/>

I personally feel that your first impressions of this group were right<br/>
on.  Overall everyone in this group is friendly, helpful, and welcoming<br/>
of newbies.<br/>
<br/>
Newbies are what make this hobby thrive.  The help it expand, grow,<br/>
stay active, keep it interesting.  Remember, letterboxing had "rules"<br/>
but most are also open to interpretation - something that allows it<br/>
anyone's desired level of participation and/or creativity.<br/>
<br/>
It is to bad that this list has taken on such a ton over the last<br/>
couple of days - but I do believe that this to shall pass.  I think you<br/>
will find that the majority of members here do not agree with<br/>
WolverineButt's viewpoint - or at least the way he/she has chosen to<br/>
express it - and that many are offended by it.  However, we are in the<br/>
great USA, and are all guaranteed the right to freedom of speech and to<br/>
express our opinions.  No where does it state that we all must agree or<br/>
listen, but each of us has the right to say what we think.<br/>
<br/>
All Newbies, please stick around and see the fun this list can be.  In<br/>
the meantime, I encourage you to exercise that delete key or set up<br/>
some mail filters.<br/>
<br/>
May everyone have a GREAT boxing weekend!!<br/>
