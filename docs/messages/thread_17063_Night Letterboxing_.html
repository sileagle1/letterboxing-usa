<br/>
Jonathan and I go letterboxing at night all the time.  I find it to <br/>
make the letterboxes much more challenging.  We went to the point of <br/>
buying a different stamp for our night letterboxing exploits but <br/>
decided it wasn't a good idea.  No-one would know who we were ... we <br/>
would be a regular "LegerDeMaine".  We settled on a little bat stamp <br/>
to add to the books when we do a box at night.<br/>
<br/>
Wanda and Pete are also avid night boxers, we went until 12:30 one <br/>
evening so that Jonathan could hit F50 in ONE DAY!  Gotta love it! :)<br/>
<br/>
My one suggestion to all people that letterbox ... Buy an LED <br/>
headlamp.  Those trails will look like you are walkin' on sunshine!  <br/>
