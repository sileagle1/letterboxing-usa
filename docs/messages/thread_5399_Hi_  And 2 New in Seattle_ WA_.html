<br/>
I've been doing this for a few months now, but just recently joined the <br/>
mailing list and started making my own boxes. :)  I'm Eliza/moderngypsy <br/>
from Seattle, WA (most recently), and I'm kind of a letterboxing <br/>
evangelist lately....<br/>
<br/>
I placed TWO boxes today in the metro Seattle area.  I'll post them <br/>
separately for simplicity's sake.<br/>
<br/>
FIRST is the CARKEEK BOX<br/>
Carkeek park is a fabulous gem on the Sound that I'd never been to until <br/>
today.  It's a salmon spawning ground with miles and miles of trails and <br/>
a model airplane strip....great fun.<br/>
<br/>
To get there from I-5 heading North from downtown:<br/>
Exit at #173.  At the bottom of the ramp, take a left onto 1st Ave. NE, <br/>
then another left on Northgate Way.  Go west on Northgate, cross Aurora, <br/>
and take a right on Greenwood Ave.  Turn left on 110th Street (it's at a <br/>
stoplight and the way left is kind of hidden.  If you miss it, you can <br/>
just go around the block to get back to it.)  After 110th crosses 3rd <br/>
Ave, it becomes Carkeek Park Rd, and winds down into a lush green canopy <br/>
until it hits the bottom.  Turn left to get into the park and stay <br/>
straight unless you want to go visit the Environmental Learning Center.<br/>
<br/>
Just past the Carkeek Trail sign, park in the lot on the left, near the <br/>
kiosk.  On the end closest to the Emerald outhouse and facing the exit, <br/>
take the small trail to your left (north).  You'll know you're on the <br/>
right one if there is a small sign to your left saying "Bicycle Use <br/>
Prohibited on this Trail" next to the trailhead.<br/>
<br/>
Plunge into the gurgling wilderness with the stream and waterfalls to <br/>
your right.  Continue up, past the gnarled dragon-head stump, and around <br/>
the first switchback.  The trail goes for a bit after the switchback <br/>
with few identifying features and only a slight incline.  Pretend you're <br/>
a dinosaur traversing the ancient wilderness, and continue onward.<br/>
<br/>
The next switchback is small but steep.  Go over the log to your <br/>
right(-ish).  You're on the right path if you go over another log in <br/>
about five steps, just past a tree on your right.<br/>
<br/>
All of a sudden, it's a -very- steep trail.  About half way up the steep <br/>
is a green post on the right and a clearing.  Keep going past it.<br/>
<br/>
Go around the corner that looks like a small landslide, (to your left is <br/>
a 2-in-1 tree).<br/>
<br/>
Near the end, the path goes through a cut log. (if you hit the road, <br/>
you've gone too far...) On the left is half the log that is <br/>
perpendicular to the path; on the right is the other half, parallel to <br/>
the road. Under the end of that log, closest to the road, is a second <br/>
log piece.  The letterbox is there, under the second log, covered with <br/>
leaves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting! I'm planning on popping another two boxes here when time <br/>
permits.<br/>
