<br/>
Clan Jiggs took advantage of the perfect combination of California <br/>
weather and Don and Gwen's hospitality to do a little white knuckle, <br/>
er water rafting and a little boxing!<br/>
<br/>
Much to our amazement and delight, we found A BRAND NEW CAR key, <br/>
which we were informed, was the very key Silent Doug was looking <br/>
for!!  My daughter was so proud of this find that she promptly <br/>
announced that EVERYONE should know how Doug locked THIS VERY KEY in <br/>
his CAR during his visit to Kernville last fall!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, by the way, we think the ju-ju involved with losing this key <br/>
must be contagious - when we went to check out of our hotel this <br/>
mosning we discovered that we had lost not one, BUT BOTH of our room <br/>
keys....soooo this puppy is movin' on real soon!<br/>
