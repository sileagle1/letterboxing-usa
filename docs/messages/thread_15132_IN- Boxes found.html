                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today I loaded up all four dogs and my mother in law "Rusty" into the van and went in search of three new boxes placed by Franzsolo in Indiana. Here's what we found:<br/>
<br/>
"Cedar Grove" was dry and in good condition. I encourage everyone to check out this quaint little historic church that is open to the public.<br/>
<br/>
The "Pencil Rubbing Box" in Franklin County park found. The container had been tasted by a critter. Scratches from it's teeth were visible. I think it might have put a small crack in the box, but it was hard to tell if it went all the way through. I wedged a lot more bark around the box to try to keep any critters from carrying the box away. Contents were safe and dry inside the baggie.<br/>
<br/>
"Waterfall" Found, but unfortunately, it was soaked inside. The container had gotten opened slightly and was full of water. I rinsed the gunk off the stamp, dried it out and replaced the container and log book. I also put the whole thing inside a baggie, just in case. It should be fine now. At first I thought it was a HH, but saw that it was a little bit different image :-)<br/>
