will be joining in on September 18.  It is called National Public <br/>
Lands Day.  My Scout troop will be participating in a project to <br/>
keep the trails from being eroded by cleaning water bars around the <br/>
trails.  It will be in the Park that I found my first letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
In all likelihood there is a project near you!  Check out this <br/>
website and put your state in to see where you can join in.  We get <br/>
so much our of the public lands, now is another opportunity to give <br/>
back.<br/>

Enjoy!<br/>
