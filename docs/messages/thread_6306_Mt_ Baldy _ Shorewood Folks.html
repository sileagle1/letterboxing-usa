                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have NO idea where your box is! :(  I walked/stumbled up the 282 steps -- tangoing trees at stepp 55? -- went down the other side of the MOUNTAIN of sand, immediately came to a fork and continued straight ahead for 38 paces -- or rather 38 ski-paces down a 35' MOUNTAIN of sand! -- and STILL I could find no dancing trees.  I did manage to see a tree that was downed off to the right that LOOSELY resembled a centipede but could find nothing at, around, under, behind or in it.  So, I continued to ski down the rest of the mountain to Oval Beach, emptied out my shoes so they were restored from size 10 back to their original size 12, then took the beach road back to my car and back to my campsite at Van Buren State Park.  Thanks for the exercise!  Now I don't have to run my daily 3 miles for the rest of the week!<br/>
