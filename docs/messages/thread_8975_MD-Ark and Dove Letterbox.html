                    <div class="plaintext-content">The hike to the Ark and Dove box is pretty short.  If you will <br/>
already be in the historic section, it will take you only a couple of <br/>
minutes to get the box and get back to the kids.  If you are taking <br/>
them on a history field trip, consider going to Point Lookout too.  <br/>
The other box we placed is right near Fort Lincoln and the park is <br/>
loaded with history.  The Fort Lincoln box would only take a couple <br/>
of minutes too.<br/>
