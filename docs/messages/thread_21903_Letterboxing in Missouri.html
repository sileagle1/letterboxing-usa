<br/>
I'm fairly new to Letterboxing (actually VERY new).   I've checked the <br/>
Letterboxing.org website and started down the list of boxes placed in <br/>
my county.  So far out of the first 5 I've gone looking for, none of <br/>
them have been there (stolen? out of date clues?)... Is this something <br/>
that is encountered often?  Is anyone on here from Clay County, <br/>
Missouri and encountered this same problem?  After an exciting start <br/>
(what with getting my stamp all made :), this was sort of a let down <br/>
day :(...<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone else is having happier hunting!!<br/>

Part of the challenge in letterboxing is that there are no guarantees<br/>
that the box will be there. There is also no assurance that you will<br/>
find a box on the very first try. There are some clues that after 2<br/>
years, I am still baffled at solving. Just hang in there, move on to<br/>
some new boxes and try again!<br/>
<br/>
In the case of Maine, we found all the boxes in a nearby area, none<br/>
left to find, so we just started planting them, and the rest is history!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome to our addiction. Unfortunately, there are times when you will not<br/>
find any of the boxes you seek. They may have been stolen, the clues may be<br/>
out of date, or you may not be looking in quite the right spot. I've had<br/>
boxes I was SURE must been gone. I just KNOW I was in the right spot, only<br/>
to have the owner check on it and assure me the box was there. It is on<br/>
those hunts that you have to remember the beauty of the hike, the cleverness<br/>
of the clues, and the joy of being outdoors LIVING life instead of sitting<br/>
in a chair watching it go by you. <br/>
<br/>
I hope you find many boxes in your life time, don't let a less than perfect<br/>
start get you down!<br/>

were all OK.  Also check the Missouri mystery page for another one of <br/>

don't appear to be active anymore.  Don't get discouraged, this is a <br/>
great hobby and we have had nothing but fun participating.  Although <br/>
we are leaving Clay we won't be far away and will continue to try <br/>
to "seed" north of the river.  If you have any trouble finding any of <br/>
our boxes, drop us a line and we will try to give you a hand.<br/>

<br/>
I was recently in Clay county for a couple of months.  While there I<br/>
found Craw and Joey's Fountain #1 and their mystery box.  I am not<br/>
from Clay county so I had to do some research to find the location of<br/>
the mystery box but the whole process was fun.  And the fountain where<br/>
they placed it is probably my favorite :)<br/>
<br/>
While in Clay county, I searched for the Unity box but the landscape<br/>
had changed since the box was placed.  I countacted the placer who<br/>
checked on the box and changed the clues.<br/>
<br/>
In the surrounding area, I found Jim the Wonderdog box in Marshall, MO<br/>
and St Mary's box in Leavenworth.  I searched for Centennial at<br/>
Leavenworth Landing Park, but I am pretty sure that one is missing.  I<br/>
contacetd the placer who is not local and could not go check on it.<br/>
But if you go looking for the St mary's box, a quick trip to<br/>
Leavenworth Landing Park is a quick side trip to a nice, interesting <br/>
little park. EVEN if there is no letter box. :)<br/>
<br/>
There is another one I wanted to try but never did...Waverly Apple<br/>
Festival.  It is out from Clay county but I am pretty sure it is there.<br/>
<br/>
I emailed the placer of some boxes in Liberty in a park...Scardale<br/>
park???not sure of the name of the park, before I went to search.  I<br/>
never heard back from them so I did not go searching.<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing :)<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are in Clay county and have planted Fountain Series #1 and Hop to <br/>
&gt; It that have been found or checked on by us in the last month and <br/>
&gt; were all OK.  Also check the Missouri mystery page for another one of <br/>
&gt; ours that is in Clay.  We've noticed that a lot of the ones listed on <br/>
&gt; LBNA for Clay county are pretty old and were listed by boxers that <br/>
&gt; don't appear to be active anymore.  Don't get discouraged, this is a <br/>
&gt; great hobby and we have had nothing but fun participating.  Although <br/>
&gt; we are leaving Clay we won't be far away and will continue to try <br/>
&gt; to "seed" north of the river.  If you have any trouble finding any of <br/>
&gt; our boxes, drop us a line and we will try to give you a hand.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lots of luck,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello all, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm fairly new to Letterboxing (actually VERY new).   I've <br/>
&gt; checked the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Letterboxing.org website and started down the list of boxes <br/>
&gt; placed in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my county.  So far out of the first 5 I've gone looking for, none <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them have been there (stolen? out of date clues?)... Is this <br/>
&gt; something <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that is encountered often?  Is anyone on here from Clay County, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Missouri and encountered this same problem?  After an exciting <br/>
&gt; start <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (what with getting my stamp all made :), this was sort of a let <br/>
&gt; down <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; day :(...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope everyone else is having happier hunting!!<br/>
