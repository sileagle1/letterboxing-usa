&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; After hibernating for the winter, the Algerine Coast Letterbox has<br/>
&gt; returned<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the shore but has had to be moved due to Mother Nature's <br/>
rearranging<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the shoreline.  The clues should be corrected to read as follows:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; SOUTHWEST HARBOR, MAINE<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mount Desert Island, Maine<br/>
&gt; &gt; Planted September 1, 2002<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nearest Town - Southwest Harbor, Hancock County<br/>
&gt; &gt; Difficulty - Easy Clues, easy terrain<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The Algerine Coast will not be found on a map.  Many locals do not <br/>
even<br/>
&gt; know<br/>
&gt; &gt; this name for this quiet little cove.  Legend suggests that the <br/>
name<br/>
comes<br/>
&gt; &gt; from the long-ago wreck of a sailing ship from Algeria.  For those <br/>
who<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; discovered this place, it is a lovely spot for a picnic or just for<br/>
&gt; walking<br/>
&gt; &gt; along the shore and exploring the tidal pools.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; DIRECTIONS<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; From Route 102 in Southwest Harbor take Seal Cove Road into the <br/>
Park.<br/>
&gt; This<br/>
&gt; &gt; begins as a paved road but as it enters the park it becomes a<br/>
"washboard"<br/>
&gt; &gt; dirt road.  Slow down and enjoy the forest.  You will pass several <br/>
Park<br/>
&gt; &gt; roads and trails for future excursions.  Be watchful for hikers and<br/>
bikers<br/>
&gt; &gt; as this is a very narrow road.  When you reach the end of Seal Cove <br/>
Road<br/>
&gt; &gt; turn right onto Route 102.  Continue for just over 2/10 mile.  The <br/>
road<br/>
&gt; &gt; curves over tidal water and then you will see a land locked red <br/>
bouy on<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; left.  Turn here and continue down the road to the landing.  Park <br/>
on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; right.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; CLUES<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Facing the water, go to the right of the picnic area and you will <br/>
find a<br/>
&gt; &gt; path down to the shore. To your right again you will see two trees <br/>
on a<br/>
&gt; &gt; point on the shore.  Walk toward them until the smallest tree is<br/>
directly<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; your right.  Take about 45 steps at 330'. (Note - I have short <br/>
legs).<br/>
On<br/>
&gt; &gt; your right you will see many boulders with rose bushes growing <br/>
behind<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This beach has a fascinating variety of stones - slate, schist and <br/>
many<br/>
&gt; &gt; colors of granite.  Look for a particularly large and somewhat flat<br/>
&gt; &gt; outcropping with veins of granite it in it.  Here you will find <br/>
your<br/>
&gt; &gt; treasure covered in rust.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This is my first letterbox and first ever attempt at carving a <br/>
stamp.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; hope you enjoy it.  I would love to hear from you - <br/>

&gt; &gt; (Note, this is a popular spot for campfires and kayakers.  Please <br/>
be<br/>
&gt; &gt; discreet and be sure to replace the box so that it is well hidden.<br/>
&gt; Thanks!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
