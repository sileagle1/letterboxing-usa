other is in Metamora, an historic village of crafters, shops &amp; inns with a<br/>
working grist mill &amp; both a train and horse drawn canal boat that you can<br/>
ride (read below for more details). They have been entered on the new site,<br/>
but FRANKLIN COUNTY NEEDS TO BE HIGHLIGHTED (S.E. Ind.) by the webmasters<br/>
(Thank-you)<br/>
<br/>
** Historic Little Cedar Grove Baptist Church**<br/>
Difficulty: EASY<br/>
Walking Distance: A drive up<br/>
No compass needed<br/>
<br/>
Directions: See the directions for the Old Metamora Mill below. (This box is<br/>
on the way to Metamora) and is just past White's Farm (a very large place<br/>
with a big sign)<br/>
<br/>
History: The Little Cedar Grove Baptist Church was built in 1812. This is<br/>
the oldest church building still in it's original location in the state. The<br/>
exterior walls show rifle openings used to defend it in wilder times. The<br/>
interior has a balcony, fire pit and raised pulpit. The church is open for<br/>
you to wander through and enjoy. A very old burial plot adjoins the church.<br/>
Some internet research turned up the burial records which shows about 14<br/>
graves of mostly children. Don't miss the very old outhouse in back of the<br/>
church, it's worth a peek inside to make you appreciate the plumbing you<br/>
have. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Clues: You can park in front of the church by the split rail fence. Walk<br/>
around the church to the right. As you near the back corner of the building,<br/>
you will see a cut stump between the church and the brush along the ridge<br/>
(watch your kids and pets, the drop off is a long way down to the river).<br/>
The camo covered container is located at the base of the stump under some<br/>
bark and a rock. Please re-hide the rock and container well. The pews inside<br/>
the church would be a good place to stamp in.<br/>
Let me know if you find it!<br/>

** Old Metamora Mill **<br/>
Difficulty: EASY<br/>
Walking Distance: very short if you park by the mill<br/>
No compass needed<br/>
Pets welcomed, but not in some of the stores or the mill. Note, there are<br/>
ducks everywhere. If your dog is likely to try to chase them or make dog<br/>
perfume out of their droppings, you might want to leave them home :-)<br/>
<br/>
Metamora is located about 45 min. North West of Cincinnati and not too far<br/>
from Chillicothe. Directions from Cinci are below the history.<br/>
<br/>
HISTORY: The historic village of Metamora, Indiana sits on land acquired<br/>
from the Indians on September 30, 1809. On October 22, 1811, a government<br/>
land grant for 160 acres was issued to Larkin Sims. On July 6, 1812, it was<br/>
assigned to David Mount. The first Post Office was established in April,<br/>
1826, at which time the town was registered as Duck Creek Crossing.<br/>
<br/>
The town was platted on three acres by David Mount and William Holland,<br/>
March 20, 1838. On June 11, 1838, the town officially became known as<br/>
Metamora. The name was proposed by Mrs. John A. Matson, who named it after<br/>
an Indian character in a New York City play.<br/>
<br/>
Through the center of Metamora runs the White Water canal. The White Water<br/>
Canal Company was incorporated in 1826. Not until 1847 was the canal<br/>
completed to Hagerstown. It stretched for 76 miles, operated by 56 locks and<br/>
7 feeder dams. The White Water Valley Railroad purchased the canal in 1866.<br/>
The railroad laid their tracks atop the old tow path and allowed the canal<br/>
to deteriorate. Flour and woolen mills, built from 1845-1848, thrived for a<br/>
while, but either burned or were abandoned. In 1947, the Indiana Department<br/>
of Natural Resources created a state historic site at the old canal. In the<br/>
early 1960s, the DNR began taking passengers on short canal trips through<br/>
the Duck Creek Aqueduct.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT TO SEE: The mill museum was dedicated in 1973 by Governor Otis Bowen.<br/>
Today, it is open to show people a working, water powered grain mill. Grain<br/>
that has been ground by this mill is available for sale. The Whitewater<br/>
Valley Railroad began excursion passenger service in 1974 and train rides<br/>
are still available. You can also take a ride on a horse drawn boat along a<br/>
section of the canal. In 1968, Metamora began attracting some modern<br/>
pioneers. These independent individuals were in search of history and<br/>
creative inspiration. Artists opened galleries. Entrepreneurs sell antiques.<br/>
Crafters demonstrate their skills. Currently there are over 100 shops, inns<br/>
and restaurants located along the Old Metamora section of the canal.<br/>

DIRECTIONS: From Cincinnati: Take I-74 West to Exit 169 (Brookville). Go<br/>
left toward Brookville (Rt. 52 West). Go 14.3 miles (youll pass through<br/>
historic downtown Brookville, which is also worth some sight seeing time).<br/>
After Brookville, bear left on 52 West toward the Whitewater Canal State<br/>
Historic Site. Go 7.7 more miles and watch for the sign on the left marking<br/>
the entrance to Old Metamora. At Main Street, turn right and find a place to<br/>
park (free parking lot by the mill). Note: This place is sometimes like a<br/>
ghost town on weekdays, but it is very busy on weekends. If you want to<br/>
really experience the town, go on a weekend.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES: Behind the Mill is the Water Wheel and Lock #25. As you cross the<br/>
foot bridge take a moment to watch the wheel at work, powered by falling<br/>
water. At the end of the short bridge, turn LEFT. Sit on the stone walkway<br/>
at the inside corner and watch the ducks swim by. If you reach between your<br/>
feet, there should be a microbox (camo film container) hidden under a<br/>
crevice in the rock. The picnic area would be a good place to stamp up.<br/>
Please be discrete, since this place is really busy at times.  Re-hide the<br/>
container from view when you are done. More letterboxes are in the works for<br/>
this town. Look for clues here soon.<br/>
