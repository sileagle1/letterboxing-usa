                    <div class="plaintext-content">Coming from a current job position where I can identify with this <br/>
warning, I understand the difficulty in opening a trail to the <br/>
public. I currently work for a non-profit that has a trail, but the <br/>
designated land use policy is on private land. It becomes challenging <br/>
to maintain the property for public use on the grounds that it is <br/>
still private and subject to the land use restrictions of said <br/>
organization.<br/>
<br/>
I have opted to NOT place an advertised box at the moment, not only <br/>
for the protection of the trail and fragile wetland ecosystem on this <br/>
property, but because the land use policy has not been fully <br/>
established as of yet. Right now it is advertised that it is open to <br/>
the public on a call-notify basis. As long as the organization is <br/>
notified and made aware then it is alright.<br/>
<br/>
As a suggestion for people and/or organizations that might encouter <br/>
this problem, maintain open lines of (educational) communication and <br/>
hopefully everyone will benefit. The letterboxers might suggest doing <br/>
a workshop on a trail or for the organization. I've found a display <br/>
or even the clue printed but left at the office might also help. If <br/>
there is a way to establish this relationship with a conservation <br/>
organization then they are more willing to check up on the box also. <br/>
A great example of this are the boxes placed at the State Forest <br/>
system in Connecticut. I think they have taken a pioneering step in <br/>
promoting this activity as educational as well as eco-friendly.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in more details about how to handle this, <br/>
please email me off the list for a discussion. <br/>
Thanks, phyto<br/>

&gt; I am the Executive Director of Beaver Brook Association. I was <br/>
&gt; recently alerted to the fact that your site lists two letterbox <br/>
&gt; locations on our property. Although we are not opposed to this <br/>
&gt; activity on our property, these particular locations were not <br/>
&gt; approved by our organization. Unfortunately this is fastly becoming <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; frequent problem. Our land is open to the public, but it is private <br/>
&gt; and any use other than the usual passive recreation activities need <br/>
&gt; to be OK'd with staff. Please alert the people who placed these <br/>
&gt; letterboxes that they will be removed and can be picked up at our <br/>
&gt; office. We will gleadly work with them to determine a mutually <br/>
&gt; beneficial site.<br/>
