Placed 2/18/02<br/>
Westerville, Ohio   Franklin County<br/>
Difficulty: 1<br/>
Micro box<br/>
<br/>
The 4th box placed in the series: Art in Public<br/>
places.  To find the area where to look for these<br/>
letterboxes all you have to do is go to<br/>
www.sculpturecenter.org/oosi/oo.asp. Once here you go<br/>
to searching oosi, you can either enter the artist<br/>
name or the name of the letterbox title under advance<br/>
query. This will take you to the site about this<br/>
sculpture and where it is located. Once you find out<br/>
where to head then read the clues to find the<br/>
letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
Kenneth S. Foltz finished this piece in 1990 and it<br/>
was placed in a park honoring Americas Astronauts.<br/>
There are three parks in this area and over on<br/>
Cleveland Avenue is Knights Ice Cream, stop and try<br/>
one of their Knight sticks.<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox clues:  Standing looking at the front of the<br/>
sculpture were the inscription starts:  America I<br/>
took star.. Stand in the second ring of bricks<br/>
surrounding the sculpture. Go 28 paces (1paces=2<br/>
steps) at 310 degrees. Turn and look to your rights.<br/>
About two steps away is a stump. The mini box is in<br/>
the stump. Be careful the middle is completely gone.<br/>
You need to take your own pen and stamp pad. Hope you<br/>
enjoy the area.<br/>
<br/>
