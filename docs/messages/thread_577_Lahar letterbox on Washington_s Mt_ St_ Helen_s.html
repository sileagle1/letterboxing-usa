(if this repeated I appoligize, I'm not sure how to post)<br/>
<br/>
This is one exciting and beautiful area.  This new letterbox is high up<br/>
in the Cascade Mountains or Washington State; on the flanks of the<br/>
lower 48's most active volcano.  Located in the washed out lahar area<br/>
on the Southside of Mount Saint Helen's .  A lahar is a mud or debris<br/>
flow.  This particular lahar occurred when Mount Saint Helen's erupted<br/>
on May 18th, 1980.  The initial explosion instantly melted the<br/>
shoestring glacier and the lahar totally washed away a mile wide and<br/>
several mile long swath of the mountain.  Needless to say the area is<br/>
uniquely beautiful.  <br/>
<br/>
Initially Cara and I wanted to hide the letterbox somewhere on the Ape<br/>
Canyon Trail.  We carried the box up past timberline and then around to<br/>
the Plains of Abraham (a pumice field on the flanks on Saint Helen's<br/>
with a few small glaciers looming overhead).  It is about 13 miles<br/>
round trip to the Plains of Abraham and I strongly recommend hiking up<br/>
there.  The Ape Canyon trail parallels the lahar for 5 miles up the<br/>
side of the mountain.  The trail mostly goes through an old growth<br/>
forest with trees that are thickly draped with goats beard moss. <br/>
<br/>
We did not hide the letterbox on the trail though.  It seemed too<br/>
difficult to come up with clues that would make the box semi-easy to<br/>
find.  I would hate to have some one drive all the way out there and<br/>
hike all the way in only to get lost looking for the only letter box up<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
So where is it?<br/>
<br/>
The letterbox is hidden in the lahar area just south of the lahar<br/>
viewpoint parking area.<br/>
