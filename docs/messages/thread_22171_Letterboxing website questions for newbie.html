<br/>
We are avid geocachers who are also getting into Letterboxing and <br/>
enjoyig it. We found our first 3 letterboxes this past week, and <br/>
there was one we attempted but could not find.<br/>
<br/>
Is there somewhere where there are FAQ's on the actual Letterboxing <br/>
website (On how to navigate or understand little things about the <br/>
website itself)? We noticed that when searching this letterbox online <br/>
that there was a "green flag" icon next to it, whereas the ones we <br/>
found did not have that. Does this mean is was disabled or <br/>
temporarily lost or something?<br/>
<br/>
While I understand the sport itself, I am just trying to figure out <br/>
the little nuances of the website. <br/>
<br/>
Also...is there a way/place I can read past comments from others who <br/>
visited the letterbox?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

Hi B-N-B,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the addiction. While there are a number of letterboxers<br/>
that will probably post an answer here on this list, I would rather<br/>
refer you to a number of great sites where you can find your<br/>
answers. I tend to be from the point of view that will "teach you to<br/>
fish, rather than give you fish"<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few sites you can check out and find most of the answers<br/>
to your questions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing.org:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html<br/>
<br/>
Silent Doug's site:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/<br/>
Doug probably has the best info site on Hitch hikers<br/>
<br/>
AtlasQuest:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/<br/>
Ryan has a link set up "Code of Conduct" that is really good for all<br/>
boxers to read<br/>
<br/>
newboxers' group:<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
Where there is no dumb question, and is "the" place for many<br/>
newletterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also...is there a way/place I can read past comments from others who <br/>
&gt; visited the letterbox?<br/>
<br/>
There isn't a listing of comments like the geocaching site. There are <br/>
regional list as well as the newboxer list and this list.<br/>
