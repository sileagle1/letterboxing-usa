hunntinton beach,it was placed in a letterbox in that area,my email,    <br/>
r2d2zdw@aol.com, is on it for anyone to report its status...So if you find it,email <br/>
me on its status!(info in the HH)...Oh yeah it has three stamps,that why  it <br/>
is called SWbuds,if you find it you can ither keep then together,or spread them <br/>
out,if you plan on spreading them out,you should(it would be kind),make two <br/>
more little stapled booklets for the other two(there is already one for all <br/>
three,but its your choice to ither spread or keep together(if you keep together <br/>
you don`t* have to make two other booklets! Well its your choice LBers!Happy <br/>
hunt!<br/>
<br/>
PS:Three stamps in one,you must be thinking,well I am different thats <br/>
all..SWbuds=Star Wars buddies..and LBers=LetterBoxers! <br/>
