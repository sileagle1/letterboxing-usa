I've only been doing this a year and haven't seen these before. Is <br/>
this new? <br/>
Can anytone tell me what they mean.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, I think some of us, whom I won't embarrass, are getting <br/>
a little too carried away with numbers. Does it really matter if you <br/>
have found 15 boxes or 1500? No, of course not. Some people aren't <br/>
physically able to devote too much to the hobby, now-apparently a <br/>
competive sport, yet enjoy it as much for the simple fact your off in <br/>
the woods. <br/>
<br/>
I admit I haven't found 100's of boxes. I only wear an LBNA numbers <br/>
patch on my backpack on the off chance a person might see them and <br/>
introduce themselves, not to establish some sort of hierarchy. I <br/>
guess I'm just not an in-your-face kinda guy. I think like the rest <br/>
of society, status and aggressiveness are leaking into the <br/>
letterboxing community.<br/>
I think the website volunteers are the only ones who should be <br/>
allowed to brag extensively about anything! <br/>

To me, it just sounds like somebody that's taking the hobby just <br/>
a little too seriously (or maybe an over-excited newbie), but what <br/>
the heck?  It's not like it's doing any harm.  *shrug*  If they feel <br/>
better breaking down their numbers like this, why should it <br/>
bother anyone else?<br/>

I am certainly not trying to be competitive about anything.  I love this sport and was excited by the fact that I had found my 100th box.  I was merely trying to share my excitement, not one-up anyone.   If someone took offense to this, I'm sorry.  But, that isn't going to lessen the fact that I'm excited about it.<br/>

you <br/>

&gt; I admit I haven't found 100's of boxes. I only wear an LBNA numbers <br/>
&gt; patch on my backpack on the off chance a person might see them and <br/>
&gt; introduce themselves, not to establish some sort of hierarchy. I <br/>
&gt; guess I'm just not an in-your-face kinda guy. I think like the rest <br/>

<br/>I agree. This is not a competitive sport. Letterboxing is not a zero-sum game. However, I don't think anyone is advocating turning our hobby into a competitive sport, and I don't think that people (like me and my family, for instance) who enjoy their stat line are trying to make it so.
<br/>
<br/>I count for two reasons. First and foremost, it's fun, and watching those numbers climb makes me smile. :-)

&gt; L= Lost?<br/>
<br/>
"Lost" certainly seems to be on the mark ... as for "Vaccinated", the <br/>
vaccine obviously hasn't worked, as RR still seems to be infecting some <br/>
peoples' activities ... (its interesting to note, tho, that the largest <br/>
known concentration of LBs is in an NP ...)<br/>
<br/>
Another observation, which I think is more obvious, is that from a purely <br/>
bandwitdh standpoint, the discussion of the stats has far exceeded the <br/>
annoyance of the stats, at least for the next 10,000 years or so (which<br/>
I think even exceeds the half-life of tupperware, much less my attention<br/>
span ...)<br/>
<br/>
(I guess "liberumarbitrium" gets the point (well, e's even admitted e gets<br/>
the point), but anyway, nothing wrong with sending lots of messages about<br/>
fun ... so long as the messages in and of themselves are fun (my messages <br/>
try to be fun, but that's up to the reader, as any good semiotician <br/>
knows ...))<br/>
<br/>
(tho its not going too far out on a limb to observe that some people<br/>
could find it "clich" to add a letter for everything that happens out<br/>
on the trail, but to each is own ... clich can be fun ...)<br/>
