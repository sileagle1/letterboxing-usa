                    <div class="plaintext-content">I suggest these very simple rules for counting HHs.<br/>
<br/>
A HH found in a letterbox shall be counted as a minus 1 find until: <br/>
1) the HH has been placed into a new box and 2) the HH creator has <br/>
been sent a status update on the HH. Once these requirements are met <br/>
the HH can be counted as a plus 1 find, but only once. That is, if <br/>
you subsequently find the same HH, it again counts as a minus one <br/>
until 1) and 2) are again met, but then counts as a zero, but not <br/>
nullifing the original plus one. Notwithstanding the above, a HH <br/>
found a 10th time may be counted as an addtional plus 1. If in the <br/>
case that the HH creator has not left contact information with the <br/>
HH, then 2) can be waived. Instead of fulfilling 1), a boxer may <br/>
mail or give the HH to another letterboxer but a plus one can only <br/>
be recorded if/when the second boxer provides a notarized statement <br/>
that 1) and 2) have been met. Until such time, the HH counts as a <br/>
zero. Instead of fulfilling 1), a HH may be brought to a gathering. <br/>
In this case the HH remains counted as a minus one unless you also <br/>
bring a particularly yummy dessert to share. With a three fifths <br/>
vote of the gathering that the dessert is indeed yummy, the HH count <br/>
shall be plus one for every vote over the three fifths threshold. <br/>
This count should be rounded down unless doing so would make the <br/>
count a prime number. For the purposes of these rules, one is <br/>
considered prime.<br/>
<br/>
For HHs "found" at a gathering, the yummy dessert rule shall apply <br/>
but only one dessert per HH. HHs found above the number of yummy <br/>
desserts brought, shall count as minus 1 unless the finder takes the <br/>
HH from the gathering. In that case, the "found in a box" rules <br/>
shall apply. Notwithstanding the preceeding, HHs beyond the yummy <br/>
dessert count, and not taken from the gathering, count as plus one <br/>
if stamped with at least seven colors, one of which must be cerise. <br/>
Periwinkle is not allowed.<br/>
<br/>
The HH count which results from the above rules shall be modified as <br/>
follows. If the HH has NOT been stamped into by Amanda from Seattle, <br/>
an additional plus one may be taken, but only if the HH is at least <br/>
one year old. If the HH was found in a previously unfound box, an <br/>
additional plus one may be taken, but only if the HH was not created <br/>
by the host box placer. Any HH found in North Dakota gives an <br/>
additional plus one, but only if the HH is removed from North <br/>
Dakota. For the purposes of these rules, South Dakota, Montana, and <br/>
Connecticut qualify as North Dakota for removal purposes. <br/>
<br/>
I believe these rules to be quite obvious and noncontroversial. Can <br/>
the webmasters please add them to the FAQ?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
