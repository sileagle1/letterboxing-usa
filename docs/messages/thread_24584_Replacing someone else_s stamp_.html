It looks to me like the Planter has stopped checking in on the box for<br/>
whatever reason.  It has been without a stamp for quite awhile.<br/>

My question is... if this Planter is unreachable, would it be okay to<br/>
carve a stamp for the box? I wish I had made note of what it looked like<br/>
(I'm pretty sure it was stamped inside the cover).  If I replaced it,<br/>
should I copy the original design? ohhnoooz copywrite infringement!<br/>
Maybe not.  Hmm... So It may just be best to try to create a similar<br/>
stamp or a totally new one.<br/>

Its like I feel like I should adopt these boxes that other people are<br/>

But you might want to adopt and then archive the box. There was a discussion back in May about whether it's better to adopt or archive abandoned boxes. You can read it here:<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/message/59734<br/>
<br/>
I had initially been in favor of adopting but there were good arguments made (as you'll see in the thread) that it's better to archive abandoned boxes. If the spot is a nice one, plant a new box there. That way you get credit for the plant and everyone else can find a new stamp. <br/>
