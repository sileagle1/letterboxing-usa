busy that we haven't had much time for the things that really <br/>
matter...so it was a delight when M, the kids, and I blew off the <br/>
afternoon yesterday and spent some quality time by the sea in Rhode <br/>
Island. It was a marvelous day; sunny, fresh breeze, seals on the <br/>
inshore rocks and black backed gulls overhead (how can they be so <br/>
numerous in RI and virtually absent in CT?).<br/>
<br/>
We also replaced one of our favorite letterboxes, "Beavertail Light," <br/>
in Jamestown. Hope you get a chance to visit!<br/>
