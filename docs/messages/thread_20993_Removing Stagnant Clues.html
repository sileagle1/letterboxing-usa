Sticking my head up out the swamp to reply to this one.  Although I <br/>
agree Boxes should be kept up to date by the placer a mass removal <br/>
by moderators isn't wise.  Speaking from experience, I was victim of <br/>
mass deletion back in the early days.  My internet access died for <br/>
months during all the notices and emails. When I finnaly got <br/>
reconnected I didn't know I had been dumped till a (the only) local <br/>
lbr' contacted me.  We have several boxes that may be missing down <br/>
here but the placer is MIA but that doesn't mean the box is.  If <br/>
someone that has found the box does concur that it is missing then <br/>
move it to an archive.<br/>
I added my clues to AQ so the hunter can see when the last find was <br/>
and other useful info at a glance.<br/>
