Hail all!<br/>
<br/>
   Just wanted you to know that I posted a picture of the Cap'n (me!) <br/>
on our ring's photo page and encourage others to do the same so we <br/>
can see who we are "talking" to.  This way, you can get a look at who <br/>
you are replying to, sending packages to, or who is finding your <br/>
letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
   The picture is of me in my "garb" at the Central Coast Renaissance <br/>
Festival held in San Luis Obispo, its our local faire.  I am the <br/>
Captain of the imaginary ship, the "Galendere" which sails the high <br/>
seas looking for piratical adventure!  However, when we are at the <br/>
Ojai Faires, our friend brings a 16 foot replica tall ship and we go <br/>
sailing and have ship to shore battles, I have posted that a picture <br/>
of that ship also.  When we set sail to each faire, we go in our Ken <br/>
Kesey/Partridge Family style painted Gypsy Bus! You can see a picture <br/>
of that also.  <br/>
<br/>
   I am also the Guildmistress for the crew, the "Gypsy Pyrates", a <br/>
pirate reenactment guild that travels to faires and SCA events <br/>
throughout California. We have a very large encampment with three <br/>
large period style pavilions and lots of props.  We are famous for <br/>
our homemade Irish Cream which we call "The G-Creme"!  We also make <br/>
another brew called "The Gypsy Jizz", sounds vulgar don't they? Well, <br/>
we arrrrre pyrates after all! Our website is:<br/>
<br/>
www.GypsyPyrates.com  <br/>
<br/>
...but be forewarned that its my first website and I am just learning <br/>
HTML and how to "work it" so its under construction.<br/>
<br/>
   Do you have other hobbies besides letterboxing? "Yes,Virginia" <br/>
there are OTHER things besides letterboxing, despite the fact that it <br/>
has been in my dreams recently!  Let us know about your hobbies...I <br/>
know that a while ago a "Hobby Ring" was going around, or may still <br/>
be...but at least we can discover more about one another through <br/>
emails.<br/>
<br/>
   I also write poetry and short stories, and you can check out my <br/>
website set up for others to post on as well at:<br/>
<br/>

If you go to this site and want to reply or add your own posts, you <br/>

<br/>
Just like that, with caps and spaces or it will not work. Let us know <br/>
what your hobbies are, and your websites if you'd like to share <br/>
them!  And please post photos if you feel comfortable doing so.  I <br/>
would love to see them, and others might as well!<br/>

Avast!  Another pirate of the letterbox!  I'm Dagonell the Pirate of<br/>
Otter's Cove.  Okay, you pillage the Western Sea, I'll pillage the<br/>
Eastern Sea, and whoever gets to the Mississippi first gets first<br/>
pillage.  Disputes to be settled by flintlocks at 30 paces! <br/>
<br/>
I've posted pictures of me in the album "More Pirates!".  The first<br/>
was taken at the premiere of "Pirates of the Carribean"  First time<br/>
I've ever gotten a standing ovation just for walking into a movie<br/>
theatre.  The second is a posed shot.  And I've served on board a<br/>
*real* pirate ship before she sank, the HMS Sealion.  More info about<br/>
her, here!<br/>

Hello, Dagonell the Pirate!  I see you are around Chatauqua (forgive <br/>
spelling)  I used to live in Corry, PA and I was around that Lake a few <br/>
times.  I espcially liked the Book Barn :)<br/>
<br/>
I'm now back home in WV (hubby was in Corry when we married, so that's <br/>
how I got transplanted -- but I eventually drug him back to WV with <br/>
me ;)<br/>
