(what's one more message (perhaps the final one) in a morass of, well, I <br/>
dunno ...)<br/>
<br/>
Jeremy is right.  The list is getting big.  That doesn't necessarily mean<br/>
that it can't return to the community feel its had for the past 4 years <br/>
(I mean, the small town I'm from had more 700 people or whatever we're at <br/>
and kept its community feel, but it is clear that towns with 7,000,000 people <br/>
lose that somewhere along the line).<br/>
<br/>
Many lists, when they reach a certain size, become moderated.  For example,<br/>
I don't think bugtraq, which has some 40,000 members, could function if it<br/>
were not moderated.  (Bugtrag, tho, also proves that a list with 40,000 people<br/>
can work, (tho the moderators use real list management tools and draw a <br/>
salary for their work ...))<br/>
<br/>
Those of you who know me, though, know that I don't want to moderate the list.<br/>
But, I am going to float a couple issues via poll.  They are --<br/>
<br/>
* should the initiator (and all his aliases that exist and as they come<br/>
up) of msg 14484 (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/message/14484 ; <br/>
subject "Newbies make me want to vomit!") be banned from the list?  (Since the<br/>
initiator didn't take too many pains to hide his identity, one may want <br/>
to consider this fact, and previous conduct (if any) of the initiator on the <br/>
list).<br/>
<br/>
(Perhaps as an alternative, the initiator should disclose his identity and<br/>
apologise to the community?)<br/>
<br/>
* should the list settings be changed to moderate a new subscriber's first<br/>
post?  (This would have the effect of controlling a certain class of spam<br/>
(presently with low volume), and people who like to create hotmail accounts to<br/>
get around moderation, and probably the "vomit" post, but would also have the <br/>
possible effect of making the list feel even more members-only, and would <br/>
dramatically increase the workload of the volunteers, and could possibly <br/>
eliminate game-related actions, if the moderator makes a mistake)<br/>
<br/>
I guess I could have made a decision on these issues without telling anyone,<br/>
and some (most) people may have preferred that.  But, we've always tried to <br/>
talk about things around here.  Its my way of trying to be a community <br/>
rather than just a list.  Perhaps this is a dinosaur notion now, I dunno.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the poll results will only serve as advice, not a mandate ...<br/>
<br/>
Some other points --<br/>
<br/>
* Blame the off-topic posts on me.  The list charter (in the trailer of every <br/>
message: http://www.letterboxing.org/list.html), explicitly allows this.<br/>
Quoting in part: "The group is loose and easy going; related off-topic ok <br/>
within reason".  I guess that's the way most people have always wanted it<br/>
and I figured people could handle it like, well, people in a face to face<br/>
setting.  We've always figured that people's common sense could define <br/>
"within reason", which includes, btw, the right to opine (civilly) that <br/>
altoids, purple socks, geocaching, and benchmarking are off-topic and not <br/>
within reason, and the right to opine that they are.   But like the old <br/>
quote about jazz, if I have to explain it, you won't get it anyway.  <br/>
Sheesh ... the key word is "reasonable".  I like to think of it as a <br/>
gathering at a park -- there ain't no moderator there, there is no reason <br/>
there needs to be one here ... but also keep in mind that no 5 year old <br/>
on the planet has developed the social skills necessary to undertand this <br/>
message, nor to understand RFC 1855, which "offically" defines the etiquette <br/>
of the list, so adult supervision may or may not be appropriate ... YMMV<br/>
<br/>
* In response to a recent post about me "banning" someone (who shall remain<br/>
anonymous):  First, they were moderated, not banned.  Secondly, it was for <br/>
being uncivil, not for being blunt or the nature of the opinion.  I don't<br/>
care to dumpster-dive the message in question, but you can if you want to.<br/>
This was also after one warning.  At the time, 18 people sent me notes <br/>
agreeing with my decision, with one sending me a note disagreeing.  The <br/>
point is not that I did the right thing, but that no matter what I did, <br/>
someone would disagree with my decision.  That's the way it goes ... I <br/>
truly do try to me neutral in running the list,  including doing things I <br/>
don't want to, such as banning non-member posts as we have recently (I <br/>
guess its a slippery slope ... and I'm sure some are disagreeing with <br/>
the way I'm handling this ... fortunately I am desensitized to it ...).<br/>
<br/>
* Remember, we're all newbies.  Some in Dartmoor cringe when they hear<br/>
the phrase "North American letterboxing" ...<br/>
<br/>
* A recent poster had some excellent suggestions on avoiding flames.  <br/>
<br/>
* Ignore trolls.  I'm the list manager, so I can't, but no one else has<br/>
any excuse to respond to a troll.  Remember, trolls want you to respond.<br/>
Trolls can't survive being ignored, and it torments them after they post<br/>
and as they try to sleep if you ignore them ...<br/>
<br/>
* And finally, a note on the first amendment ("freedom of speech").  It is<br/>
a misconception that the first amendment has much to do with people's rights<br/>
to post their opinions on this list.  The first amendment protects <br/>
citizens of the US from having their speech censored by the _government_.<br/>
It gives you no protection from Yahoo!, the moderators of this list censoring<br/>
it, nor does it give you protection from others flaming you for your post<br/>
or asking you not to make similar posts.  I've always wanted to write<br/>
this paragraph, so here I am ... just don't invoke the first amendment if <br/>
you say something controversial or rude, and get flamed or disagreed with ...<br/>
<br/>
* Feel free to post your opinions about this on (or off) list, but be <br/>
sensitive to the people who feel it is not "related on-topic" ...<br/>
<br/>
I don't have time for this ... and most of me would enjoy letting chaos<br/>
run its course ... but someone (again) suggested I do something ...<br/>
<br/>

I'll throw out my $.02 worth on this one.  If you're going to request that<br/>
the initiator of message 14484 disclose his/her identity to the community,<br/>
then perhaps you should require that a certain "5-year old" do the same.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I'm inclined to just let the whole thing die...  My e-mail<br/>
'kill-list' does a fine job of keeping lizards and other unsavory things out<br/>
of my InBox ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for doing one of those thankless jobs !!<br/>

Some of you have noticed that trolls are sending off-topic content<br/>
to the list and the upload sections.  This stuff is obviously outside<br/>
the charter of the family-oriented hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Don't feed the trolls -- many use automated systems and will not<br/>
see your reply anyway.  For the most part, people have been good<br/>
about this.<br/>
<br/>
I've temporarily banned attachments.  I'll unban them sometime in<br/>
the future.  In the mean time, if you have letterboxing-related<br/>
attachments, please put them in the "files" or "photos" section<br/>
(this is the right thing to do anyway, but otherwise there are <br/>
legitimate reasons for attachments to be part of the game).  Note<br/>
that trolls will also be putting their stuff there, so if you are<br/>
easily bothered, check that the person who created the folder or<br/>
file or e-mail message is someone you recognize from the list before<br/>
opening it, and not imatroll_somenumbers_or_letters@yahoo.com <br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that it can take up to 2 days for settings changes and<br/>
other moderator action to take effect on the group, and that the<br/>
moderators can't monitor the goings on here 24 hours a day.  I in<br/>
fact check photos and files once every month or so, so if there is<br/>
something off-topic up there, you have to send me a note.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your understanding.  Comments, questions, and opposing<br/>
points of view are best handled off-list to the moderaters.<br/>
