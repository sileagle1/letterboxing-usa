<br/>
Actually, I've hiked almost 850 miles now.  I'm in Waynesboro, but <br/>
I've only writen my adventures up through Pearisburg so far, which is <br/>
620 miles.  I've still got lots more stories to tell!  Hopefully <br/>
within the next couple of weeks I'll finally get caught up again.<br/>
