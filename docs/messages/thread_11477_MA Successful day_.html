                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you so much for your nice compliment about the Marconi stamp. I <br/>
am not exactly an expert carver (far from it) so I appreciate any <br/>
kind words. Are there many stamp-ins in that box? My husband &amp; I are <br/>
planning a Cape getaway in a couple weeks and we look forward to <br/>
doing some 'boxing while we're there.<br/>
