<br/>
Hammonasset River &amp; Chatfield Hollow (Witches Trail) are on the <br/>
Western CT list. The CT River is the dividing landmark. <br/>
However, Seven Falls, Bear Hill, Turtle Creek and Cheap Date, which <br/>
are on the Eastern list, are actually west of the river too, though <br/>
just barely.<br/>
<br/>
Bruce and I were out today scouting for new hiding places, and should <br/>
have some clues to post tomorrow. We had a blast at Hartman Park <br/>
yesterday with the gang, and we can tell from Jay's "Happiness" that <br/>
he is truly a demented individual...but we won't elaborate about that <br/>
here...better for each to see for his/herself.<br/>
<br/>
The polling for the Spring Gathering weekend closes tomorrow night. If <br/>
anyone has a preference who hasn't voted, better cast your vote now. <br/>
This is regarding the Gathering planned for Sleeping Giant in Hamden, <br/>
CT.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails,<br/>
