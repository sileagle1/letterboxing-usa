Planted: 9/15/02<br/>
<br/>
Location:  Outside of Kalispell, MT.<br/>
<br/>
To reach the Park:<br/>
Drive Northeast on Highway 2 approximately 25 miles.  There will be a <br/>
fee to enter the park.<br/>
To reach the Hike:<br/>
Drive on the Going to the Sun Road to the trailhead for St. Mary <br/>
Falls and Virginia Falls. The hike is approximately 1.5 miles to <br/>
Virginia Falls.<br/>
To Reach the Letterbox:<br/>
Hike past St. Mary Falls toward Virginia Falls. Cross a footbridge <br/>
and continue up a rocky ledge, then back into forest. As the trail <br/>
curves away from the stream again look for a snag on your left.  From <br/>
the snag take 6 steps to a stump on your left.  Behind the stump and <br/>
under the fallen tree trunk is the Moon River Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Please be very very DISCREET when looking for this box and when <br/>
stamping in!<br/>
Read the waiver of responsibility and liability.<br/>
Thank You,<br/>
Amanda from Seattle<br/>
