I have many plans and hopefully I will have a chance to carve and plant <br/>
most of them.  So far mine have only been personal interests, but I <br/>
think MrOspital and I are going to base some of the ideas on the <br/>
locations we plan on using, give the LB a reason for being there.  <br/>

<br/>
I check out topos prior to going into an area. Many times I find local <br/>
names for areas, mountains, rivers ,etc. In our area there is a <br/>
mountain called Elephant Knob, obviously that called for a box called <br/>
Pachyderm Point and stamp to match. Sometimes the image is a twist on <br/>
the name and isn't what one would expect.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I carve on the spot, when an idea hits me. I think those can <br/>
be some of the best carvings.<br/>
<br/>
You didn't ask for images but you might want to put this site in your <br/>
favorites.<br/>

<br/>
Nah, not any more, too many have gone missing to sweat it. Life is too <br/>
short to get your knickers in a twist over something you have no <br/>
control over. It used to bother me, but I've found I'm happier if I let <br/>
it go once it is planted.<br/>
This is another reason we delete old missing box clue sheets rather <br/>
than archiving them. Just let it go and say bye-bye.<br/>
