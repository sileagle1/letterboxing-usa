No, I am afraid that I have not been able to get out that way to replace it.<br/>
If anyone is heading over and would be willing to deliver the stamp to its<br/>

My sister and I and our kids visited the box on Sunday anyway.  <br/>
Other than the missing stamp and missing ink pad, it's in good <br/>
condition.  LOTS of people have been there, despite the missing <br/>
stamp.  I drew a covered bridge in my logbook and my sister's so we <br/>
could have something to show we'd been there  :)<br/>
I'm not sure where you are, but I live in northeastern CT and if you <br/>
want to meet somewhere this week, I could bring the stamp to the box <br/>
this weekend.  Email me if you're interested - <br/>
