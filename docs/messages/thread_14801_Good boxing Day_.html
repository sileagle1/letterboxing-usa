but haven't been able to post them on the website yet.  I tried, but <br/>
it wouldn't go through, and then I lost everything I'd typed!  Don't <br/>
you just love modern technology!  <br/>
My husband and I like to combine letterboxing with our main hobby - <br/>
motorcycling.  So many scenic places to ride to!  Yesterday, we <br/>
braved the threat of rain to ride up to Cunningham Falls to search <br/>
for the Loonerism Betterspox and plant one of our own.  The hike to <br/>
Loonerism was very nice, although hot and very muggy.  With the dark <br/>
gray clouds overhead, the trail was very eery, like something out of <br/>
a fantasy novel.  One section of the trail has steep hills on either <br/>
side, and you could just imagine it was the sort of place to be set <br/>
upon by highwaymen!  Unfortunately, no Loonerism Betterspox!  We <br/>
found the spot, I'm sure, even some nicely placed rocks at the foot <br/>
of the tree, but alas, no box!  So we headed back up to the falls <br/>
area to spy a good spot for our box to hide.  As it was about 6:30 <br/>
p.m. when we reached the parking area for the trails, the cliff trail <br/>
was deserted.  The woods were dimly lit and all was quiet.  Walking <br/>
up the trail we suddenly spied a small herd of deer staring at us, <br/>
not far from the trail.  As we walked on, we kept seeing more and <br/>
more, just standing there staring at us.  It was almost spooky the <br/>
way they stared!  While hiding the box, we saw two baby deer laying <br/>
in the underbrush, just watching us.  We also had a fox pick his way <br/>
up the hill, not even 10 yards away from us!  We sat there so <br/>
quietly, I don't know if he saw us or not.  We were almost spotted by <br/>
hikers as we were working on hiding the box, and had to act like we <br/>
were just hanging out.  I'm sure we looked suspicious!  Hopefully, <br/>
our box will be safe and not disappear like so many others.  Finally, <br/>
the box was hidden and rain was starting to fall.  It was also <br/>
getting dark, so we didn't get to finish our hike down to the falls, <br/>
but riding home in the rain was totally worth it!  We already have <br/>
ideas for our second box!<br/>
