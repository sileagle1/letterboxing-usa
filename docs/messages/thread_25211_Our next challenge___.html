                    <div class="plaintext-content">... will be trying to find a few boxes in Finland.  I found a Finnish website that lists several clues, including 2 series in National Parks (hosted by the parks).  The challenge will be to figure out the clues!  Google translation of Finnish to English is only so-so and the clues are actually clues, rather than directions, so a little bit cryptic.  In addition, some of the boxes were planted back in 2001. Plant dates range from 2001-2009, but of the 50 or so that we are aware of in southern Finland, only 5 were planted last year, so most are older.<br/>
<br/>
Wish us luck with the Finnish "lodjua"!<br/>
