I stopped reading messages on this list over a year ago and only began<br/>
reading them again during the last few months.... but then I stopped<br/>
again because 1. There is no clear order, 2. There is a feeling of<br/>
"unwelcome" here.<br/>
<br/>
www.lbworld.org kicked butt, however.  No one was ever made to feel<br/>
unwelcomed.  I don't know what Steve did that was so wrong, but I<br/>
never read a post of his on lbworld that wasn't helpful and NICE!  Not<br/>
only that, but the forum was IMMENSELY resourceful for new and old and<br/>
eliminated the need for "cross posting".  That site was a work of art.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, instantly wondered if it had been intentionally brought down.<br/>
 In my heart I am still inclined to believe that it was.  As for<br/>
proof, this isn't a court of law.  We aren't threatening legal action.<br/>
 We, rather, I am simply saying that I am uneasy with believing it was<br/>
a freak accident.<br/>
<br/>
As for backing things up... I'll take nice and naive over a rude<br/>
dictatorship any day.  Actually, I'd make that choice no matter how<br/>
many times I had to create a new log in and repost my clues.  <br/>
<br/>
This is just a tiny piece of the world, a sliver of a sliver.  Instead<br/>
of worrying about controlling people's thoughts, ideas, and words...<br/>
why not make this little sliver of "yours" a place that inspires GOOD<br/>
things?  Try it and see if you can because I've almost lost hope in<br/>
it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Seems like it would have been better to just make sure the LbNA<br/>
&gt; &gt; site was better than his, rather than to moderate him and ban any<br/>
&gt; &gt; messages that mentioned his site.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; His messages were moderated for more than just mentioning his<br/>
website <br/>
&gt; excessively.  I started moderating him on the Pacific Northwest<br/>
board <br/>
&gt; for excessive cross-posting--even AFTER I e-mailed him privately <br/>
&gt; asking him to stop.<br/>
