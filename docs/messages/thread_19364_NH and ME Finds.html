reunion.  Managed to find 10 boxes as well.<br/>
<br/>
Field of Dreams Letterbox - Salem, NH - letterbox is in a ziplock <br/>
bag and very wet.  Great place to stop if traveling north and have <br/>
the kids play.  What a playscape!!! Had to pry my kids from it. <br/>
<br/>
Pemi Trail Letterbox - Franconia, NH - all is well.<br/>
<br/>
Cathedral Ledge Letterbox Series - North Conway, NH - managed to <br/>
collect all 3 stamps.  Very nice!<br/>
<br/>
Diana's Baths Letterbox - North Conway, NH - Cute stamp. Left my <br/>
water shoes up the path a ways while I went and stamped.  When I <br/>
camp back one was gone.  Kids loved playing in the waterfalls here.  <br/>
If anyone ever finds an aqua blue water shoe - it's MINE!!!<br/>
<br/>
Elephant Head letterbox - Bartlett, NH (Crawford Notch)- Great <br/>
scenery.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Hiker letterbox - Wildcat Mountain, Pinkham Notch, NH - Cute <br/>
stamp!  We took the easy way up the mountain (the tram)<br/>
<br/>
Wildcat Mountain letterbox - Pinkham Notch, NH - Great shape<br/>
<br/>
Rumford Letterbox - Rumford, ME - Easy to find.  Great shape. Had to <br/>
do this one as it was where the family reunion was. <br/>
<br/>
We attempted the Eastern Slopes Inn Riverwalk Letterbox.  After <br/>
searching for over an hour for what we believed to be a rather easy <br/>
find, we gave up.  THere was an update about a month back that <br/>
someone had found it though.<br/>
<br/>
We also attempted the Thompson's Wildcat Falls Letterbox.  But the <br/>
kids were just too tired so we turned back.  <br/>
<br/>
Dropped off the Duffer HH along the way.  It was time he got out of <br/>
CT.  <br/>
<br/>
I was the originator of the "reluctant husbands" thread that was <br/>
going around a week or so ago.  He did drive me to all but one <br/>
letterbox and hiked a few short ones with me.  The kids were the <br/>
same - if they saw something else that was more interesting, they <br/>
didn't bother to come with me.  All in all - a great time and <br/>
beautiful weather. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the help in planning some of my searches for quick <br/>
boxes along the way. <br/>
