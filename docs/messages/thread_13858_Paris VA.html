                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a lovely hike in Sky Meadows park on Wednesday June 25.  It <br/>
was a long afternoon.  We managed to hike all but 3 of the trails in <br/>
the park and on the way found all of the boxes.  All of the boxes <br/>
were in good shape.  We found all of The Sarah Special: A Triple <br/>
Sized Feast of Fancy boxes in the open and rehid them way better <br/>
then we found them. We saw lots of wildlife.  It was a great day to <br/>
take off and head to the woods.  <br/>
