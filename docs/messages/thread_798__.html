&gt; Well, just found out today about the online chat, so needless to say, I<br/>
missed<br/>
&gt; it.  Just wondering what you guys came up with?  I noticed that for the<br/>
poll,<br/>
&gt; the only two available weekends to choose from, I already posted that I<br/>
&gt; wouldn't be able to make.  Just let me know if you wind up picking a<br/>
different<br/>
&gt; weekend, so I'll be there again to beat Randy to a couple of boxes :)<br/>

Dear Kim,<br/>

The second poll that Rob posted has May 13-14 as a possibility. How's <br/>
that work for you?<br/>

Glad to hear that second May week-end could work for you. How  does <br/>
the rest of the goup feel now? The poll indicates most people prefer <br/>
the spring to the summer. Do we want to settle on May 13-14? Who <br/>
could not make it that week-end?<br/>
