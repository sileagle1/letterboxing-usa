<div>Start at the location of the craft that came from 
the home of Letterboxing. Look for the sign of ghosts and legends.At a railing 
look between the Scorpian and Mary's nose at 310 degrees, past the span in the 
distance ( it could be blue at night ) the Chancellor could walk in this park.It 
is too far to swim and best to drive to the goldenshore south of ocean. Park 
where the metermaids patrol.Walk along goldenshore south to the point.Look to 
your right for Pelicans,Herons,Seagulls and other shorebirds.At the point take 
10 concrete steps down,then head north 15 paces to a palmtree.The black round 
box is hidden under a sloped slab rock on the west side of the palmtree covered 
by some movable rocks.</div>
<div> <span id="__#Ath#SignaturePos__"></span> Note: There is 30 minutes 
free parking at the start .That should be sufficient time ,but in case it isn't 
, combine this search with a tour or a meal and get validation for parking.When 
you near the box cover your quest by carrying a trash bag and by all means help 
out the wetlands by picking some up.</div></body></html>
