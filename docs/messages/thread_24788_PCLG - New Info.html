                    <div class="plaintext-content">After many e-mails that stretch back well over a year; Brian of PCLG<br/>
recently offered to let me adopt all of the PCLG boxes. As many know,<br/>
PCLG developed some great clues but as a whole has been out of boxing<br/>
for awhile. Brian has basically been 'holding the keys to the store'.<br/>
His offer to me was a great gesture that I was glad to accept. I will<br/>
shortly start to update the clues on LBNA of the boxes that are known<br/>
to remain and will be reviewing the missing boxes to see which ones I<br/>
may revive. A couple of long time boxers have previouly 'adopted' some<br/>
PCLG clues to keep them alive. I will be reaching out to them, but just<br/>
so it is clear; I have no intention of asking anyone to 'give up' their<br/>
adopted boxes. You went through the trouble of keeping them alive and<br/>
Brian appreciated the effort-and I certainly do as well. I'm glad that<br/>
others felt the same desire to keep them alive that I do. I would like<br/>
to hear from anyone who has found PCLG boxes that are listed as<br/>
missing. I've heard that some boxers have found remnants of 'missing'<br/>
boxes (like I have) and if there is anything worthwhile left to look<br/>
at, I would like to see them if possible. I look forward to keeping the<br/>
legacy of these boxes alive and as such, any boxes that I maintain will<br/>
reference their PCLG history. -John    (Also posted to LBMA board)<br/>
