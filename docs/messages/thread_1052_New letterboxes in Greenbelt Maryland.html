Here are clues to two new boxes in Greenbelt Maryland. Please post these on the map, as well as the Washington Monument and Yankauer Boxes. Thanks.<br/>
I should have them on the website soon. Go to <br/>
http://hometown.aol.com/twograysquirrels/page1.html for the Greenbelt Clues<br/>
or <br/>
print these out<br/>

 First Greenbelt Park Letterbox Clues<br/>
 Greenbelt, Maryland<br/>
<br/>
 From the Beltway (Route 495), take the exit for Route 201/Kenilworth<br/>
 Avenue south. After exiting, bear to the right and follow signs to<br/>
 Greenbelt Rd./Route 193 east. Even as you bear to the right, stay in one<br/>
 of the two left hand lanes so that you can turn to Greenbelt Road<br/>
 heading east. Once on Greenbelt Road, youll cross over Kenilworth<br/>
 Avenue and continue until you see a sign for the entrance to the park.<br/>
 Once inside the park, make a right at the first stop sign, then take the<br/>
 first left into the parking area for the Sweet Gum Picnic Area.<br/>
<br/>
 From the parking lot take the Azalea nature Tail. At that entrance you<br/>
 might see some Indian Pipe Stem under the trees to the left of the<br/>
 trailhead.<br/>
<br/>
 Walk down the trail a little where you can spend a few minutes<br/>
 stretching your legs before you proceed.<br/>
<br/>
 At the log square on the right look around you might see some nice<br/>
 mushrooms. This park has lots of interesting mushrooms. Do not eat any.<br/>
 I only recommend looking at them<br/>
<br/>
 Continue on along the creek until you cross a wood bridge. Immediately<br/>
 after crossing take the first unmarked trail to the right. The first<br/>
 Greenbelt letterbox is behind the first big tree you see on the right.<br/>
 Be sure to cover it back up with some rocks so the creek doesnt take<br/>
 it.<br/>
<br/>
 If you are in a hurry go back the way you came to find the Oak Leaf<br/>
 Letterbox. If not I would suggest following the trails around and hide a<br/>
 box of your own and look for some mushrooms and other wildlife. I saw<br/>
 some skinks, damselflies and a hawk while I was there. Here is a partial<br/>
 list of mushrooms I found:<br/>
<br/>
 Witched Butter (Tremella mesenterica)<br/>
 Short-stalked White Russula (Russula brevipes)<br/>
 Sulpher shelf (Laetiporus sulphureus)<br/>
 Oyster Mushrroms<br/>
 False Turkey-tail<br/>
 Pig Skin Poison Puffballs<br/>
 Ling Chih<br/>
 Dye Polypore<br/>

 Oak Leaf Letterbox Clues<br/>
 Greenbelt Park, Maryland<br/>
 Greenbelt, Maryland<br/>
<br/>
 From the Azalea Nature Trail take the fit trail. Continue past the<br/>
 Robinson tree. Proceed to the RG tree and walk into the woods past the<br/>
 RG tree about 38 paces to the twin trees. The letterbox is behind those<br/>
 trees at the base.<br/>
<br/>
 Continue on up the hill to the field and the parking lot on the left.<br/>
