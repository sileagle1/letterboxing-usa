Amy and I are planning a trip to DC for this box, please anyone that <br/>
can give us a SitRep on it?  We are planning to head down March 2-<br/>
4/5.  All help would be great.  Thanks<br/>

had no luck with the smithsonian box. did see the<br/>
great swath of velcro, but no box. left to get the<br/>
ram, wandered around looking for the numbers, sat and<br/>
waited 10 minutes for people to leave the area,  took<br/>
it with us for coffee, went back and waited a good<br/>
half hour for people to leave to relpace it (myself<br/>
and my friend are vertically challenged) and buzzed<br/>
back to the castle and still found nothing. it is<br/>
quite possible that we missed it twice, we were away<br/>
for at least an hour, (saturday midday) but<br/>
disenheartening none the less. the guard started<br/>
staring at us, so we moved on to explorer, orion, and<br/>
independance with more sucess. (following the<br/>
footprints in the snow makes boxing somewhat less<br/>
challenging, i must say...)<br/>
independence looked like it had previously been wet,<br/>
but the book was ok, so we shoved it in a zip-loc and<br/>
shoved it back into the grass. <br/>
was bitterly cold with the wind, and the snow wasnt<br/>
nearly as bad as the rivers of melting run-off, but it<br/>
was a good day overall.  what is the recall date on<br/>
the castle box- assuming it is still there?<br/>
good luck to all<br/>
spike-<br/>
<br/>
ps- to make it easier to identify me, should we pass<br/>
while boxing, for an exchange or such,i am female and<br/>
currently quite pregnant!<br/>

                    <html><body>I'm wondering if the guard figured out something was going on.  He was practically staring at that handicapped door and the water fountain the whole time I was there.  He also had a second security guard there and they were constantly checking out the corner.  The only way I got it back into the velcro was by taking a sip of water, and at the same time, taking my left hand with the film canister and slipping it back into the velcro.  
<br/>
<br/>I wonder if there were SO many people feeling around that water fountain on his particular watches, that he caught on eventually that the box was there.  In this case, I think the curator should have notified ONLY the security guards that the box was there.
<br/>
<br/>Just my thoughts...
