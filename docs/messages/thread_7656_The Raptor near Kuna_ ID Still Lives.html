I wanted to let you all know that the Raptor Letterbox<br/>
near Kuna, ID is alive.  When I stamped in today the<br/>
last folks to have been there were 7 Sep 01...a long<br/>
time ago.   I guess everyone will have to start coming<br/>
to Idaho to visit and plant some more boxes and find<br/>
the few we have so far.  Are there any other<br/>
Letterboxers out there who live in Idaho?  I'm trying<br/>
to place some more, but it'd be more fun if others<br/>
joined in. =-)  <br/>
<br/>
If you do go to the one in Kuna I recommend you bring<br/>
a glove or long sleeve shirt.  I was pretty freaked<br/>
out reaching in for it.  I think the local prairie<br/>
dogs/rabbits played with it some.  =-)  I even saw a<br/>
Prairie Falcon flying by after I stamped in.  Neat-O!!<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail.<br/>
