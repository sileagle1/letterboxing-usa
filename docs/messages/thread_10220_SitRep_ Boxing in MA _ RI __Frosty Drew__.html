Hello Janet,<br/>
Clues for "A Tree For All Seasons" are listed on the map under <br/>
Eastern Ma . Its in the town of Dover in Norfolk County. Its a Great <br/>
idea of LoneMassWolfs. The stamp changes seasonally and will be <br/>
retired after the summer. You have already missed fall but winter is <br/>
there now.<br/>

Did you get youre name "Moonstone" from the beach in Charlestown ?<br/>

Is it alright to ask if it was where we thought? Amongst one of the <br/>
cement things with the poles sticking up ?<br/>

thanks for the info.  I will have to get out to this tree to get the <br/>

it is in Charlestown]<br/>

Hi Janet! That was one we planted for the Mystery Gathering, and the <br/>
clues are at<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/message/17429<br/>
<br/>
It's still there but we plan on re-clue-ing it with a pair of new <br/>
boxes we're working on. The whole "pole shift" thing got boring so <br/>
we're making it into a CS Lewis series. Have fun with it!<br/>
