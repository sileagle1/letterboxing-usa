No problem, Funhog, now that I know what your wishes are.  There are <br/>
only two letterboxes of yours in my neck of the woods, and I haven't <br/>
found either of them yet (I haven't searched, yet, either - just to <br/>
clarify).<br/>

I want our boxes to be found , I work hard on these  stamps , I want <br/>
people to see them . <br/>
If you are monitoring the list and pick up a piece of info from the  <br/>
chatter , then more power to you . If you go back and research the <br/>
list for  info,then good for you . It's having the info  stored in <br/>
one place for anyone to access or enter that bugs me . The only good <br/>
thing  about the database on the newage site is that it's become too <br/>
large to be  manageable . I used to go through it to see if our boxes <br/>
are being listed ( a  few are ) but now it takes so long , I don't <br/>
bother any more . If I remember  right, a poll was taken when  the <br/>
database was first introduced on this site . I believe the results of <br/>
that  poll showed that the majority of people opposed the  idea of a <br/>
database . <br/>
I know that some  of the more active and long time box creators are <br/>
very much opposed to the  idea . I have much respect for these people <br/>
and can almost sum up my feelings  by saying " if Jay Drew is against <br/>
it , then I'm against it " . I figure the  truth is that if someone <br/>
likes the idea of a databaseand they have the  tools needed to <br/>
create it , then they feel they should make it and the  feelings of <br/>
others , who have created the boxes " be damned " .<br/>

<br/>
I agree with Funhog about listing the status of boxes on a database.<br/>
I enjoy creating boxes and finding interesting spots in which to hide <br/>
them.  They are my very meager offerings.  I try to keep them in good <br/>
condition.  When a box is posted into a database by anyone else but <br/>
me, it strips me of my feeling of ownership (WC) of the box.  I have <br/>
my own ideas of what my box should be and resent that creativity <br/>
being stripped from my control.  I especially abhor the comments <br/>
field in the database.  All comments are subjective, therefore <br/>
judgemental.  Judgement = criticism, even if you think you are being <br/>
nice (think teenagers).  Remember that I am an amateur artist and <br/>
letterboxer.  The compensation I receive is the pleasure I get from <br/>
hearing from finders, especially directly, but also on list. <br/>
<br/>
I read alot of posts that say "I don't understand why so-and-so <br/>
doesn't want this done MY WAY".  My answer to this is YOU don't need <br/>
to understand, simply respect.  I really think it is time to start <br/>
respecting the creativity and generosity of the letterbox placers.   <br/>

to take a moment to read what all the hubbub is about. To my suprise, <br/>
I found that several of my boxes are reported on there (in the New <br/>
Age DB). For the most part, I am not offended by this. If people are <br/>
interested enough in my boxes to want to report their success in <br/>
finding them or let others know whether the locations are appropriate <br/>
for kids, so be it.<br/>
<br/>
<begin rant=""><br/>
<br/>
But then I read the comment for "State of Maine", and discovered that <br/>
the box has been reduced to "quick and easy at reststop". Now I'm not <br/>
claiming that it takes a rocket scientist to determine that "State of <br/>
Maine" is located at a rest stop, but frankly the clue that I devised <br/>
does not explicitly say that the box is at a rest stop. If the <br/>
purpose of the database is to provide information that is incidental <br/>
to decyphering the clue, fine. But if the end result is the watering <br/>
down of clues, I have to object. <br/>
<br/>
To be fair to the database camp, the first of the three rules listed <br/>
on the group's home page seems to suggest that this sort of behavior <br/>
is not desired - specifically:<br/>
<br/>
1. Don't give hints to clues unless someone is really stuck and can't <br/>
get ahold of the placer for a hint.<br/>
<br/>
But it appears that this rule is not strictly adhered to by all <br/>
database participants.<br/>

enough reason to dump the database idea, even if someone personally <br/>

Then to take a bad idea to another letterboxing board where <br/>

Anyhow, it's kind of pointless when the database is full of <br/>
misinformation.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, Funhog!<br/>
<br/>
I have read a lot of replies to this post.  I can see people's points and counterpoints.  Surely, I can respect your wishes, and anyone else's concerning yours/their respective boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
My little problem is that I can't even remember where I put my keys on any given day.  ;-)  I seldom post about a box other than in reply to a question, and just give my experience or opinion.  I try not to spoil anyone's fun.  However, because this is such a touchy subject with some people, I rarely post a thing here, and hardly even read the LbNA database because I could never remember who has requested their boxes be (or not be) posted about or refered to, and under what conditions, and where it's okay, and what constitutes "too much info" in anyone's opinion...   <br/>
<br/>
So, I would just like to make a suggestion that all placers who feel anything pro or con about public posts make note of their feelings on the clues and in the box.  Then people like me are likely to remember the placer's wishes or can easily check the clues again before posting.  I have one set of clues that clearly states:  THIS BOX IS NOT TO BE REFERRED TO IN ANY WAY ON ANY TALKLIST, TALKLIST DATABASE OR WEBSITE WITHOUT PERMISSION OF THE OWNER.  <br/>
Good thing!  Then I really have no excuse for posting a status update or asking questions to this list.  <br/>
<br/>
I honestly can't say that I'd remember anyone's wishes from what I've read here on the list, no matter how many threads and posts cover this issue.  Please put your wishes on your clues and in your boxes so I won't be a dunce and piss you off.  I wouldn't do so out of disrespect or disregard.  Just please be crystal clear and say if discussing your boxes on this list is okay,  or if only private emails are okay, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
Mary (RI)<br/>

  Subject: [LbNA] database phobic<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Please, please, please don't enter any of my boxes in any <br/>
  database. I may be a dinosaur but I really don't want  the status <br/>
  of my boxes listed anywhere except on the LbNA site. I try to keep <br/>
  current on them and love to hear updates from those who search <br/>
  for them. Keep me posted, you all!<br/>
<br/>
  Unfortunately, I have found seven of my boxes listed on the <br/>
  NewAge site and have been unable to get them removed even <br/>
  with direct requests. If you are responsible for these entries, <br/>
  please do your best to have them removed for me.  Alternatively,  <br/>
  I am considering pulling these boxes. <br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for the help, Funhog<br/>

&gt; Does it matter why people feel so passionate about it, one way or <br/>

I don't have too much time to get out and letterbox, so when I do, I <br/>
like to have a pretty good chance of success.  Or at least know that <br/>
the box is there, and I'm not completely wasting my time.  I joined <br/>
the group known as "New Age Letterboxing" because I like the idea of <br/>
a database, even though many of the people here seem not to.  I wish <br/>
more boxes were in it.  It is helpful.  You don't have to use it.  <br/>
Let those of us who like it to letterbox in peace.  If you don't like <br/>
the idea, you don't have to use it.  Intentionally poisoning someone <br/>
elses hard work and other peoples fun is just mean and stupid.  <br/>

Sorry you feel that way.  It is mean, I suppose, although I don't <br/>
think it's so stupid.  I do not approve boxes being on that list <br/>
without the owner's permission and am trying to kill the database.  <br/>
Reasoning hasn't worked, but perhaps poisoning it with false <br/>
information will.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm not even opposed to a database in principle--it's the fact <br/>
that boxes are being added without the owner's consent that I don't <br/>
like.  It's mean and stupid for the database owner to allow boxes be <br/>
included without the box owner's permission.<br/>
<br/>
And you know, I'm sure a lot of people WOULD approve of their boxes <br/>
being listed in the database.  You know--catching more flies with <br/>
honey than vinegar.  If they would just ask the owners before adding <br/>
a box, it would be a happy, florishing database that I wouldn't mess <br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
And--this might really surprise you--I wouldn't even care if MY boxes <br/>
were included (minus the mystery boxes--I don't want those in the <br/>
database, but only a small minority of my boxes are mysteries).  <br/>
Shocking, I know, but it's the principle of the thing.  While I don't <br/>
care if most of my boxes are in the database, I think it's morally <br/>
reprehensible that the owners of the box aren't allowed to have a say <br/>
on it.<br/>
<br/>
Think of it as civil disobedience.  =)  I think the database--as it <br/>
now stands--is morally reprehensible and it's the responsibilty of <br/>
upstanding citizens such as myself (*clearing throat*) to change it--<br/>
or, if that's impossible, destroy it by destroying its credibility.<br/>
