                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually, Connecticut's closing their "package stores" at 8 pm has nothing <br/>
to do with the Blue Laws. It has everything to do with some crazy murderer <br/>
back in the late 50's, who robbed and then killed package store owners at <br/>
night, in the New Britain area. The guy was caught and given life, but the <br/>
State decided it would be safer to close the package stores at 8 pm. Sorry <br/>
for the off-topic nature of this post.<br/>

&gt;These laws are prohibitive "Blue Laws", as<br/>
&gt;alcohol can't be bought in Connecticut after 8 p.m. or<br/>
&gt;on Sundays, hunting cannot be performed on Sundays,<br/>
&gt;the only thing permitted, even up untill the 70's in<br/>
&gt;connecticut, was the attendance of church. I can<br/>
&gt;remember as a child in the 70's wanting to do things<br/>
&gt;on Sunday, but nope, blue laws have the places closed.<br/>
&gt;It seems like they loved to roll up the sidewalk at 7<br/>
&gt;p.m. on Saturday night, and unroll it again at 6:30 am<br/>
&gt;on Monday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That's New England for you!<br/>
