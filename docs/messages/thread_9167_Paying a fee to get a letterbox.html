in.<br/>
I have had to pay $4, $3, $2 etc etc in day use fees to enter many of <br/>
the parks where letterboxes are located. I have paid untold amounts <br/>
of money to parking meters, toll bridges and toll roads.  And I have <br/>
bought wilderness passes so that I can park at some remote spots.<br/>
<br/>
It is extremely nice if you go ahead and mention in your clues that <br/>
there is a fee, so that folks will be prepared. (Many times, I have <br/>
been digging around under the backseat of my car to find enough <br/>
quarters to pay a day use fee after I spent my last dollar on a <br/>
milkshake at the drivethru!)<br/>

I think the fee improves the quality of a place by the act of requiring a fee.<br/>
And that's something we all enjoy.<br/>
