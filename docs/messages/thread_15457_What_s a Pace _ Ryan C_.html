&gt; *in general*, *on average*, do most of you consider a pace as 1 <br/>
&gt; footfall? <br/>
<br/>
During the Civil War, the military designated a "pace" as 28 inches. Soldiers <br/>
were expected to practice and march at 28 inch paces, 90 per minute, for a <br/>
uniform display. If you measure heel to heel (or toe to toe) while walking, a <br/>
pace should be about that length.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this is not an accepted "rule" in letterboxing as there are no <br/>
hard and fast rules but this is what my Civil War buff husband (Old Blue) has <br/>
always used when we write clues.<br/>
<br/>
Or, if you'd like to try another way to attempt to measure a pace (driving <br/>
yourself crazy in the process) try Ryan Carpenter's Applegate Rest Stop <br/>
Letterbox in Oregon!<br/>

Amen to that! I spent 90 minutes on that one and only got 1/3 of the way through.  And if you want a REAL pace counting challenge, try counting paces while detouring around a parked car, around active sprinklers, around picnickers, etc.  :P<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I had 3 other people sweltering in the car in temperatures above 95 degrees so I had to abandon my quest.<br/>
