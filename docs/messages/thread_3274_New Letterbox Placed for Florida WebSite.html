BOK TOWER GARDENS is a national historic landmark located at the summit of <br/>
Iron Mountain in central Florida.  With its serene gardens, vast wildlife, <br/>
gentle solitude and beauty, it is said to be: “a glorious tapestry of <br/>
nature.”   There are numerous paths to explore and one could spend several <br/>
hours ambling and not see it all!  BOK’s centerpiece, the Carillon Tower, <br/>
reigns over the highest point in Florida.  Here the views of the countryside <br/>
are phenomenal!  The carillon strikes each 1/2 hr. followed by a chorus of <br/>
the bells.  At 3:00 on most days, you can hear a LIVE recital by the resident <br/>
carillonneur.  <br/>
<br/>
The Garden’s website is linked above.  It will provide you with a map for <br/>
directions to the property, along with a tremendous amount of other <br/>
information.  Check it out!<br/>
<br/>
Please enter the grounds on foot through the new Education and Visitor Center <br/>
Complex.  You may wish to visit the Orientation Theater, Exhibit Hall, or the <br/>
Carillon Cafe.  Both the Gift Shop and the Plant Shop are wonderful, and may <br/>
be best left for the end.   Ready to start now??<br/>

<br/>
BOK Letterbox #1:<br/>
<br/>
First, seek out the small statue of St. Francis feeding the birds.  Which way <br/>
does his face point?  Follow in the direction of his nose as he is telling <br/>
you which pathway to take next.  When strolling this pathway, you will be <br/>
passing by a bench dedicated to "Judge Warlow," and you will arrive at a <br/>
‘T.’ Both routes are very scenic, but if it’s the letterbox you’re after, <br/>
choosing the path to the right will be wrong for now. <br/>
<br/>
Take three dozen paces down the mulched path and you will find a secluded <br/>
seating area on your left.  Enter that area and rest on the black wrought <br/>
iron park bench.  In the 12 o'clock position you will see a medium-sized <br/>
magnolia tree.  Past it, at 11 o'clock position, grows a giant live oak tree, <br/>
surrounded by a palm tree and other greenery.  Discretely, check out the base <br/>
of the palm tree.  Did you find what you were seeking?<br/>
<br/>
You may wish to go back to the bench to stamp logs, write us a note, etc.  Ple<br/>
ase replace the box as you found it while passersby are not looking! This can <br/>
be a very popular, busy place from January-April, especially.<br/>
<br/>
If you wish to continue looking for letterbox #2 at this time, we suggest you <br/>
return on the same footpaths just taken until you find the bench dedicated to <br/>
‘Mrs. T. P. Wallow, Sr.’ Sit on the bench.  After resting a bit, follow the <br/>
short path directly ahead leading to a gate. Pausing at that gate, you will <br/>
find a very special view of Historic Pinewood Estate. (Notes about this <br/>
secluded property are found in your Guide Map.)  While there are other routes <br/>
to take to seek box #2, we thought you should not go home without at least <br/>
peeking at this lovely, Mediterranean-revival showcase.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BOK Letterbox #2:<br/>
<br/>
Find Exedra and the Sunset Overlook.  This area is the highest point in <br/>
Florida!!  Isn’t it beautiful?  When you’re ready to leave this breathtaking <br/>
view, take one of the mulched paths due south.  <br/>
<br/>
Look for a short westardly path off this main path. It leads you to a <br/>
monument with dove carvings which is a tribute to Edward Bok.  After taking a <br/>
moment to enjoy this monument, walk to the left side of it and go BEHIND it.  <br/>
(A route taken only by a few people!)<br/>
<br/>
Proceed walking west through a small parking area.  Ahead of you lies an <br/>
older building (former Education Center). Walk to the left side of the <br/>
building, past the short, black chainlink fencing, and down the old steps.  <br/>
(Anyone looking??)<br/>
<br/>
At the landing of these steps you will find yet another overwhelming view.  <br/>
Look at all the space!  Notice all the live oak trees with dead cypress <br/>
hanging down?  The live oak with a "snag'" is the one to go to.  (Refer to <br/>
'The Knoll' in your GuideMap to see a picture of a snag!)  At it's base is a <br/>
long log of one of the old trees.  Which end holds Letterbox #2??  (Be <br/>
careful; it's shoved in quite aways.  Need a stick?  Any animals living in <br/>
there?)  Enjoy stamping and returning it safely.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Have you heard the Singing Tower yet?  You may get to the back side of the <br/>
tower by taking a much less populated route: simply proceed south from <br/>
letterbox #2 site, along the vast lawned area and climb up the short hill to <br/>
the tower’s oak grove.  You have now arrived at one of the Garden’s quiet <br/>
listening areas.  Relax and enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
As you leave the Tower area to complete your explorations, don’t forget to <br/>
view the various angles of the Reflection Pool (Circle 2 on the GuideMap.)  <br/>
Have you seen the family of swans in residence there?  Most people don’t know <br/>
they exist.  Shh-h-h.  It’s special!! <br/>
<br/>
If your time (and energy level) allows, you should see circled areas 11 and <br/>
12.  The Preserve Trail is a 1/2 hr. walk through a longleaf pine forest with <br/>
shaded benches and signs posted to guide you on your observations of the <br/>
natural Central Florida Ridge ecosystem.  Did you take time to go to The <br/>
Knoll?  (Circle 13).  You won't be sorry.  This trail terminates at the <br/>
parking area.    <br/>
<br/>
We hope you have had an enjoyable day.  Comments are always welcomed in the <br/>
log books or at our websites above.<br/>
