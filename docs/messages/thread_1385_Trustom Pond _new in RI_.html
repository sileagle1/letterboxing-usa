<br/>
Trustom Pond<br/>
<br/>
A delightful and gentle two-mile walk on the Rhode Island shore with <br/>
views of salt ponds and barrier islands, and splendid birding, for a <br/>
pair of letterboxes. You could also easily include the "Trustom Pond <br/>
Quest" letterbox along the way for a triple.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: In Charlestown RI on Rte. 1 between Moonstone and <br/>
Ninigret Beaches, turn south to Green Hill Beach. This is Post Rd: <br/>
after a couple hundred yards, turn left onto Green Hill Beach Rd and <br/>
follow it for 0.7 miles to the end. Turn left at the stop sign, then <br/>
quickly left again onto Matunuck School House Rd. After 0.8 miles, <br/>
find the Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge entrance on your right.<br/>
<br/>
The Trustom Pond NWR occupies old farmland bordering salt pond <br/>
estuary. There are two connected loop trails, each with a southward-<br/>
pointing extension that leads to observation towers over the <br/>
wetlands. From the parking lot, if the small headquarters is open, <br/>
grab a map. Then follow the well maintained path past a map board to <br/>
skirt a field and pass a farm pond. The trail turns to grass. Turn to <br/>
the path bearing 144 degrees, and then at another map, go left to 134 <br/>
degrees. Follow this straight old farm road past a lovely bench and <br/>
out to the observation tower: the East Point Letterbox is behind the <br/>
stairs, under a flat rock.<br/>
<br/>
Now return to the map by the farm pond and turn onto 244 to cross a <br/>
short boardwalk. At a wide intersection, go 270 degrees and then 282 <br/>
degrees at the next intersection, towards the second observation <br/>
tower. This path will lead you up to another crossing with a bench <br/>
and map: turn to 146 degrees. This larger, more isolated observation <br/>
tower is the place for a rest! Again, peak behind the stairs and <br/>
under a flat rock for the West Point Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
When you've had your fill of this expansive place, return to the last <br/>
map to plot your next adventure!<br/>
