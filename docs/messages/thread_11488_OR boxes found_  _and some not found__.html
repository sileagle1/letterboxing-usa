<br/>
On Monday, I got out to do some birthday letterboxing and was semi-<br/>
successful!<br/>
<br/>
First, hit the Mom, Mexico and Me boxes in Mary S. Young Rec Area.  I <br/>
found the #1, 2, and 4 boxes.  #5 was posted as missing as of last <br/>
January.  #3 stumped me bigtime.  It was amazingly frustrating <br/>
because I am POSITIVE that I was at the right log, but so many people <br/>
kept walking by that I eventually gave up, thinking I would come back <br/>
for it later.  I was also frustrated by the fact that I forgot my <br/>
gloves at home, so I was a little nervous about scavenging around for <br/>
boxes #6 and 7.  Hopefully I will get back to this park soon to hunt <br/>
those three boxes down!<br/>
<br/>
Next, I headed for the West Linn mystery box--but there are two <br/>
places where rivers meet in the West Linn area and I think that I was <br/>
at the wrong place, so again I will need to try again!<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I was successful at finding the Oregon Trail box in Oregon <br/>
City, which wasn't too difficult, but the stamp is pretty cool.  It's <br/>
funny how you live so close to these places like the End of the <br/>
Oregon Trail and never visit them until you are looking for a <br/>
letterbox!<br/>
<br/>

P.S.  Today I'm headed out to the Broughton's Bluff, Mt Tabor and <br/>
Rocky Butte boxes to introduce a friend to this wonderful hobby!  <br/>
