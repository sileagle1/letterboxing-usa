pulled for maintenance, it has now been replaced to its hiding spot.  <br/>
Also in the Mosquito Lake Series, Squirrel Run Trial Box and Beaver <br/>
Trail Box now have hand carved stamps in them.  When I first started I <br/>
was eager to get a few boxes hid I purchased the stamps for those two <br/>
boxes.  Well, they're now hand carved and kind of cute!!!! <br/>
