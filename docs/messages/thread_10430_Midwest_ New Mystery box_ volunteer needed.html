Due to the weather (below 0F with wind chill) I hid this very <br/>
quickly. Due to snow, I'm not sure the clues are correct (trails <br/>
were hard to follow) or if you may need to trample sensitive land to <br/>
get to the box. It should be pretty easy to find, once you've <br/>
figured out the right park it is in. I can give more straightforward <br/>
clues to the first person who tells me the city it's in and <br/>
volunteers to verify accuracy and acceptability of location.<br/>

Thanks!<br/>

I'm the Webmaster for the Midwest states (except Nebraska) and have no<br/>
clue about this -- I even looked at my map. Because this box could be<br/>
associated with any of several states, the link to the clues page should<br/>
go on the main Mystery Box Web page.<br/>
