Paint Creek State Park, near Bainbridge, Ross County, Ohio. <br/>
Difficulty: Easy. You will begin at the large parking area which is <br/>
below the spillway. CLUES: Find the sign for the .5 mile Harmony <br/>
Trail. Follow the trail along the creek and through the picnic area--<br/>
-you will be going in generally an east/southeast direction.(The <br/>
trail is marked periodically with round blue metal disks with silver <br/>
arrows on them).At the far end of the picnic area,the trail starts <br/>
through the woods. From this point, start counting your paces as you <br/>
proceed down the trail.At 28 paces you will arrive at another trail <br/>
marker which is attached to a tree to the left of the trail. Stop <br/>
here and take a reading of 140 degrees. Go 4 paces at that heading. <br/>
Mallard Fillmore is hiding under and between 2 small, moss-covered <br/>
fallen logs.<br/>
