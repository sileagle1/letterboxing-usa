offers some excellent suggestions and comments on posting such photos on our<br/>
Kids Corner pages, so I wanted to share them with the group...<br/>

<br/>
&gt; May I suggest that you use their "Letterboxing Names" rather than any<br/>
&gt;  other....The full details are here for you<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  The first is ...<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  My son aged 11...then ..<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  (Leo) ...known as "The Dancing Dragon" .....  on Zeal Tor on Brent Moor<br/>
&gt;  (Dartmoor).  The  box (pillbox sort) and stamp can be seen quite clearly I<br/>
&gt;  think...<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  The Second is Anika aged 9<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  known as "Flower Fairy"....the box (tupperware sort) and her stamp is<br/>
&gt;  clearly visible....<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Hope these are acceptable....<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Best Wishes <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Graham Howard....<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  ps I assume that if later ( for whatever reason...kids do have their own<br/>
&gt;  ideas ) we wish to have them removed from the site you will also do that<br/>
&gt;  for us ?  Please accept them on that basis..Thanks....!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Graham's suggestion to use letterboxing aliases instead of real names is an<br/>
excellent idea.  This is the direction I will take on posting these photos.<br/>
Please include such info when you send your pictures.  And, of course, all<br/>
photos that are submitted will be accepted on the basis that they can be<br/>
removed by request at ANY TIME whatsoever.  Thank you, Graham, for your<br/>
excellent input.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mitch<br/>
