<div>With the change of weather ,I wondered what 
other letterboxers in So.Cal did during the bright sunshine of our "winter". 
Have you switched to a 15 SPF rather than a 30 SPF factor on your sunscreen ? 
Did you switch from your designer sunglasses to Polaroid's so you can find the 
boxes easier in the bright sun? Are you still wearing the Panama hat or have you 
gone to a baseball cap ? Are you still toughening it out in shorts or have you 
had to switch to levis ? Should you take a wind breaker type jacket on your hike 
just in case it gets really cold, like down to 65 degrees ? Do you wear 
socks with your sandals ? This message sent by request of Jay Drew who now longs

I must admit I am having withdrawal symptoms.  Between the snow and my boxing buddy being out of town this week I'm itching to get out there and see what we can do even with a foot of snow on the ground.  I'll have to take the dog to hide out tracks!<br/>
Maybe next week if it melts some...<br/>
