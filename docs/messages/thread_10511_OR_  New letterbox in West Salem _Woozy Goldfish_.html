West Salem<br/>

<br/>
CLUES:  This little caper occurred in Wallace Marine Park so that's <br/>
just where you'll have to be to solve it.  It seems a little <br/>
goldfish escaped from the Willamette River and is feeling a bit <br/>
woozy these days.  He really needs your help getting him revived so <br/>
he can soon return to the water.  He so much wanted to go on an <br/>
adventure and do what 2 legged 'air-breathers' do for a bit but his <br/>
adventure has gotten him into a bind (or a box, that is).  Armed <br/>
with a sense of adventure and not much else--he jumped out of the <br/>
river, up the boat launch ramp and onto the street.  He wriggled <br/>
down the road, heading West under the trestle (as the vehicles go).  <br/>
He wriggled and flopped along the road veering to the right but <br/>
staying left of the grand trees, boulders and curb.  He flopped and <br/>
he flopped past 5 'no parking' signs.  At the fifth sign he heard <br/>
something odd, so he flopped right around and hopped 15 times back <br/>
retracing his tracks thinking he could hear it a bit better from <br/>
there.  At that moment, he was on a little striped mound.  He heard <br/>
something else that really startled him, so he dashed into the woods <br/>
toward the river and hid in the entangled roots behind (NE side) the <br/>
nearest large tree on the left.  Here he remains feeling a little <br/>
scared, quite woozy and desperate for your help.  Please discreetly <br/>
find him, stamp a little life into him and return him to his hiding <br/>
place.  He's a little orphan so take good care of him.  Email <br/>

This sounds like a very ambitious series, "dvn2r ckr's series of letterboxes<br/>
involving goldfish located in cities adjacent to state capitals"<br/>
<br/>
First was Goldfish in Lacey, now Woozy Goldfish in West Salem, can't wait<br/>
for the next.  Maybe it will be Baked Goldfish in Tempe, or Frozen Goldfish<br/>
in West Juneau?<br/>
<br/>
Will have to save 8 or 9 pages in my logbook so I can group all 50 of them<br/>
together!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Fudrick, waiting anxiously<br/>
