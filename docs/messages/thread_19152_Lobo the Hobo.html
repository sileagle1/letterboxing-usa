We took someone out for her first find in Burlington, VT.  They have a bridge to nowhere, paid for by their taxes.  It really goes nowhere!  She thought it would be a great place for a letterbox, and it is.  Then we heard of another Bridge to Nowhere LB.  It isn't a problem, since it's a common-enough thought, and they're not going to be in the smae room.  No one will pussue yopu for copyright infringement, and we all get a kick out of it!<br/>

I expected a plethora (at least a metric plethora) of Vagabonds and Hobos, and was amazed there wasn't a Bindlestiff, so I made one. Happy times!<br/>
