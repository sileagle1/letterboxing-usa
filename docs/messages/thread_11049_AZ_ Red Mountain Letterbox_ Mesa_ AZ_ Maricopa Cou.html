Red Mountain Letterbox by Nailhead of the Nail Family<br/>
Placed 3/4/03 <br/>
Location:  Granite Reef Park, Mesa, AZ, Maricopa County<br/>
Difficulty:  clues-very easy, trail-even easier<br/>
Distance: less than 1/2 mile round trip<br/>
Access fee:  $4 per day, $2 for qualified seniors.  Use fee is valid at any Tonto National Forest access area for the day purchased. A ticket machine is located in the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Granite Reef Park is on the south side of the Salt River (Rio Salado) at the confluence of the Verde River.  The park, part of the Tonto National Forest boasts a very impressive view of Red Mountain across the river.  Red Mountain is a major landmark in the Mesa/Tempe area which can be seen from all over the desert area.  In pioneer times, all major roads running east and west to and from Mesa referenced Red Mountain as an easily identified landmark to navigate by. The park is nestled in a very nice little mesquite bosque or thicket along the river.  The soil is very rich here and the mesquite trees grow well next to the river.  This is a popular spot with locals for picnics and fishing in the river which holds many popular gamefish such as Largemouth Bass, Crappie, Bluegill, Catfish and Rainbow Trout.  One of the few shady parks in the area.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Drive in and park in the parking lot at this small park.  <br/>
Make sure you purchase a day use ticket (the ticket is good for any Tonto National Forest access site for the day of purchase so dont lose it, there could be other boxes located nearby).  <br/>
<br/>
Start at the picnic area on the West end of the park.  <br/>
Walk along the fence and pass thru the opening in the fence and between the large stones to the undeveloped part of the park that runs downstream along the river.   <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the beauty and rare shade of the mesquite trees here. The native indians used to use the beans that grow on these trees in long pods as a very nutritional food source.  They would roast them and eat like nuts or grind into paste.  They are rich in protein which can be very scarce in the desert.<br/>
<br/>
As you continue walking along the river bank, pass the cane brakes on the shore.  Keep an eye out for warning bouys in the river.  When you come to a place where the bouys line up (you cant really see it because of the cane brake at this point) you are very near the box.<br/>
<br/>
Locate the split tree on the riverside of the trail.  From this split tree, take a bearing of 240 magnetic to find another mesquite with a recently chopped limb missing.  The Red Mountain resides under a sandstone at its base.  <br/>
<br/>
Because this park is very popular due to its proximity to the river and its shady trees, it is very crowded at times.  Please be very discreet when finding the box and rehide carefully so as not to make the box evident or to disturb the natural area.<br/>
<br/>
After logging in and rehiding, continue along the trail if you like or saunter back to the picnic area for a rest in the shade.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy the river, the mountain, and the box.  <br/>

Warning:  scorpions, snakes, spiders, and other malcontents often encroach on the natural habitat of letterboxes.  Take care to not reach in to any crevices or holes without using a poke stick first to make the critters mad. Once you have made the animals sufficiently angry, then reach in for the box.
