                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was looking around the website and noticed a couple of mistakes <br/>
regarding some of the boxes out there (including my own).<br/>
<br/>
1. The Crappy Stamp letterbox (listed under Oregon &gt; Portland Area) <br/>
should have a link directly to my clue, not another link to my clue!<br/>
<br/>
2. The Land of Long Ago mystery box isn't listed on the mystery box <br/>
page.  The URL for the clue is at <br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/Mystery/LandOfLongAgo and it <br/>
was placed in November of 2002.  The hint for the clue can say its <br/>
somewhere in the western states on Highway 101.<br/>
<br/>
3. I was looking under the Mystery Box section in Oregon and noticed <br/>
a new letterbox I hadn't noticed before: The Woodsy Mystery Box.  <br/>
Imagine my surprise when I followed the link and it was my own Crappy <br/>
Stamp letterbox clue that appeared!!!  I don't know where the <br/>
original posting for this clue was (I haven't searched the archives, <br/>
but it's probably there), but the link is definitely not correct!<br/>
<br/>
That's all the errors I found for now!  Thanks for getting them <br/>
fixed!  =)<br/>
