Subject: [L-USA] Orphan Letterboxes / Semantics<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Orphans (or is there another name for a box like this?:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I'm just wondering how many of our letterboxes are<br/>
&gt;orphan letterboxes.... that is, placed with no intention<br/>
&gt;of following up on its condition etc.<br/>
&gt;Should we know before looking for it that it is an orphan?<br/>
&gt;That is, if the box is listed on the L-USA site should it <br/>
&gt;be designated as orphan online and searchers could take <br/>
&gt;extra supplies to replace full journals, etc.? How long should<br/>
&gt;an orphan box be listed? If no one has ever found it or looked<br/>
&gt;for it, how will we know it's still there? Since most letterboxes here<br/>
&gt;are few and far between so far, it makes sense to me that there<br/>
&gt;be some kind of policy in place for listing them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;More semantics:<br/>
&gt;   Is there an official Dartmoor word for putting a letterbox<br/>
&gt;out? I have always used the word "place"; I notice that<br/>
&gt;others use "plant".... just curious.<br/>
&gt;It would be fun to have a "letterbox lingo list" ~ to introduce<br/>
&gt;and define words like "stamping up", etc.<br/>

&gt;Hi Deborah<br/>
<br/>
After reading some neat articles about Dartmoor Letterboxers,<br/>
I found their term of "salting" a good shop talk term for "placing"<br/>
letterboxes.  So they are busy "salting" the counryside with their<br/>
boxes at this very moment!!<br/>
<br/>
re the orphaned letterboxes,  I would probably make a note inside the<br/>
box and write maybe "found 3-17-99 and adopted by Greg Bradley<br/>
LUSA member"  and then followup with the club to re-establish it<br/>
anyway that is necessary or what ever the filing system is by that time.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and welcome.<br/>
