<br/>
We get a lot of "thanks for the great box notes," and often want to respond <br/>
with "thanks for looking!" We love placing letterboxes, but it is the Finders <br/>
that give planting its sparkle. Finding a letterbox involves a certain letting <br/>
go, giving oneself over to another. Remember that old camp game where one <br/>
person is blindfolded and must trust another to lead them through an obstacle <br/>
course? Letterboxing is like that. Trusting us with their morning adventure, <br/>
Finders have a special kind of reliance on us and we really appreciate the effort <br/>
they give our little creations.<br/>
<br/>
Some of our boxes are ridiculously vague, yet intrepid friends seek them out. <br/>
You all do us great compliment and we thank you.<br/>
<br/>
This summer/fall we have indulged in some box maintenance, visiting over 100 <br/>
letterboxes. Each one was well hidden, nicely bagged, and had endearing <br/>
comments in the log. Many Finders have re-boxed, re-logged, and even re-carved for <br/>
us. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
The notes you send us go on the fridge by the math homework and the children <br/>
delight in them. So to all those who give the gift of Finding, thank you very <br/>
much! We really appreciate you.<br/>

And we appreciate you.  In fact, if I can get off my butt, I will <br/>
soon send a little something to materially back up the gratitude and <br/>
esteem I have for you.<br/>
