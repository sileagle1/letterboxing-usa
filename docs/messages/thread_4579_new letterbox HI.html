                    <div class="plaintext-content">On February 26, 2002 Funhog placed the King's Highway Letterbox near the<br/>
town of Kihei, Maui County, Hawaii. During this wonderful hike you will<br/>
walk on an ancient road, past hand-built Hawaiian walls and the ruins of<br/>
many heiau (shrines or temples) and hale (houses.) Be sure to wear sturdy<br/>
shoes and carry plenty of water since you will traverse hot, dry lava<br/>
fields. Allow two hours roundtrip for this quest. If you have more time,<br/>
bring lunch and have a picnic at the stunning beach near the letterbox. In<br/>
season you may even see a breaching whale.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: from Kihei head south on Wailea Alanui past Makena to the<br/>
end of the pavement. You will see a stone monument mauka (towards the<br/>
mountains.) Turn right and park your car. Walk makai (towards the ocean)<br/>
then look left for a row of large orange boulders. The King's Highway Trail<br/>
begins behind these rocks.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: follow this trail across a small lava field, along a<br/>
shady path, past a rocky beach. There are traditional Hawaiian walls along<br/>
this portion of the trail. At the far end of this bay you will come to a<br/>
wire fence. Twenty five steps from the beginning of this fence you will<br/>
come to a stile. Go mauka here but then do not stray right or left until<br/>
you see a verdant glen. With this oasis in sight begin looking makai for a<br/>
Hawaiian wall. You will come to a small trail marked with a couple of white<br/>
rocks that passes through a cleft in this wall. Follow this trail toward<br/>
the palms until these two sentinels frame a large boulder, the guardian of<br/>
the letterbox. The box is on the mauka side of this boulder marked by a<br/>
white rock. Aloha!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On February 22, 2003 Funhog placed the Celestial Bodies Letterbox on the Island of Oahu, Hawaii. The beaches <br/>
of Hawaii are not the only place you are able to watch heavenly bodies adorned in minimal attire. This two mile <br/>
roundtrip trek up the slopes of Makapu'u Point will expand your viewing possibilities. There is little shade along <br/>
this path. Don't forget water and sunscreen.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: Makapu'u State Recreation Area is located off Highway 72 on the Southeast section of Oahu <br/>
between Koko Crater and Sea Life Park. There is a gated entry on the makai side of the road about a mile past <br/>
mile marker 9 coming from Honolulu. Park on the road and walk through the gate following the paved path uphill.<br/>
<br/>
To the Letterbox: Along the way you will find something you might find useful when watching heavenly bodies. <br/>
Leviathans are nearby. From this point walk about 55 Steps due North down a rocky path. The box is nestled <br/>
in the shade beneath a flattish piece of lava to your right.<br/>

This was one of my favorite places to hike when we lived in HI.  Did <br/>
you see the whales?<br/>
