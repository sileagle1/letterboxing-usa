&gt; &gt; &gt; Pentagon City Mall food court<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Arlington, VA<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Saturday, January 24th<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 10:30am - 2:00pm or whenever (open to timing suggestions)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Draft Agenda:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - 10:00am - Organizers arrive and round up tables (Me and who <br/>
&gt; else?)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - 10:30am - Letterboxers wandering around trying to find each <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; other. :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - 10:00am - 2:00pm - Ongoing exchanges everywhere.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - 11:00am - Welcome.  First of many introductions all around. <br/>
&gt; Praise <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and welcome for the out of towners.  Announcments.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - 11:30am - Food.  Try to beat the lines of teenage student <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tourists.  Though that may be minimal in Jan.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - 1:00pm - Group picture.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - 1:15pm - hitchhiker exchange<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What else?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The place is a little noisy to try to do a seminar though I <br/>
hope <br/>
&gt; many <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will show samples of their crafts.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe Randy Hall can come and sign his book?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone want to contribute an event stamp?  Do we need a theme?  <br/>
&gt; The <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mall isn't much of a theme to work with.  Arlington maybe.  I <br/>
&gt; hope to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; carve a new stamp for "It's A Holiday" which is very nearby.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If there is interest I will make a booklet of nearby VA and DC <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxes which I'll pass out.  Though the intent of a winter <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; gather is more to get together and socialize than to box.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is anyone interested in a mystery dinner gathering that <br/>
evening? <br/>
&gt; If <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; only a couple people are interested I'll still organize it <br/>
&gt; (because <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that would make 3 of us).<br/>
