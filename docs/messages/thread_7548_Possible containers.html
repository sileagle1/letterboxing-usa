<br/>We found a HH once that had it's own box that was a tennis ball tube converted for use as a traveling container. It seemed to do the job fairly well.
<br/>
<br/>While I'm on the subject, has anyone else found a HH that had it's own traveling box?

The Backpacker HH is in its own Rubbermaid sandwich box -- makes <br/>
hiding it a little difficult because you have to put it in a location <br/>
large enough for two boxes!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm with the school of thought that no containers that used to hold <br/>
any sort of food item is acceptable -- WAY to attractive to <br/>
rodents/bears/other wildlife, even when washed out with bleach!<br/>
<br/>
My two containers of choice are Rubbermaid sandwich containers, and <br/>
especially the wonderful Rubbermaid drink bottles -- those are <br/>
impervious to everything! The only drawback to the bottles is that <br/>
the stamp can't be wider than 1.75 inches, and the log must be able <br/>
to fit through the 2-inch hole, too. I still use two ziploc-type bags <br/>
in each container, one for the log and info sheets, one for the stamp <br/>
(so the ink doesn't get all over everything in the container). If I'm <br/>
really worried about the box, I enclose the whole thing in a Ziploc <br/>
freezer bag, too.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the specially bought containers add a real cost factor to each <br/>
box, but hey -- this is a great hobby, and is still cheaper than a <br/>
lot of other pastimes!<br/>

I know that there's been suggestions about not using food product <br/>
containers...but did you consider...<br/>
<br/>
Cold Cream, Play Doh, and cosmetic products may also have scents that <br/>
attract animals...I had mistakenly put a list up of items that were food <br/>
containers...and going through my summer camp list...they suggest not <br/>
keeping certain cosmetic items in your tent...<br/>

each at my local Salvation Army store in the 'plasticware last stop <br/>
before Heaven' section!!!<br/>

Can't beat the price, can't beat the quality and you save some room <br/>
