<br/>
It seems that my "There and Back Again" hitchhiker has<br/>
gotten himself into a little jam.  The stamp and the<br/>
logbook have inadvertantly been separated.  The<br/>
logbook was found in Pokomoke State Park but the stamp<br/>
is left in Tennessee in the box referenced below.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone out there who would be kind enough to<br/>
gather the stamp from the box it's hidden with, email<br/>
me to let me know, and I'll send you some $ to send it<br/>
back to me so that I can reunite it with it's logbook?<br/>
<br/>
If no one is able I guess I can carve a new stamp for<br/>
the log book and let them both travel about. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks- please let me know!<br/>

&gt; Hi:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    On our way to Gatlinburg, TN, we found the "There<br/>
&gt; &amp; Back Again" <br/>
&gt; Hitchhiker planted by the Drew Clan with the Lord of<br/>
&gt; the Rings <br/>
&gt; series of boxes in Carlisle, PA. The Lord of the<br/>
&gt; Rings Series was <br/>
&gt; great. Our nieces were so excited. This was our<br/>
&gt; first hitchhiker and <br/>
&gt; we were all thrilled to find it on August 10th.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    The Hitchhiker now resides with the Davy Crockett<br/>
&gt; letterbox in a <br/>
&gt; park that shares his name in Limestone, TN. It is a<br/>
&gt; great stamp and <br/>
&gt; we thoroughly enjoyed finding and having it with us<br/>
&gt; on our vacation <br/>
&gt; to Gatlinburg!<br/>
