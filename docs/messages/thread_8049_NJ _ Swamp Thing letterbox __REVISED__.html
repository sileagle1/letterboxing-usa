WEBMASTERS, kindly replace the existing clues for Swamp Thing with <br/>

"SWAMP THING" LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
Estell Manor Park (Atlantic County)<br/>
109 Rte. 50<br/>
Mays Landing, NJ <br/>
rating: Easy 2.5 miles, flat terrain<br/>
placed in new location 9/24/01<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lovely Estell Manor Park in Mays Landing, NJ is about 30 minutes west <br/>
of Atlantic City, part of the Atlantic County Park system. There are <br/>
numerous points of interest within its boundaries, including the <br/>
foundation ruins of an old World War I munitions factory, an old <br/>
glassworks site, a playground, canoe/kayak launch, nature center, and <br/>
observation deck. So wander the woods and enjoy the trails as you <br/>
seek the box (and try not to think about what you lost at the casino!)<br/>
<br/>
Note: A park trail map is recommended, but not necessary. Available <br/>
at the nature center. <br/>
<br/>
Park at the Nature Center. As you face the building, take the asphalt <br/>
path to your left.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the asphalt, continue straight ahead. Resist the urge <br/>
to take the boardwalk trail that splits off to the left. Follow the <br/>
dirt path instead and soon you will fork left 115 degrees east onto <br/>
the LAUREL TRAIL.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the Laurel Trail, passing post #'s 9, 10, 7, and 11 as you <br/>
weave through beautiful mountain laurel, longleaf pine, and huge <br/>
American Holly (some of the biggest we've seen!) When it<br/>
intersects <br/>
at a "T" with the CENTER TRAIL, turn left here 60 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't quite Atlantic City's Boardwalk, but it will guide you <br/>
safely through this maple swamp. Beware of trolls under the bridge!<br/>
<br/>
As you cross the road, stay straight on the trail. Note that the name <br/>
changes to MISTLETOE. Though other paths may tempt you, stay your <br/>
course on this one and soon you'll be on the "SWAMP TRAIL BOARDWALK". <br/>
Wander along the boards for awhile as they weave through this <br/>
beautiful maple swamp with cedars, pitch pine, and sweetgum.<br/>
<br/>
After a lengthy straightaway on the boards, (and one small bend), you <br/>
will see a signboard and bench. What you seek is not far! As you sit <br/>
and face the sign, the Swamp Thing lives under the boardwalk on a <br/>
support beam to the right of the sign posts. If the coast is clear, <br/>
hop off the boards and bring the Swamp Thing out of hiding. <br/>
Congratulations! Sit comfy and stamp in!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Getting back:<br/>
<br/>
RETURN OPTION 1: Enjoy the river, ruins, cemetery and more! Continue <br/>
along the boardwalk to the end. (NOTE: The "endpoint" of the <br/>
boardwalk will change as it is built further out toward Artesian Well <br/>
Road). Pass marker #234 and come to a "T". Go left (due west)<br/>
and <br/>
explore the old Powerhouse ruins, artesian well and Smith-Ireland <br/>
cemetery. You'll come upon a large clearing and campfire area.<br/>
(Have <br/>
they built the boardwalk back this far yet?) Take the dirt road to <br/>
the left (ARTESIAN WELL RD.) leading away from the boat ramp. <br/>
Shortly, another trail (OAK RIDGE TRAIL) will come in on your left. <br/>
Turn here heading south. Continue along Oak Ridge and cross the Eagle <br/>
footbridge. Soon after, there will be a cutout in the boardwalk on <br/>
your right.  Turn right here onto FROG POND ROAD. (You'll soon<br/>
see <br/>
signs confirming you are on the right track).<br/>
<br/>
When Frog Pond intersects with another large sand road (NORTH END <br/>
ROAD) turn left here and follow this road directly back to your car <br/>
and the nature center.<br/>
<br/>
RETURN OPTION 2: (SHORTER) Retrace your steps back, but where the <br/>
dirt trail meets the boards, STAY on the boards and they will take <br/>
you back to the beginning at the asphalt path.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoyed this scenic park!<br/>
