Also, there are some boxes that I can't tell if they count as orphaned or<br/>
not.  If they were entered with a hyperlink, the page doesn't ever list who<br/>
did them, but goes straight to the page.  I have wished many times that the<br/>
page that lists boxes in a region also listed who planted them, now that I<br/>
am having to go through each individual box to see if it is orphaned or not,<br/>
I really wish this feature were there.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'm concerned that some historic boxes may be lost.  For instance,<br/>
the first box planted in UT (and one of the earliest I found) is one by Der<br/>
Mad Stamper.  I have tried contacting the address often and never had a<br/>
reply.  I heard some chatter indicating that his boxes would be lost if we<br/>
erased orphaned boxes (I haven't been here long enough to know if there is<br/>
something I should know about him, I hope I'm not treading on sensitive<br/>
ground.  I have just wondered what happened since he sounds like one of the<br/>
pioneers of letterboxing).  Anyway, if boxes were transferred as hyperlinks<br/>
like his were, but never claimed, will they be erased too?<br/>
<br/>
I've gone through the boxes in my surrounding states and sent emails to all<br/>
of the ones that had contact info embedded in the clue, but haven't claimed<br/>
them personally (you'd be surprised how many were like this).  I hope that<br/>
others will do the same.  There may be some that will wake up and claim<br/>
their boxes if we do. <br/>

I am putting in my vote for allowing active boxers to take ownership <br/>
for some of the orphaned boxes.  As you say, some of them are truly <br/>
lost and this seems a good way to flush them out, but many are still <br/>
in place and are popular hunts for people in those areas.  It would <br/>
be a shame for the clues to those boxes to just fall off into <br/>
netherland, expecially since the boxes will still be in place.  I <br/>
know there are orphaned boxes in West/Northern Michigan that are very <br/>
near to some of my boxes.  I kind of keep an eye on them already just <br/>
because I know that the placer is either far away or no longer <br/>
active, and would be happy to take over responsibility for them going <br/>
forward.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we could add a blurb to these clues when they are transferred <br/>
to a new owner, indicating what has been done and why.  This way if <br/>
the original planters do find their way back, they won't be perplexed <br/>
as to why their box is listed as someone else's, and can contact that <br/>
person via e-mail if desired.<br/>

I don't think he wants to "erase" them, just transfer them over to new owners <br/>
instead of being orphaned.<br/>

&gt; Exactly!   I can't fathom a reason to remove them and erase some of our <br/>
&gt; early history or more recent boxes from those who don't follow this list<br/>
&gt; for one reason or another.  What is the real impetus behind this?<br/>
<br/>
Some people are incorrectly assuming that the webmasters have placed these<br/>
boxes, and/or are responsible for maintaining them, or making sure they<br/>
are not missing, etc.  Right or wrong, and IMHO this is a silly assumption<br/>
for people to make, his is what some people are assuming.  The webmasters <br/>
do not want to be in that position.  If a social trail develops to these <br/>
boxes, or they become litter, it will be the webmasters, not the placer, <br/>
that the land manager will incorrectly send the irate mail to.  If anyone <br/>
in the community would rather be in this position, feel free to make the <br/>
appropriate arrangements.<br/>
<br/>
To some extent, it is a classic case of the few ruining it for the <br/>
many -- to be blunt, it s***s, but c'est la vie.  (as an example, people <br/>
are placing boxes on private land, not asking permission, and the webmasters <br/>
are hearing it from the land owner.  We don't know where these orphans are <br/>
and who placed them in some cases, as just an example -- we'd prefer the <br/>
account holders bear the brunt of this -- if they ignore their e-mail, its<br/>
still on them).<br/>
<br/>
This is a volunteer organization, and everyone in the community is expected<br/>
to contribute.  The webmasters do not wish to shoulder the burden of these<br/>
boxes, people throwing text onto the community and leaving, and wish every <br/>
box on the website to be under the e-mail address of an individual account <br/>
holder.  Note that there are alternatives to playing the game of letterboxing <br/>
that do not involve the LbNA web site.  If a person cannot be bothered to <br/>
maintain their box, it speaks volumes for their inability to maintain that<br/>
its placement is not causing environmental impact.<br/>
<br/>
For my part, I'd love these boxes to stay listed -- I'm one who believes <br/>
in the 5 year hunt and the crustyness of text -- but the realities are<br/>
insisting that each box be created and maintained by an individual<br/>
account holder.  The text still remains crusty in the google cache, the<br/>
list archives, personal web sites, and elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, there is precedent for this.  If you list a box in the Dartmoor<br/>
catalog, you are expected to renew this listing every two years (and don't<br/>
quote me on the details, I'm working from memory), or have the box <br/>
delisted from the catalog.  The motivations in Dartmoor are similar to <br/>
the motivations here, and there is very little difference.<br/>
<br/>
I realise this may be an unpopular decision for some.  All I ask is that<br/>
discussion of it remain civil.<br/>

I live near the Fox Run Park box. I would be willing to take on it's maintenance. It is in a city-owned park, and would be able to remove it if requested to do so by the city of Colorado Springs.<br/>
<br/>
That's it. No ulterior motives. Just hoping to keep one of 3(!) boxes in Colorado Springs in the field. We don't have a lot here. Please do consider letting us keep it.<br/>
<br/>
However, if you decide that this is unacceptable: I guess the alternative is for me to go replace it with one of my own and repost the clues.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that Dartmoor is the US model, however, how many boxes did they have in the area at last count? More than 3, right? To lose 1/3 of their boxes might make more of an impact. Dartmoor is a guideline, yes? I wasn't aware that we had such "rules" in place. Actually, doesn't letterboxing.org say specifically that there aren't any rules? Just to respect the land, yes?<br/>
