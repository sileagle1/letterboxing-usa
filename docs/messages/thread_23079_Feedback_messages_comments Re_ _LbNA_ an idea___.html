 Commentary to you about your boxes is one thing, you have control <br/>
over it. What FH is talking about is comments about FH's boxes in a <br/>
public place that FH has no control over. This war was fought a long <br/>
time ago (or at least it seems like a long time ago) and there really <br/>
were no victors. I'm with Funhog on this and would ask that no <br/>
comments on my boxes be made either. I do welcome comments either <br/>
through private email or here on the chat groups where I have the <br/>
opportunity to make my own comments or rebuttals. I enjoy hearing <br/>
from people who have found my boxes, though I have disabled the <br/>
status feature on the LbNA site. I enjoy knowing who has found my <br/>
boxes I just don't want anybody else to know who has been there <br/>
before them. And I certainly don't want someone who didn't find the <br/>
box to have the opportunity to mark my clue with this info. The <br/>
status feature has always been a thorn in my side because I feel that <br/>
me not having it enabled sends its own message. A message that comes <br/>
from my clues that I did not put there and have no control over.<br/>

I think you are wrong on this. The database idea was killed, but the <br/>
flag with the list of finders and attempts sprang up shortly there <br/>
after. So there were some victors. Those that dislike the record of <br/>
finders lost out.<br/>
<br/>
We do(reluctantly)enable the flag feature, but when someone <br/>
lists "attempted" on one of our harder boxes I usually post a note <br/>
in the clues indicating that the "attempted" listing reflects on the <br/>
finder's capabilities rather than the status of the letterbox. I <br/>
have even had some folks complain about my note, and my response was <br/>
to be more diligent in their search, and realize that using the <br/>
recording feature and listing attempts has some drawbacks.<br/>
<br/>
One result of the flag feature is the reduction of notes <br/>
from "Contact the Placer". I enjoy receiving notes regarding our <br/>
letterboxes and the new system seems very impersonal.<br/>

The 'cachers <br/>
&gt; seem pretty careful not to post spoilers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But they do.  I geocache without a GPS and often use the log <br/>
comments to help find the cache. That is, of course, when the trail<br/>
(s) to the cache isn't so emblazoned by 'social trail damage' as it <br/>
usually is (not that letterboxing is any better at avoiding this, <br/>
though, unfortunately). Uh oh--my secret's out now.<br/>
~~*~~<br/>
My letterboxing clues allow comment by visitors because the clues <br/>
are listed on our own website using a BBoard discussion board <br/>
format.  I'm fine with folks commenting on the boxes but every now &amp; <br/>
then I'll see posts that either disclose the solution to a mystery <br/>
box or the fact that a bonus box exists.  That is pretty upsetting.  <br/>
However, because it's my website and I can 'override' the comment <br/>
function I'm able to delete the spoiler or purge the info that <br/>
reveals the bit of mystery that is so vital to this hobby. If it's <br/>
listed in a different type of format the letterbox planter may not <br/>
have the flexibility to purge comments about their own boxes.  <br/>
That's when it crosses the line.<br/>

<br/>
I also love the photos that people include with their logs - back when I first started geocaching there was a family that appeared headless in all their photos (photoshop touch-up, the didn't actually decapitate themselves). I thought was a creative and funny way to remain anonymous. <br/>
<br/>
When I hide a geocache I anxiously await that first finder post. I'm a feedback fan. The more feedback the better. :)<br/>

   I'm sure there some geocachers who don't care about logs. There  are some geocachers that never post. They just find. I bet there are  geocachers that find and never sign the paper log. But the site allows  for all types, those who like to post and those who don't. Those who  write a short essay about their hiking experience and include photos  and those who just write "found it". <br/>

But does it allow a placer to turn off comments completely if they <br/>
do not wish for this on their placement?  If not, then it may be <br/>
allowing for all types of "finders" as you say, but not really <br/>
taking into consideration the wishes of all types of "placers."  In <br/>
my opinion, a placer should have more control of their placement <br/>
than a finder.<br/>
<br/>
As a finder, I have the option of whether or not to read the <br/>
comments of those who went before me, and if I don't want to know <br/>
anything about the box before I go, I don't read them.  Easy <br/>
enough.  But as a placer, if I don't wish for there to be public <br/>
comments or discussion on the box/cache I have planted, I should <br/>
have the option to disallow this without having to delete or encrypt <br/>
each individual log entry.<br/>

I think people have forgotten that letterboxing.org is for everyone, <br/>
not just what they'd personally like to see. <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure someone out there would love to have a spoilers section to <br/>
make it easier to find those danged mystery boxes.  How about a <br/>
pictures section with photos leading you every 5 feet until <br/>
you "find" the box.  That would make it so much easier for those who <br/>
don't have the time or want to expend the effort to figure out a <br/>
mystery.<br/>
<br/>
Wait, I think there already are websites out there like that!<br/>

It's not so much about the hassle  factor for me, I think it's more about a finder having to leave the  site to leave a comment or view comments. I think more people would  rather leave the comment on the clue page. So I'm going to try  something with my pages. I'll copy and paste comments I receive to the  end of the clue page. Although I think finders would probably like the  ability to do it themselves. Thanks for getting me to think of a work  around.<br/>

I don't think that's very fair. In most cases, people use LbNA or AQ<br/>
*because* it's too much of a hassle, expense, effort, and/or<br/>
technologoically too advanced for some people to do themselves.<br/>
Everyone could be required to host their own clues, organize the<br/>
ability to sort through their clues, and such, but most don't.<br/>
<br/>
And throwing ideas out there--they may stick or not stick--but ideas<br/>
are a wonderful thing. Without ideas, we'd still be living in caves<br/>
looking for the next insect to eat. =)<br/>
<br/>
Not that there's anything wrong with being a caveman--lest any cavemen<br/>
on this list be insulted--but I like to live a cushy life myself. =)<br/>

I think you can receive feed back from 'Contact the Placer'. Once <br/>
received you can cut and paste into your clues. This chatlist and <br/>
others can be used for the same thing. That would be a very simple <br/>
way to post the notes you may receive and not have the procedure be <br/>
something that would have to be disabled for others that do not wish <br/>

I like the Contact the Placer feature since it allows individual <br/>
feedback.  I generally send a message to the Placer for every box we <br/>
look for.  I enjoy getting messages from people who have looked for my <br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I like the Status logging feature since it has given us more feedback <br/>
on our boxes (since not everyone takes the time to send a message). <br/>
When we get a "Found" status we assume the box is in OK condition.  If <br/>
we get an "Attempted", we know someone had difficulty finding it.  We <br/>
may then check on the status of the box ourselves, but are more likely <br/>
to do so if someone actually send us a message describing where they <br/>
were.  In looking for boxes, if we see several "Attempted", we may <br/>
still look for the box but aren't as surprised/disappointed if we don't <br/>
find it.  (Flip side is that we are elated if we DO find it!).  One of <br/>
the best parts of the logging feature is that it allows us to "hide" <br/>
boxes we have found (which would also be accomplished by using <br/>
the "Ignore" flag).  This gives us a much smaller list to consider when <br/>
planning an LB outing.<br/>
<br/>
However I am someone that would NOT be in favor of a public comment <br/>
logging feature.  I like the surprise of letterboxing and don't want to <br/>
read details about the stamp, hiding location, etc. prior to searching <br/>
for a box.<br/>

You obviously missed my point. Why should the concept of listing <br/>

exactly that. LbNA is a clue database. Why not just use the methods <br/>

Hmmm. Your post got me thinking. It's not so much about the hassle  factor<br/>
for me, I think it's more about a finder having to leave the  site to leave<br/>
a comment or view comments. I think more people would  rather leave the<br/>
comment on the clue page. So I'm going to try  something with my pages. I'll<br/>
copy and paste comments I receive to the  end of the clue page. Although I<br/>
think finders would probably like the  ability to do it themselves. Thanks<br/>
for getting me to think of a work  around.<br/>

How about a<br/>
pictures section with photos leading you every 5 feet until<br/>
you "find" the box.  That would make it so much easier for those who<br/>
don't have the time or want to expend the effort to figure out a<br/>
mystery.<br/>
