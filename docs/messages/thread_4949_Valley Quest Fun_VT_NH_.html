years ago, as I was working on my long-term project of hiking all the <br/>
side trails to the Appalachian Trail (since I'd already backpacked the <br/>
whole AT four times in the 1980's!),I dropped down the Hurricane Trail <br/>
to Dartmouth Outing Club's Moosilauke Ravine Lodge in NH, where I <br/>
found a pamphlet called Moosilauke Historical Quest in a rack in the <br/>
downstairs library. I followed the clues, but the box was so well <br/>
jammed-in that I didn't have enough interest at the time to work at <br/>
prying it out! (little did I know!) Instead, that "box clamantis in <br/>
deserto", which would have been my very first "letterbox", eventually <br/>
became my 498th, and several other Valley Quest boxes that I stumbled <br/>
onto while doing short nature walks in Southern Vermont (Springweather <br/>
and North Springfield Bog ) became my actual first "letterboxes" - and <br/>
are still among my favorites!<br/>
<br/>
After happily finding a few more quests locally, I made a little quest <br/>
in our backyard for my nephew and nieces, and then later Pete got me <br/>
the Valley Quest book as a birthday surprise! Meanwhile, Pete had <br/>
stumbled upon HIS first letterbox (one of Jay's left out in the open <br/>
at Meadowwoods and long since gone missing), and only then did we make <br/>
the connection with "letterboxing"! So, it seems we personally really <br/>
do have to thank Valley Quest and Vital Communities for setting the <br/>
stage and putting us on the right path!  Hope many other letterboxers <br/>
also get the chance to enjoy these wonderful quests!<br/>

<br/>
I got a call from one of our board members the other day--<br/>
whose husband read the article in the in-flight mag at 30,000 feet--<br/>
and she was REALLY disappointed &amp; wishing that they could have <br/>
mentioned Valley Quest.  I told her it was o.k.<br/>
<br/>
I'll send her your email &amp; hopefully<br/>
that will make her feel better!<br/>
<br/>
