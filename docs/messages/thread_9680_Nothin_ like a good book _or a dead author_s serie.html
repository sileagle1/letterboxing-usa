After multiple days of cold, rainy/icy weather when we could do nothing but <br/>
huddle inside and read a good book (I'm glad we didn't lose our power for <br/>
more than a moment of two -- get up reset the clocks --click-- get up reset <br/>
the clocks....) team BeMa headed out to recapture our dignity by finding the <br/>
two missed Dead Author's Series boxes (we were not yet confident enough to <br/>
take on Froggy again!...).  We avoided the muddy parts of the path (at least <br/>
the older ones did, the younger BeMa's tromped right through it and then <br/>
headed for the beige carpet at home...), back across the rickety bridge and <br/>
found the fallen tree after the T.  We realized that we were looking on the <br/>
wrong side of the path our first time out!!!  (ooops!)  We figured to the <br/>
right as you are looking ahead (it's to the right of the T path).  No wonder <br/>
we were all confused about following it up the hill!  As the little BeMa's <br/>
would say (though we ask them not to) "DUH!"  O.K.  so that didn't stop us <br/>
from looking under the wrong perpendicular tree and then too far down <br/>
towards the end...  We really worked for this one and in the end we found <br/>
it!!  Yah!  We feel a lot better now!!<br/>
<br/>
Then, onto the next in the series.  The hollies were much easier to spot in <br/>
the winter as they are the only green.  And then the cute little pine tree.  <br/>
Thank you for the help Mary!  We liked the box under the rock.  We've been <br/>
having a hard time with leaves and sticks lately!<br/>
<br/>
Littlest BeMa had a hard time understanding that if a stamp is very long and <br/>
one's notebook page is not, the stamp will not fit unless you turn it <br/>
lengthwise.  We went through a couple of sheets of paper (all of which came <br/>
back out with us -- important teaching moment about litter and having hissy <br/>
fits in a public space...)  But all's well that ends well!  There was even <br/>
someone else with a pretty rainbow stamp pad!<br/>
<br/>
What a nice way to end the weekend and enjoy one of the rare warm days we're <br/>
going to get this winter!<br/>
<br/>
Froggy -- watch out -- we're coming for you next!! :0)<br/>
