                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a report a while back that 'Order In The Court' and 'Jackson<br/>
County Pride' might possibly be missing. I'm happy to report that<br/>
both are alive and well although a little lonely. Last person to<br/>
stampin in either box was the legendary Wanda from RI on Labor Day.<br/>
Status has been updated on the clues and clues for 'Court' have been<br/>
modified slightly for clarification.<br/>
<br/>
On a slightly different matter - I know several of our 'Legends of<br/>
Jackson County' boxes have been found at least once but has anyone<br/>
found 'Big Jim?' Inquiring minds would like to know. :-)<br/>
