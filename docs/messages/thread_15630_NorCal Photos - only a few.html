<br/>
For those like Buzzard seeking accomodations in the San Luis Obispo <br/>
area, I suggest you write me offlist with the TYPE of place you are <br/>
looking for. Kind of give me an idea of the price range, etc. I will <br/>
do my best to respond to those inquiries.<br/>
<br/>
Camp out info I posted earlier but will try to repost it to you if <br/>
that is what you are looking for. Motels run from $34 to several <br/>
hundred dollars a night around here. <br/>
<br/>
Keep that cheese off the fire,<br/>
Sir B<br/>
