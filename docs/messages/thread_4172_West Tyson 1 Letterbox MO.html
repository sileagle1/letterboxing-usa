After spending a year hidden behind rocks in the woods the West Tyson 1 <br/>
geocache stash has been retired. The box is still in the same location, <br/>
however, as it is now a letter box and will be maintained by Mohmers. Please <br/>
visit www.letterboxing.org or send an email to letterbox-usa@egroups.com for <br/>
more information. As with my Greensfelder_1 cache, it was nice to see the <br/>
surrounding area apparently unaffected by the travelers that searched for <br/>
this stash. Thanks to everyone that visited. --Dan<br/>
<br/>
 To see past e-logs go to this site:   <br/>
http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.asp?ID=347<br/>
<br/>
Since it is archived as a geocache you might have to login to the web site.<br/>

Oops, I meant to say the stash would be retired on the weekend of January <br/>
12/13. That would make it almost exactly a year old. Wow!<br/>
