and Chris.<br/>
We picked up all of the temporary event stamps, got a ton of <br/>
exchanges (Thanks All), and even logged a few Hitchhikers.<br/>
Also we found the new permanent "Billings Barn" box (This is a great <br/>
stamp, Jay!!) and one we had missed last time we where here "Fertile <br/>
Frond".<br/>
Finding "Sister Road, Sister Town" in the dark with Wanda &amp; Pete, <br/>
Music Women, LetterBoxer2002, and Moonstone Baby was a great treat <br/>
and our son Ryan was thrilled. We found the following Sunday, "A <br/>
Little Butterfly", "North Camp", "Fallen Leaves" (A very nice <br/>
trail), "Carolina North", "Carolina South", and finally found "Frosty <br/>
Drew". We picked up the "Swift Passage" HH at "Carolina South" and <br/>
will give it a good home next week.  <br/>

Being mentioned in a news article is going to make Ryan so happy!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for the news about Swift Passage. What a treat to know it has <br/>
made it all the way to New England, where I grew up! Releasing Hitch Hikers <br/>
is a little bit like sending a piece of yourself out into the world. It's always good <br/>
to hear that it's still alive and traveling.<br/>
