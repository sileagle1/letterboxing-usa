Difficult (Steep Hills)      Planted By The NeeDeeps 3-16-03<br/>
Directions: From RT. 44 West or From RT.101 East turn onto RT.169<br/>
North.Go down 169 and go past Day RD. 0.1 of a mile there will be a pull<br/>
off area on your right,pull in and park.Walk up the path and go around<br/>
the green gate and head down the airline.As you walk along notice it<br/>
drops off on each side of the airline if you listen you can here the Day<br/>
Brook running down below.Keep walking down the line and soon you will<br/>
come to a path that goes off to the left, you will also see a trail map<br/>
on a tree,go down the path (Steep Hill).There will be posts with yellow<br/>
rope to hold on to going down, once down the hill the trail goes down a<br/>
small embankment and then turns to the right.Soon the trail will bend<br/>
back to the left and you will go down yet another hill with poles and<br/>
yellow guide rope. at the bottom you will come to a small stream cross<br/>
over and go straight through a couple of pine trees, then the trail will<br/>
loop around to the left and you will come to a beautiful wooden bridge<br/>
will a bench on it, sit and relax for awhile and watch the Day Brook<br/>
running underneth you.Once you have rested continue on when you step off<br/>
the bridge you will notice another trail map on a tree.Look off in a<br/>
distance at the stone tunnel going under the airline for the brook to<br/>
run though.Now turn and go up the hill at the top you will notice on the<br/>
left a bird house on a tree,this tree also has three little sisters<br/>
growing from the base,directly behind that tree is a little stone wall.<br/>
In that wall behind stone doors is the Ohio State Stamp.To return go<br/>
back down the hill and cross back over the bridge,go back around the<br/>
loop to the small stream but this time do not cross over it instead<br/>
follow the trail to the right and soon you will cross over two smaller<br/>
bridges.Then the trail will bend to the left and you will go up a steep<br/>
hill with posts and yellow guide rope, once you reach the top you will<br/>
go left and then take a right back on the trail you came down. Follow<br/>
back up to the airline then turn right and walk the line back to your<br/>
car.(DO NOT SUGGEST DOING WITH SNOW AND ICE ON THE GRUOND).have fun The<br/>
