                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I first started carving last year, I found that the easiest method was<br/>
to make a copy at Kinko's, place the image face down on the rubber and heat<br/>
it for a few seconds with an iron. It created a beautifully detailed<br/>
transfer that could be handled without smears.<br/>
<br/>
However, lately that method has resulted in nothing being transfered to the<br/>
rubber. I tried the Acetone method with the same results. I even tried a<br/>
T-shirt transfer, but couldn't get it hot enough without melting the rubber.<br/>
At my wits end and with some very intricate stamp images just begging to be<br/>
carved, I talk to the people at Kinkos.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, they have changed their ink. It's now oil based and sealed to<br/>
the paper. This prevents the ink from sticking to other sheets of paper or<br/>
plastic covers (like it used to when put in a binder). "Archive safe" I<br/>
think they call it now.<br/>
<br/>
Solution: I went to the library and used their ancient copier and VOILA! A<br/>
perfect image transfer, just like I used to get. So, if you have tried the<br/>
'heat transfer' method and it didn't work, you may need to use an older<br/>
copier. By the way, I'm using PZ Cut and I'm still using the original batch,<br/>
so I knew that wasn't what had changed :-) New and more intricate stamps are<br/>
on the way to boxes in Cincinnati!<br/>
