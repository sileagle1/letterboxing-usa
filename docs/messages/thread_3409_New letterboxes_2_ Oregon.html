Early this evening we enjoyed finding both your letterboxes at the <br/>
Fernhill Wetlands.  We saw many blue herons and great egrets in the <br/>
process, which added all the more to our experience.  You definately <br/>
picked a nice site and hope others will share in the experience too.<br/>
<br/>
Warmest Regards,<br/>
