Since I am primarily interested in new boxes in Michigan, but am <br/>
interested in seeing the others when time permits, I set myself up to <br/>
receive individual e-mails from the announce list and then set up two <br/>
folders in my Outlook Inbox -- one for boxes in MI and one for boxes <br/>
in all other states.  I made two different rules for incoming mail <br/>
from the announce list to direct them to one or the other folder, <br/>
depending on if the box is in Michigan or not.<br/>
<br/>
This way the messages from the announce list don't clog up my primary <br/>
e-mail Inbox.  Furthermore, sending the messages to two separate <br/>
folders prevents the Michigan boxes from getting buried in all the <br/>
others, but stills allows me to check them out as I get time.  If you <br/>
want to receive only the messages about boxes in your own state, you <br/>
could do something similar except instead of sending the other states <br/>
to a second folder, just send them to the trash.<br/>

<br/>
The new LbNA web site:<br/>

http://letterboxing.wesgarrison.us/<br/>
<br/>
The new lbox-announce Yahoo group:<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lbox-announce/<br/>
<br/>
The option "announce this new box on the e-mail list" is the very <br/>
last thing when you are adding a new box at the new LbNA site.<br/>
