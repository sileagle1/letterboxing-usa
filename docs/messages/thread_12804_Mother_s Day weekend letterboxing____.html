                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had the nicest weekend... On Saturday I went to Porter Preserve on <br/>
Barter's Island, ME and found shipwright's three boxes. I also found a <br/>
surprise! The Anchors Away hitchhiker had made its way all the way up <br/>
from Key West. That was a fun morning walk, and the weather was <br/>
gorgeous. Later that day I went to Brunswick for a movie, so I stopped <br/>
by Thopsam to visit the Best Friends box. It's pretty new, but I can't <br/>
believe I was the first to find it... it's a quickie to find but a fun <br/>
side trip.<br/>
<br/>
Then yesterday my Mother's Day treat was a day letterboxing with my <br/>
daughter Misha (lb name Brat, she's decided). We went to Skolfield <br/>
Preserve in Brunswick and visited the box there, then revisited the Best <br/>
Friends box, because I knew she'd like that one a lot! Then off the Wolf <br/>
Neck Woods in Freeport for the afternoon...<br/>
<br/>
We couldn't for the life of us find Osprey, I am not sure if it's still <br/>
there. We did find Salty Hemlock in great shape. The walk back was a bit <br/>
much, as we took a wrong trail (we had a map even) and ended up walking <br/>
forever.<br/>
<br/>
Then we decided to go back the way we came and go to Harpswell to find <br/>
the box there. Long drive, nice rocky beach. We searched and searched <br/>
but after an hour and a half called it quits for the day. The clues, <br/>
through strightforward enough, stumped me and I just could't get it right.<br/>
<br/>
So, fun day! We also released Anchors Away near a mystery box (Maine Wolf).<br/>
<br/>
It was great. Now I am plotting and planning a trip to Acadia later this <br/>
summer for a long weekend. I think the next ones we tackle will be more <br/>
local though.<br/>
