Hi,<br/>
My Girl Scout Troop wants to find these letterboxes when they are out<br/>
of school next week.  Can anyone tell me if they are still there or<br/>
should we go elsewhere and not take up the time.  They were placed<br/>
quite awhile ago.  We will have a girl new to letterboxing with us<br/>
and don't want to disappoint her on the first try.  Thank-you.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just spoke with a regional Girl Scouts Director about this same <br/>
prospect earlier today.  This is the info I gave to her for an <br/>
upcoming event here in the Pac NW...<br/>
<br/>
Least expensive materials out there:<br/>
<br/>
Carving medium:  EZ Kut purchased via art supply store online (Dick <br/>
Blick's?)--cut large sheet in individual smaller pieces for stamps--<br/>
a rather large sheet runs about $5 plus S&amp;H for about 8"x16" (I <br/>
think)--this will make a WHOLE BUNCH of stamps if you cut it up--I <br/>
don't even think dollar store erasers can beat this price<br/>
<br/>
Containers:  small food storage containers purchased at a dollar <br/>
store or used small food storage containers (thoroughly cleaned <br/>
before using) found at a thrift shop  (I've found a couple dozen <br/>
tupperware sandwich containers for about $2 TOTAL at our local St <br/>
Vincent de Paul 'plasticware's last stand' store)<br/>
<br/>
Logbooks:  purchased in bulk via www.orientaltrading.com  do a <br/>
search on 'notebook' and you'll be amazed at the results, usually <br/>
unruled/unperforated tablets work best--I think you can get about <br/>
108 notebooks for $30 plus S&amp;H?  There are smaller packages but that <br/>
seemed to be the best 'bang for your buck' if you're looking at a <br/>
large group of participants...<br/>
<br/>
Carving tools:  don't know any better readily available carving tool <br/>
except for the Speedball linoleum cutter/carving tool available at <br/>
Michaels and other arts/craft stores in the area (this will be the <br/>
most expensive purchase)<br/>
<br/>
A Boy Scout troop in our region used letterboxing as an event to <br/>
help the Scouts 'fly up' to the next level of scouting about a year <br/>
and a half ago (Kennedy Creek letterboxes near Olympia, WA).  <br/>
Instead of placing new boxes, veteran LBers in the region placed <br/>
letterboxes specifically for the event.  The clues focused on <br/>
orienteering/navigation, puzzle solving, plant identification, <br/>
situational/environmental awareness, etc.  It was a big hit with the <br/>
scouts!!!  Hopefully, they learned something in the process, too!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

I think it's not a bad idea to make 'Introductory' or 'starter' boxes for them, with appropriate stamps, in a known, private area, for learning purposes.  Orienteering is great fun!<br/>
    The KISS rule (Keep It Simple, Scout - er - -that's a little re-writing) is fine for an 'Intro' course, so using the garden-variety erasers is not only easy on you, it shows people of all income levels that they can do neat things like make stamps for next to no money.  No one gets embarrased or bummed because they don't get an allowance and can't get the sheets of material.  Plus, if/when they make mistakes, it's not a budget-burner to try again.<br/>

Here's some info you might find useful:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/PLGS/<br/>
<br/>
It's a handout and other info for a letterboxing class that I taught to <br/>
girl scout leaders at a training conference this past winter (targeted at <br/>
teaching them about letterboxing so they could then teach their scouts). I <br/>
gave each attendee a "kit" made up of supplies that I got mostly from <br/>
dollar stores -- a pack of plastic erasers, an x-acto style hobby knife, a <br/>
piece of tracing paper, stamp pad, a piece of fun foam and materials to <br/>
make a small journal, all in a waterproof Rubbermaid-style container.<br/>
<br/>
We covered the material in the handout in 90 minutes -- plus made journals <br/>
and carved stamps, so it was a real whirlwind. The carved images from their <br/>
stamps are on that page, too, so you can see the results of their fast and <br/>
furious first efforts at carving.<br/>
<br/>
For younger kids, I recommend Bob Prager's tutorial on making stamps from <br/>
fun foam (also developed as part of a girl scouts program):<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/pragerr/SkylandLetterboxing/stampmaking.html<br/>
<br/>
(BTW, I'll be repeating the class at another Girl Scouts training <br/>
conference this fall, so if anyone has any suggestions or ideas for <br/>
improving the materials, please let me know!)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

means, but it works. They can also make their own log books, which <br/>
may cut down on buying them...? <br/>
<br/>
I'm racking up cheap ideas because I'll be introducing LB to my <br/>

Hey there,<br/>
<br/>
We've been working on hiding letterboxes in our Girl Scout camps for Scouts only.  To <br/>
start out and to prove to the council that this won't be too tough on the site, we're going <br/>
to be hiding at our council sponsored daycamp and will make the clues available to the <br/>
older girl units.  We're not even discussing letterboxing at that point, just having the girls <br/>
do a "treasure hunt" for a rubber stamp, but we're hoping to expand into a similar <br/>
situation that you're describing.<br/>
<br/>
We were planning dollar store erasers since they're so ubiqitous, but I'm also interested in <br/>
any answers you receive!<br/>
