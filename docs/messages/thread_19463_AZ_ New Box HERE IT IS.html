Pull off I-40 at its junction with Historic Route 66 and make a beeline for Delgadillo's <br/>
Snow-Cap Drive In, an icon on the Mother Road.  If you've never visited before you are in <br/>
for a real treat and an easy drive-by letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
After getting your milkshake and spending some time exploring the folk art garden at the <br/>
rear of the restaurant, go to the backside of the southernmost fence where the dumpsters <br/>
are.  About 10 paces east from the blacktop is a pile of four stones, three tan and one <br/>
white.  I think they're holding up the fence, but they also hide your letterbox!  You will <br/>
know you are in the right place if the stones are in alignment with the airplane whirligig.<br/>
<br/>
Now, let me explain the stamp image. Someone had already placed a letterbox at Joseph <br/>
City, AZ at the Jackrabbit Trading Post where the famous "Here it is" sign resides.  My <br/>
cconnection to this area is that many locations along this stretch of the Mother Road were <br/>
featured heavily in a recent series of my paintings. The stamp image is also a figure that is <br/>
used in a lot of my printmaking work, so it is serving as a way of leaving a little bit of <br/>
myself behind, in a place I truly love, for the time being.  Someday I'll be back and carve a <br/>
more specific stamp for the Snow Cap (or you can), but for now, "Here it is!"<br/>
<br/>
I'll appreciate hearing from you after you find the box!<br/>
