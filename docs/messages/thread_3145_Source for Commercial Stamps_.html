Looking at the LbNA site, it says somewhere that a 2x3" commercially made<br/>
rubber stamp should cost about $10. Around Scottsdale AZ, they are quoting<br/>
me $33-$35 for this. They haven't seen the art - I just told them it's line<br/>
art with some type.<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody have clues on where to get these stamps made for $10 or so? I'm<br/>
going to Kinkos and another quick-print place for prices.<br/>
