                    <div class="plaintext-content">In pioneer days, when a new family moved to an area<br/>
the neighbors got together and built a barn for them<br/>
in one day.  After the work was done, they all<br/>
gathered to get to know one another with a meal and<br/>
good fellowship.  In similar spirit, we in Texas<br/>
intend to gather on October 22nd in an area that is<br/>
sparsely populated with letterboxes (and until a month<br/>
ago had none!) and seed boxes for those letterboxers<br/>
already there and for those yet to come.   And after<br/>
the work is done, we will gather for a potluck meal<br/>
and fellowship, then part and box our ways home.<br/>
<br/>
Johnson, Ellis, and Navarro counties (JEN) are located<br/>
just south of Dallas and Tarrant Counties and<br/>
currently have four boxes between them and one known<br/>
boxer.  Nestled between more heavily box-populated<br/>
areas, there will certainly be new boxers in the near<br/>
future and we hope to leave behind an area with<br/>
well-placed boxes for them to enjoy.   <br/>
<br/>
The gathering will be based out of Waxahachie in Ellis<br/>
County.   Maps and local information on the counties<br/>
will be available at the gathering site for those who<br/>
need additional information once they are there. <br/>
Additionally, Ive set up a webpage with basic<br/>
gathering information and with information about the<br/>
area to be seeded to assist in planning boxes to be<br/>
placed.  Im updating it every time I get an<br/>
opportunity to do some research.<br/>
<br/>
This gathering isnt just for Texans, but for anyone<br/>
with a pioneering spirit and a passion for seeing new<br/>
areas populated with boxes.  Anyone who likes the idea<br/>
but is unable to attend is invited to send a box to be<br/>
planted by someone else!<br/>
