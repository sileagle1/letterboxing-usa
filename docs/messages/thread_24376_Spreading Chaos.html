Inspector,<br/>
<br/>
I would not normally feel I need to point out my own manners, but it seems<br/>
you have a habit of overlooking clear indications of good manners, so I<br/>
thought that rather than making you muddle through my own exhibition of<br/>
courtesy, I would help you and point it out.<br/>
<br/>
I would apologize if that was presumptuous of your obtuseness except that my<br/>
only motivation was to help you in that respect.<br/>

<br/>
Your investigative techniques in this case bewilder me with their <br/>
lack of direction and logic.  When all else fails, put the chick on <br/>
a spit, add a can of beer and turn up the heat -- not that you are <br/>
the first to have resorted to such fowl methods of desperation.  Why <br/>
it was not that long ago that photos were passed around of the chick <br/>
on the rotisserie, along with a tasty roasting recipe.<br/>
<br/>
While it is true that I have engineered and participated in a number <br/>
of joint letterboxing schemes employing the efforts of letterboxing <br/>
friends from across the country, I wouldn't dream of taking <br/>
advantage of my trusted cohorts -- er, comrades, to pull them into a <br/>
scheme such as the theft of the Store of Good Manners.  It is simply <br/>
unreasonable and illogical that I or my usual allies, many of whom <br/>
have themselves been held suspect in this atrocious crime, would <br/>
wish harm upon an institution which promotes many of the same <br/>
philosophies that we do.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, I find your logic regarding the fact that I often hike <br/>
alone, to be faulty. All the more, I would hope that my fellow <br/>
letterboxers would have taken the time to browse through the Store <br/>
of Good Manners and have taken to heart what they have found there. <br/>
There is nothing more disheartening to a letterboxer than to hike 8 <br/>
miles to a coveted box only to find that it was not properly closed <br/>
by the previous finder and is now full of muddy debris.  As a lone <br/>
letterboxer this is especially frustrating as there is nobody else <br/>
to reach into the slimy mess to rescue the stamp and logbook!<br/>
<br/>
While the good inspector has the discernment to see that my <br/>
intentions are generally well-meaning, unfortunately there are those <br/>
who would not agree. I am forever having to endure claims of elitism <br/>
and criticism from my critics in regards to mystery letterboxes -- <br/>
both my affinity for them and my staunch refusal to share clues that <br/>
I have so diligently deciphered.  It seems that there are those <br/>
among us who do not consider it a breech of etiquette to share <br/>
solutions and location information to mystery letterboxes!  As one <br/>
with the utmost respect for the likes of Mapsurfer, Legerdemaine and <br/>
the previously accused Der Mad Stamper, and as one who immensely <br/>
enjoys finding and planting mystery boxes, I am appalled at such <br/>
indiscretion and disrespect!<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, I find it disheartening that mystery boxes, which at <br/>
one time were coveted by letterboxers across the country, now <br/>
languish in their hiding places with nary a visitor a year, simply <br/>
because a little brainwork is involved in finding them.  Why, I <br/>
recently pulled one of my mystery boxes, planted along the historic <br/>
Route 66, which had been in place for several years and had seen <br/>
only a handful of visitors. What is at the root of this deplorable <br/>
phenomenon?  That mystery boxes, once the dessert on the <br/>
letterboxing buffet, command so little interest?  Is it a fear of <br/>
the unknown or just plain letterboxing laziness (no offense of <br/>
course, to the Lazy Letterboxer, who has herself deciphered and <br/>
found several of these coveted gems)?  So intent am I that <br/>
letterboxers enjoy these treasures and unravel mystery clues on <br/>
their own, I have conducted a workshop designed to provide insight <br/>
and tools for solving ciphers, codes, cryptograms, logic puzzles and <br/>
other clue craftiness.  Give a letterboxer a mystery box solution <br/>
and he obtains a coveted stamp, but teach him how to decipher clues <br/>
and he scores mystery boxes for a lifetime (or something like that).<br/>
<br/>
Just the other day my dear friend and fellow Great Lakes <br/>
Letterboxer, Speedsquare, and I found ourselves in discussion about <br/>
this atrocity of loose-lipped letterboxers, among other things <br/>
related to the course letterboxing has taken in recent years. I am <br/>
sure she would be willing to vouch for me and my letterboxing ethics.<br/>
<br/>
In a resent post the esteemed Ms. Emily Post chided you for ruffling <br/>
feathers, well, you have ruffled mine indeed, but I assure you that <br/>
you are roasting the wrong chick.  I await your apology at such <br/>
accusation.<br/>

<br/>
Have all your arteries been so clogged with cholesterol that fresh blood to your brain is <br/>
hindered?<br/>
<br/>
I have been keeping an eye on you since you entered our great little group surrounding <br/>
the Great Lakes.  You are our newest member and we welcome you no differently than we <br/>
welcome others.  Our fearless leader and #1 Letterboxing mentor will not be with us every <br/>
day this summer; she promised to check in from time to time.  Her absence should not be <br/>
interpreted as suspicious mystery; she notified us that she had other pressing <br/>
responsibilities.<br/>
<br/>
Spring Chick is far from being suspect in this heinous crime, the theft of the Store of Good <br/>
Manners.  The numerous files, links and databases at LbGLK will attest to the integrity and <br/>
leadership of Spring Chick.<br/>
<br/>
I have to agree with Spring Chick in her estimation of your logic in solving this mystery.  <br/>
You can't just throw out some gorilla glue and expect it to stick on the perpetrator of this <br/>
crime.  You'll have to dig deeper and hone those puzzle-solving techniques if you are to <br/>
play in the big time.  How long have you been solving mysteries?  How many hours, days, <br/>
weeks did the first one take you to crack?  I enjoy a good mystery, too.  When I can't get <br/>
outdoors to a letterbox, I get my fix watching a good TV crime story.  I can get those <br/>
solved fairly easily in 38 minutes.  The rest of the hour is just a bunch of blah, blah, blah <br/>
advertising.<br/>
<br/>
Surely, Mr. Bacon, you do not expect to discover the answer to this mystery by badgering a <br/>
puzzlemaster?  It is my belief Spring Chick would rather be drawn and quartered and <br/>
marinated than divulge a beloved mystery.  But the Store of Good Manners is not a <br/>
mystery; the only mystery is where they have been hiding.<br/>
<br/>
Let me share a personal example.  Some time ago, I needed a good place to hide a WOM <br/>
(word of mouth, if you need clarification) clue to a personal traveler of mine.  I needed an <br/>
accessible and discreet location.  I sneakily put the clue in one of SpringChick's hidden <br/>
clues files.  Do you think she broadcasted that to the group?  Absolutely not.  Do you think <br/>
anyone else found this little gem in the folder?  If they did, they didn't approach me to <br/>
receive their reward for sleuthing.  And now that little (green or purple) monster is retired.  <br/>
Is that not a perfect example of SpringChick's ethics?<br/>
<br/>
Are there any summer openings in Sleuthing 101?<br/>
