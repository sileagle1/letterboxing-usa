<br/>
&gt;Erica Bell<br/>

says <br/>
<br/>
&gt;Thank you, Graham, for those pickies!  I had a completely different idea<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;letterboxing UK style...I thought that everyone there was very solitary<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;secretive, and not willing to share or talk about their conquests.<br/>
<br/>
Well you can see we are <chuckle><br/>
<br/>
&gt;  This<br/>
&gt;was stressed in the famous Smithsonian article about the subject.  It's<br/>
&gt;nice to know that it's not all serious there!!<br/>
<br/>
What an outrageous  suggestion <g> <br/>
We are all very very serious <lol><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Those pictures were great...and what's all the beer memorobilia?  Pub<br/>
&gt;collecting, too?  Budweiser mats, Beck's hats, etc...<br/>
<br/>
Beer ?  Beer ! Oh no !!..No No !! ..Er hum ..Nothing to do with us <big<br>
grin&gt;....Its er um ..just because we hold our Meet in the ..er main bar..<br/>
of the Dartmoor Prison Officers Club...<br/>
&lt; 0:&gt;  &gt;  <br/>
<br/>
{er what is the emoticon for "butter wouldn't melt in my mouth" sorta look<br/>
?}<br/>
<br/>
Actually we take over all of the club, its dinning room, its exhibition<br/>
room, its stage , its kitchen (well we have to eat !) its car park (lot)<br/>
is covered with trade stalls for equipment, hand made boxers equipment,<br/>
compasses, inks, cutting stuff, posting cards, stamps..hand knitted raw<br/>
woolly hats (eh!) ..you name it...Even the air rescue helicopter team turn<br/>
up !  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for posting these...they were fun on a Monday morning!<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks..it's even more fun on the weekend of The Meet...You can<br/>
hardly move for mad boxers. <br/>
<br/>
Princetown is a tiny village with one (big) employer..A Government<br/>
"hotel"..We boxers boost the town population by about 500% ! for two days<br/>
a year (madness).<br/>
<br/>
It is a crazy place...Can't think why I go , being a solitary and<br/>
secretive boxer that I am ! <grin><br/>
