                    <div class="plaintext-content">After nine months of letterboxing in MI, IL, OH, PA, NJ and DE, I <br/>
have finally gotten an exchange!  Actually two exchanges, two days in <br/>
a row!<br/>
<br/>
Sunday while at Saugatuck Dunes checking "Old Man Winter" and <br/>
placing "Spring Fling," I came upon an elderly woman standing alone <br/>
next the trail, looking anxiously from one side to the other.  I <br/>
remembered passing her earlier on the trail and she had not been <br/>
alone.  Since she happened to be standing at the precise spot where <br/>
one would enter the woods in pursuit of another letterbox at this <br/>
park, I glanced into the woods, and sure enough there was the rest of <br/>
her party stamping into the box!  It was a first all-around, as Dave, <br/>
Lydia, Scott and Kristen (and guard Oma) were not only stamping into <br/>
the "First Letterbox on the Lake" (by Rainbow's End), but it was <br/>
their first ever letterbox find, and an exchange first for all of <br/>
us!  So welcome to these newbies from West Michigan!<br/>
<br/>
Still on the high of actually meeting other letterboxers on the <br/>
trail, OldShoe and I set out on Monday for the "Beach View by the <br/>
Dunes," another Rainbow's End box, located at Warren Dunes State Park <br/>
in Sawyer, MI.  After what must have been at least 3 miles of up and <br/>
down those dreadful Michigan sand dunes, we were nearing the end of <br/>
the clues, and passed a man and a woman looking for something in the <br/>
woods.  The thought crossed our mind that they may be letterboxers, <br/>
but we continued on to the next landmark without saying anything and <br/>
found the box nestled in its hiding spot along the edge of the <br/>
beach.  As we sat a little way down the beach stamping in, we saw the <br/>
man and woman we had passed earlier pointing to the steel pole and <br/>
making a bee-line for the box hiding spot!  OldShoe went and asked <br/>
them if they were looking for the box...  Sure enough!  More <br/>
letterboxers!  Turns out it was also their very first letterbox, and <br/>
I'm sorry that we had the box out and they didn't get that thrill of <br/>
seeing that first box hiding in its spot!  But, it was nice to meet <br/>
more boxers...  so welcome also to OldSoul and YoungHeart from <br/>
Chicago, IL.<br/>
<br/>
On Tuesday we headed over to pick up Matt the Rat's Chicago Portage <br/>
box, wondering if we could make it a sweep...  We found the box, safe <br/>
and sound, but no other letterboxers at this one!<br/>
<br/>
Ahhh, there is finally a number behind that lonely little "X."  Oh, <br/>
but Doug, you're not off the hook for that cup of coffee...  the more <br/>
exchanges the merrier!<br/>

Actually, since they were new, they didn't all have their own stamps <br/>
yet.  The first group was sharing one stamp, and the couple on the <br/>
second day also shared one stamp.  But hey, I'm happy with 2 <br/>
exchanges.  And thrilled to see more folks from the upper midwest <br/>
getting involved in the hobby!<br/>
