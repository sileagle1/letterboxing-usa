  We are going to NYC tomorrow and I had wanted to look for the Troll in <br/>
Central Park again.  I have looked for the clues and they are no longer posted.  <br/>
Does anyone know if it is still there?  Are there clues anywhere out there?<br/>
<br/>
  Also does anyone know if there are any other letterboxes in NYC?  I saw <br/>
that there may be a hitchhiker but I'm not sure if someone already picked that <br/>
up.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

It was reported missing and the owner of the box is out of the country.<br/>
