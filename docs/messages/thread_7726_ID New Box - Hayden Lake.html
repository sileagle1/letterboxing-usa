letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
Hayden Lake Letterbox<br/>
Nearest Town: Hayden, ID<br/>
County: Kootenai<br/>
Difficulty: Easy Drive By<br/>
<br/>
On the East side of Hayden Lake, near Mokins Bay, there lives a new<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Find the road that circumnavigates the lake.   Start on the West side of the<br/>
lake, and travel clockwise.  Enjoy the views along the lake - but be<br/>
careful - the road twists and winds along, and there are opportunities to<br/>
view the lake from a very "up close and personal" viewpoint if you're not<br/>
driving carefully!  Watch for wildlife along this road too.  We've observed<br/>
Turkeys, Moose, Bald Eagles, and Osprey here before.  There are also bear<br/>
and an occasional Cougar.<br/>
<br/>
When you come to the entrance to Camp MiVoden, turn around - you've gone too<br/>
far.  Backtrack about 1/4 mile to find Mokins Bay Rd. on your right.  Park<br/>
here and place the Mokins Bay Road sign to your back.  Take 16 paces (32<br/>
steps) to "IS&amp;W".  Stay on the same side of the road as "IS&amp;W" and take 24<br/>
1/2 paces (49 steps) Northeast.   Look for an obvious hiding place.  ( I had<br/>
compass headings for the clues but I found out later my flux gate compass<br/>
wasn't calibrated.  I'll add compass bearings soon.)<br/>
