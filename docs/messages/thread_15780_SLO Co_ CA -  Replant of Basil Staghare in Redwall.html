<br/>
Ms. JugglerMouse has recarved Basil Staghare and we (Ash Raven, JM, <br/>
and yours truly) replanted him today. This time we are using a PVC <br/>
pipe with screw caps on both ends. Hope to keep the vermin out this <br/>
time. You will need to recheck the clues because the real life bunny <br/>
has moved.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you coming up to our October 4th event, JugglerMouse and <br/>
I sincerely hope you will:<br/>
<br/>
* Plant some boxes up here, too.<br/>
<br/>
* Let us know what kind of accomedations you are looking for (motel, <br/>
camp out, under a bridge somewhere, whatever)<br/>
<br/>
* Let us know how many to expect. We are trying to have at least hot <br/>
dogs and Kraft singles for those who wish to partake. If you are a <br/>
veggie, let us know, too.<br/>
<br/>
* And even if you decide to come up at the last minute, that is fine. <br/>
We want you to come up here. <br/>
<br/>
Keep on boxing out there,<br/>
Sir B, JugglerMouse, Ash Raven<br/>
