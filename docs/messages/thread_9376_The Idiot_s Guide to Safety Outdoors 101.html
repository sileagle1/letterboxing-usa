&gt;A couple of months ago we were out looking for a box in Northern VA.  My<br/>

&gt;until yesterday, when I finally found that web in an encyclopedia.  It was <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;black widow's web.<br/>
&gt;Usually I remind the boys not to reach in with their hands first, to use a<br/>
&gt;long stick to make sure they won't be disturbing anything living or that<br/>
&gt;there isn't glass or something else dangerous sharing the hiding place with<br/>
&gt;the box.  This time they were excited and I didn't think about it but what <br/>

Yeah, I find that it works well if at the beginning of the hunt I help my guys each find a "walking stick" and then they love to poke and whack things with it anyway. </body></html>

Hello,<br/>
<br/>
People should also be on the lookout for ticks. I picked up my own <br/>
little "Hitchhiker" last weekend in MA and <br/>
<br/>
have to see my Dr. today because I'm feeling crummy and may have <br/>
Lyme  Disease. I thought they were only<br/>
<br/>
a summer problem in this part of the country but apparently not.<br/>

Yeah, ticks are really a problem in VA too and especially this last summer there were signs up in the Fairfax Co. parks warning about them.  Always check yourself, kids and pets after being out very carefully and if you find something that looks like a deer tick stick it in a small bottle and save it in case anyone gets sick.  Then you can take it to the doctor or vet with you to show them.  <br/>

My Blue Cricket is a three-year-old male and he has recently discovered the joy of whacking but has yet to learn its downsides.  The airspace in our house is sometimes full of potentially dangerous flying objects.  Fortunately, in the woods we can all run faster than he can....  Mother of Crickets</body></html>
