&gt; The DaVinci Code is trying to pass as non-fiction but is just<br/>
&gt; another heresy.  If you like things that tickle your ears then I suppose you<br/>
&gt; would find the DaVinci Code interesting.  Stories like the DaVinci Code are<br/>
&gt; as old as Christianity itself.  Another heresy that has captured people is<br/>
&gt; The Left Behind series is another one  that if you are not well read in<br/>
&gt; the truth will capture your attention.<br/>

I've got to agree there.  :o)  <br/>
<br/>
I have quite a few friends who have read those and actually believe they are <br/>
scripturally correct.  A neighbor of mine read them and was all worked up and <br/>
upset about her future and how she was living her life and what was going to <br/>
happen to her kids according to the Left Behind Book. So we sat down and <br/>
compared it to the Bible. Tim LaHaye did a great job of using his imagination.  We <br/>
found that most of the book was based on a few misapplied old testament and new <br/>
testament verses - not to say that my neighbor didn't have some work to do to <br/>
clean up her lifestyle. Obviously Jesus will return one day - but it won't be <br/>
a secret.<br/>
