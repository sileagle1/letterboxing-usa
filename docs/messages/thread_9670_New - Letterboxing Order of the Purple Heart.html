Letterboxing simply is nothing in that nature!  <br/>

always tell you that they were simply "doing their<br/>

probably very scary to the person as they were<br/>
happening they simply cannot compare with the sort of<br/>

Honor them if you must, but do it in another way- I'm<br/>

student, "What is a Purple Heart?" With a serious voice the child <br/>
answers, "Oh, I just saw that on the internet. It's when you get hurt <br/>
letterboxing!" Ughhhhh! Two members of my family were recipients of <br/>
the Purple Heart (WWII and Viet Nam). They did NOT get hurt <br/>
letterboxing. They were Killed, fighting to protect my right to <br/>
letterbox. Now that I have had a chance to vent, why don't we start a <br/>
new, creative thread? If you like the idea of honoring those wounded <br/>
while letterboxing, why don't we brainstorm some ideas for a new <br/>
stamp?<br/>

I suggest we call it Letterboxing Order of the Lilac Heart.  Or is <br/>

who have earned it.  I would like to believe it's due<br/>

all of us in the US.<br/>
<br/>
For those who think this is merely someone being PC-<br/>
please educate yourself by visiting this site:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.purpleheart.org/explanation.htm<br/>
<br/>
Take a look around this site which has a database of<br/>
some of the recipients of the Purple Heart.  It's not<br/>
a complete database, but maybe you'll find the name of<br/>
someone you know and, if the person is still alive,<br/>
maybe you can take the time to say "Thanks"<br/>
<br/>
http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~sebring/<br/>
<br/>
 Then do a search on any search engine to find the<br/>
stories of those who have earned the medal. <br/>
<br/>
 If that doesn't bring a tear to your eye and<br/>
greatfulness to your heart, please take the time out<br/>
of your busy letterboxing day to visit a VA hospital<br/>
and talk to the veterans there.  Maybe even say<br/>
"Thanks"- they certainly would appreciate that and<br/>
wouldn't think you PC at all.<br/>
<br/>
Is it really too much to ask for us to be grateful in<br/>
honoring something that George Washington thought was<br/>
important enough to honor?  Or are we really that self<br/>
centered in paralelling what injury we receive in<br/>
participating in a hobby with those who have fought to<br/>
keep us free?  I sure hope not!<br/>
<br/>
Alan- I'm sure your heart was in the right place.  I'm<br/>
sure you'll agree, though, that perhaps a Purple Shin<br/>
or Purple Bandaid, might be more in order.<br/>

At the risk of being labeled a "newby that flames"<br/>
I've GOT to respond to your recent post.  To imply that<br/>
those who don't share your view are ignorant is<br/>
ridiculous.  Such a charge is by far more ignorant<br/>
than any aspect of a purple heart letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
As kind as your intentions are, they miss<br/>
the fundamental point that this is a LETTERBOXING<br/>
list.  It isn't a list for the veterans administration.<br/>
It is a list for people who are interested in letterboxing.<br/>
Nothing more, nothing less.  Let's not forget that this is<br/>
a hobby - okay?<br/>
<br/>
Your insinuation that the purple heart letterbox erodes<br/>
the honor and dignity of those who sacrificed for the<br/>
country does more to undermine what the real purple heart<br/>
is than a letterbox ever could.<br/>
<br/>
So, my humble opinion is that if you get hurt while<br/>
letterboxing.  Don't request the letterbox.  There.  All<br/>
set.  Freewill being exercised in a free country.  Poetry.<br/>
<br/>
I for one will be proud to obtain the letterbox if I am ever<br/>
in the unenviable position of getting an infected mosquito<br/>
bite that turns into a nasty abrasion.  I promise, I will<br/>
neither apply for the State Veteran plates nor believe that<br/>
such an event somehow elevates me to the military honor<br/>
that is worn by the truly brave.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not ignorant, I'm not confused.  I just disagree.  And<br/>
As much as you may not appreciate that, I'm entitled.<br/>
Thats what all those brave souls who wear purple hearts<br/>
fought for - right?<br/>
<br/>
I'd also like to comment that the American Boxing association<br/>
is offended that we are using the word "boxing" in what is clearly<br/>
a non-pugilistic manner.  They have asked that we modify the<br/>
name of our hobby.  They are REALLY bent about it too.<br/>

We're close to "meltdown".  State your peace as often as you like in this<br/>
thread, but please note the keyword "peace".<br/>
<br/>
I have another idea.  How about something that commerates finding letterboxes <br/>
safely.  My idea is pretty simple, a box for F100, F500, and F5000 (and so on <br/>
for Pete and Wanda  :-)).  Especially since the Town Hall debacle on the <br/>
merit patches.  (Of course, for all I know this has already been done -- it<br/>
seems so obvious).<br/>
<br/>
The boxes would be cool -- they would collect stamps of people as they hit<br/>
the milestones in their logbooks.  And they would be in order, also (except <br/>
for the 100 for the most part, but we could work that out also.  It would be<br/>
cool for those who enjoy the numbers anyway -- and those who didn't could <br/>
choose to ignore these boxes, just as most do with mine :-)).<br/>
<br/>
I even have a vision for the artwork -- the lbna logo on the left, and a <br/>
big stylized number on the right, taking up about 75% of the image or so.<br/>
I'm not talented enough to pull off the artwork or I'd do it myself (I mean,<br/>
I'm ok when I take the time, which is rare, but I would want this job to<br/>
be first class) -- but I throw this out as an idea for anyone who wants to <br/>
do it.<br/>
<br/>

Notice, that the award was first given to Chuck, and no one spoke <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">No, Monica.  I spoke up when I first read the postings<br/>
about it- not, as you'd like to think, when your<br/>
sister won the "award".  I'm sure you didn't think<br/>
about that when you wrote.<br/>
<br/>
As far as McCarthyism or unAmercian- no, it's not<br/>
that, but I'm sure those who are so inclined will<br/>
think so. I was quite respectful in my asking that the<br/>
name of the box be changed and gave my reasons for it.<br/>
 It was only when charged with being "PC" and met with<br/>
such negative attitudes (which I expected- that<br/>
happens EVERYTIME I post something that someone<br/>
doesn't agree with)that I decided that it was time for<br/>
some to receive the education about what really was<br/>
behind my request.<br/>
<br/>
We have yet to hear from Alan.  We have yet to hear<br/>
from the military on the unauthorized use of their<br/>
medal in an unauthorized manner.  We have heard from<br/>
many who agree with me, as well.  I guess they can be<br/>
discounted?<br/>
<br/>
Oh well- I'm not surprised, just disappointed by the<br/>
total lack of respect for anything other than "fun".<br/>
