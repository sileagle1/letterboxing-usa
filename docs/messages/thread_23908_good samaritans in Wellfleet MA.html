                    <div class="plaintext-content">we go Hang gliding every Halloween on Cape COd<br/>
so it seemed appropriate to make our first plant <br/>
to commemorate 25+ wonderful years of flying<br/>
we planted our first LB last OCT/05 - DUNE FLYER<br/>
<br/>
we stopped last weekend to check on this little box<br/>
and everything was just fine<br/>
however....on wednesday we were back checking wind direction<br/>
and MAJOR construction vehicles were working<br/>
RIGHT WHERE THE DUNE FLYER WAS PLANTED!!!<br/>
yikes<br/>
with trepidation in our hearts <br/>
(like our first born you know)<br/>
we entered the area and found that <br/>
they had found the DUNE FLYER <br/>
and safely transported it to the public works dept office <br/>
and were going to contact us<br/>
they were wonderful<br/>
<br/>
we have temporarily changed the clues to indicate unavailable right <br/>
now...and will return next month and replace this LB<br/>
<br/>
but just wanted to share this HAPPY STORY<br/>
