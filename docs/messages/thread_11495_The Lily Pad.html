The Lily Pad is a very nice store in Willimantic owned for 21 years by<br/>
Peter Polomski.The store carries all kinds of stuff,like Art<br/>
Supplies,Custom Framing,Color Copies and yes letterboxing equipment like<br/>
carving kits,tracing paper and yes they have the pink rubber as well as<br/>
the white.The Lily Pad is a very friendly place hosted by the nicest<br/>
people you could ever meet. Hope you all get a chance to stop by. We<br/>
promis the stamp is worth the trip,and it would be a good chance to<br/>
stock up on supplies while you are there or just come in and stamp up<br/>
and say hi.<br/>
Directions: The Lily Pad is at 34 North Street in Willimantic but that<br/>
is a one way street.So we will get you there easy.From RT 66 in<br/>
Willimantic turn onto Church Street,go up to your second parking lot on<br/>
the left.It's called the Arthur W. Crosbie Municiple Parking Lot.Pull in<br/>
and drive to the other side of the lot and park.You will notice another<br/>
side street once you cross the parking lot that is North street. You can<br/>
now see The Lily Pad.Be careful crossing North ST. and enter the<br/>
store.Go in a little ways and turn the corner to the right and go over<br/>
to the window you will see carving kits on the wall and on the shelf<br/>
opposite the window you will see the rubber you need to carve with.right<br/>
under the shelf where the rubber is will be the Lily Pad Letterbox.The<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I visited The Lily Pad in Willimantic, CT, yesterday, following clues from letterboxing.org.  I <br/>
needed a bit of help to find the box--the clues were based on where items used to be <br/>
displayed in the store, and apparently it's been completely rearranged!  It's a very nice store &amp; <br/>
a nice stamp, but the placer might want to update the clues a bit.  I tried to email directly <br/>
from the website, but after it got bounced back to me, I realized that the clues also said that <br/>
letterbox questions should be posted here.<br/>
