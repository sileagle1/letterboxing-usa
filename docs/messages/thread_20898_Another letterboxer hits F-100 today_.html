I'm actually at F-101 today.  My first find was April 16th of this year,<br/>
and most have been found in Indiana - a state that currently lists about<br/>
150 boxes.  My farthest find was "Don't Mess with Texas" in July, but I<br/>
also have some from Ohio.  Big thanks to the faraway finders of My Dora<br/>
series, Connecticut?  Since the hobby is just growing fast here now, I<br/>
have had the privilege of many First Finders.<br/>
