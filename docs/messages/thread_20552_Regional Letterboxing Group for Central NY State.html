a new regional Yahoo! subgroup that you're invited to join. It's <br/>
located at:<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbCNY/<br/>
<br/>
This area seems to have just recently sprung to life in the <br/>
letterboxing world, and this group should help to build a <br/>
letterboxing community for that area.<br/>
<br/>
Please join!<br/>

(Yes, San Francisco -- I planted the first box in Oneida County, and <br/>
suddenly started receiving e-mails from people in that area, thanking <br/>
me. I co-moderate this group with my neice, who lives in Oriskany, <br/>
NY, now home of several letterboxes)<br/>
