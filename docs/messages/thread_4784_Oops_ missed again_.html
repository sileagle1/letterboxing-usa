in CT, and I must say that I've had this nagging suspicion that I <br/>
missed a half-week's worth of letterboxes by accidently over-writing <br/>
a file earlier this month. Looking back at the posts in mid-March, I <br/>
see that I missed a bunch of Perfect Circle boxes too. There must be <br/>
others! They call me a "webmaster," but I'm not very proficient with <br/>
html and I'm especially not very detail-oriented, which is a key <br/>
attribute for this business.<br/>
<br/>
I try and do updates twice a week. I'm an unorganized Virgo, so I'm <br/>
not real consistent, but to help with your planning, my schedule <br/>
works best when I do What's New on Tuesday and Saturday-or-Sunday. I <br/>
try and also make the "courtesy" clue pages at the same time for the <br/>
states I cover (CT MA RI CA NV UT NM AZ TX). So if you don't see your <br/>
boxes up within a week, please let me know. I tried for awhile to <br/>
post people individual notes that "your box is up," but my computer <br/>
is so slow and rickety that I gave up on that.<br/>

Sorry for any delay and I'll patch things right up!<br/>
