bema, where are the kid-friendly boxes you've planted? <br/>

we're in michigan, and there are quite a few boxes around, but while <br/>

Hi Jen!  BeMa boxes are in Northern VA.  We always look for boxes that are a <br/>
mile or less (hopefully a circuit [ooooh  The Shaggy nightmare is coming on <br/>
again!...])  A playground nearby makes for excellent bribery material and a <br/>
Baskin Robbins (or Milwaukee Frozen Custard -- we're easy) within easy <br/>
driving distance (ok -- so that part is for me -- but, you know, a Mom is <br/>
the soul of her family, or is that the stomach or the garbage disposal?!  <br/>
One of those things...<br/>
<br/>
Send out an email to the boxers in Michigan asking for their advice on <br/>
family friendly boxes.  I'll bet you'll get some great advice!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun in Michigan!  Maybe we can visit there one day soon.  Da keeps <br/>
telling me tales of his days in Bus. school there and this fantastic <br/>
restaurant run by the family of friends of his (back to food -- how DOES <br/>
that happen?)  BeMa<br/>
