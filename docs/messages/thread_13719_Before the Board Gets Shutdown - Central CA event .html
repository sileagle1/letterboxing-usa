San Luis Obispo, CA. We are planning a potluck, some special stamps, <br/>

in the letterbox-rich area around the central coast of California. We <br/>
should be over 100 boxes in a 50 mi diameter soon.<br/>
<br/>
No, Ryan Carpenter cannot attend any event in Oct or Sept in this <br/>
area. He may stop in November. The rains should not hit us in early <br/>
October. Later, we get our yearly dose in a few months. <br/>
<br/>
Those needing to find out about lodging or campgrounds, please feel <br/>
free to contact me. <br/>
<br/>
This is a preliminary notice. More details will be posted to <br/>
letterboxing.org as long as that site stays up and active.<br/>
