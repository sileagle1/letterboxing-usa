Spokane's first letterbox!!!  And our first experience at placing at<br/>
letterbox!!  Feedback welcome ( I think I was a little verbose with the<br/>
directions ).<br/>
<br/>
Spokane's Finch Arboretum (accessible from Sunset Highway) occupies around<br/>
65 acres of beautiful tree-covered land along Garden Springs Creek in the<br/>
southwest part of Spokane.<br/>
<br/>
The John A. Finch Arboretum was established in 1907 by the Spokane Board of<br/>
Park Commissioners.  The park surrounds a mile-long stretch of Garden<br/>
Springs Creek.  This land came primarily from John. A. Finch, a pioneer<br/>
mining investor and D. H. Wright whose summer cottage, "Brookside" was a<br/>
delightful retreat from the hectic life of a growing city.<br/>
<br/>
Planting began in the Arboretum in 1949 with 49 specimens comprising 10<br/>
genera and 23 species.  Currently, the Arboretum houses over 2,000 labeled<br/>
trees and shrubs, representing over 600 species.<br/>
<br/>
Park at the main parking area (at the extreme eastern end of the Arboretum).<br/>
At the West end of the parking area is a sign/information display.  Standing<br/>
on the West side of the display, head 290 degrees (true) to a small bridge<br/>
over Garden Springs Creek.  Once over the bridge, bear left and climb the<br/>
small rise.  From the top of the rise, head 250 degrees (true) and you will<br/>
cross the South branch of a small dirt service road.  Keep going - you want<br/>
the North branch of the service road.  When you find it - turn left and stay<br/>
on the service road, passing Ginkos on the left, and Pines on the right.<br/>
Press onward along the service road, through Spruce, past Juniper and<br/>
Cotoneaster.  Watch for restrooms on the right.  The service road turns left<br/>
(South), passes Flowering Crabapples, and eventually crosses Garden Springs<br/>
Creek.  Turn right (230 degrees (true)) just before the creek and walk<br/>
upstream parallel to the creek.  Step over a small culvert, onto a trail,<br/>
pass some benches, and enter Corey Glen. At 22 or 11 paces the trail forks -<br/>
bear right.  You're very close now.  Stop on the bridge and admire the<br/>
creek.  We were concerned that rising water might dislodge the box.  Watch<br/>
out for trolls!<br/>
