<br/>
today I visited the Bok Tower letterboxes with my Dad, I was the <br/>
first to stamp in.  This is a wonderful place and I highly recommend <br/>
that you guys come down here to check out these stamps.  (Lovely work <br/>
from Sandi and Doug)  I also got the Sebastian stamp (I was second to <br/>
stamp in there!)  Keep up the good work in Florida, and I hope to <br/>
place a box before I leave on Sunday.<br/>

&gt;  Level:  Medium difficulty, but worth your time!  We suggest you <br/>
use the <br/>
&gt; GuideMap given to you at the entrance.   <br/>
&gt;  Admission: Very nominal fees for adults and children.  Picnic <br/>
areas <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; BOK TOWER GARDENS is a national historic landmark located at the <br/>
summit of <br/>
&gt; Iron Mountain in central Florida.  With its serene gardens, vast <br/>
wildlife, <br/>
&gt; gentle solitude and beauty, it is said to be: “a glorious <br/>
tapestry of <br/>
&gt; nature.”   There are numerous paths to explore and one could <br/>
spend several <br/>
&gt; hours ambling and not see it all!  BOK’s centerpiece, the <br/>
Carillon Tower, <br/>
&gt; reigns over the highest point in Florida.  Here the views of the <br/>
countryside <br/>
&gt; are phenomenal!  The carillon strikes each 1/2 hr. followed by a <br/>
chorus of <br/>
&gt; the bells.  At 3:00 on most days, you can hear a LIVE recital by <br/>
the resident <br/>
&gt; carillonneur.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Garden’s website is linked above.  It will provide you with a <br/>
map for <br/>
&gt; directions to the property, along with a tremendous amount of other <br/>
&gt; information.  Check it out!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please enter the grounds on foot through the new Education and <br/>
Visitor Center <br/>
&gt; Complex.  You may wish to visit the Orientation Theater, Exhibit <br/>
Hall, or the <br/>
&gt; Carillon Cafe.  Both the Gift Shop and the Plant Shop are <br/>
wonderful, and may <br/>
&gt; be best left for the end.   Ready to start now??<br/>
&gt; __________________________________________________________________<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BOK Letterbox #1:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First, seek out the small statue of St. Francis feeding the birds.  <br/>
Which way <br/>
&gt; does his face point?  Follow in the direction of his nose as he is <br/>
telling <br/>
&gt; you which pathway to take next.  When strolling this pathway, you <br/>
will be <br/>
&gt; passing by a bench dedicated to "Judge Warlow," and you will arrive <br/>
at a <br/>
&gt; ‘T.’ Both routes are very scenic, but if it’s the letterbox <br/>
you’re after, <br/>
&gt; choosing the path to the right will be wrong for now. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Take three dozen paces down the mulched path and you will find a <br/>
secluded <br/>
&gt; seating area on your left.  Enter that area and rest on the black <br/>
wrought <br/>
&gt; iron park bench.  In the 12 o'clock position you will see a medium-<br/>
sized <br/>
&gt; magnolia tree.  Past it, at 11 o'clock position, grows a giant live <br/>
oak tree, <br/>
&gt; surrounded by a palm tree and other greenery.  Discretely, check <br/>
out the base <br/>
&gt; of the palm tree.  Did you find what you were seeking?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You may wish to go back to the bench to stamp logs, write us a <br/>
note, etc.  Ple<br/>
&gt; ase replace the box as you found it while passersby are not <br/>
looking! This can <br/>
&gt; be a very popular, busy place from January-April, especially.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you wish to continue looking for letterbox #2 at this time, we <br/>
suggest you <br/>
&gt; return on the same footpaths just taken until you find the bench <br/>
dedicated to <br/>
&gt; ‘Mrs. T. P. Wallow, Sr.’ Sit on the bench.  After resting a <br/>
bit, follow the <br/>
&gt; short path directly ahead leading to a gate. Pausing at that gate, <br/>
you will <br/>
&gt; find a very special view of Historic Pinewood Estate. (Notes about <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; secluded property are found in your Guide Map.)  While there are <br/>
other routes <br/>
&gt; to take to seek box #2, we thought you should not go home without <br/>
at least <br/>
&gt; peeking at this lovely, Mediterranean-revival showcase.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BOK Letterbox #2:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Find Exedra and the Sunset Overlook.  This area is the highest <br/>
point in <br/>
&gt; Florida!!  Isn’t it beautiful?  When you’re ready to leave this <br/>
breathtaking <br/>
&gt; view, take one of the mulched paths due south.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Look for a short westardly path off this main path. It leads you to <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; monument with dove carvings which is a tribute to Edward Bok.  <br/>
After taking a <br/>
&gt; moment to enjoy this monument, walk to the left side of it and go <br/>
BEHIND it.  <br/>
&gt; (A route taken only by a few people!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Proceed walking west through a small parking area.  Ahead of you <br/>
lies an <br/>
&gt; older building (former Education Center). Walk to the left side of <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; building, past the short, black chainlink fencing, and down the old <br/>
steps.  <br/>
&gt; (Anyone looking??)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At the landing of these steps you will find yet another <br/>
overwhelming view.  <br/>
&gt; Look at all the space!  Notice all the live oak trees with dead <br/>
cypress <br/>
&gt; hanging down?  The live oak with a "snag'" is the one to go to.  <br/>
(Refer to <br/>
&gt; 'The Knoll' in your GuideMap to see a picture of a snag!)  At it's <br/>
base is a <br/>
&gt; long log of one of the old trees.  Which end holds Letterbox #2??  <br/>
(Be <br/>
&gt; careful; it's shoved in quite aways.  Need a stick?  Any animals <br/>
living in <br/>
&gt; there?)  Enjoy stamping and returning it safely.  Thanks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have you heard the Singing Tower yet?  You may get to the back side <br/>
of the <br/>
&gt; tower by taking a much less populated route: simply proceed south <br/>
from <br/>
&gt; letterbox #2 site, along the vast lawned area and climb up the <br/>
short hill to <br/>
&gt; the tower’s oak grove.  You have now arrived at one of the <br/>
Garden’s quiet <br/>
&gt; listening areas.  Relax and enjoy!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As you leave the Tower area to complete your explorations, don’t <br/>
forget to <br/>
&gt; view the various angles of the Reflection Pool (Circle 2 on the <br/>
GuideMap.)  <br/>
&gt; Have you seen the family of swans in residence there?  Most people <br/>
don’t know <br/>
&gt; they exist.  Shh-h-h.  It’s special!! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If your time (and energy level) allows, you should see circled <br/>
areas 11 and <br/>
&gt; 12.  The Preserve Trail is a 1/2 hr. walk through a longleaf pine <br/>
forest with <br/>
&gt; shaded benches and signs posted to guide you on your observations <br/>
of the <br/>
&gt; natural Central Florida Ridge ecosystem.  Did you take time to go <br/>
to The <br/>
&gt; Knoll?  (Circle 13).  You won't be sorry.  This trail terminates at <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; parking area.    <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We hope you have had an enjoyable day.  Comments are always <br/>
welcomed in the <br/>
&gt; log books or at our websites above.<br/>
