                    <div class="plaintext-content">those other answers were rather funny but to really answer your question, when you find a Hitchhiker in a box you stamp in just like you would a regular box, the difference being that you then take that stamp and journal with you andd leave it in another box of your choice with the added job of stamping that boxes stamp into the HH journal to track it's travels. We're from MA and have had them end up in CA. they are fun to get and send/track. How's that?<br/>
