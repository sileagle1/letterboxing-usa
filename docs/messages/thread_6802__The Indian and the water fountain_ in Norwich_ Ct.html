As of tomorrow, Amy and I will adopt this series (The Indian and the <br/>
water fountain).  We have made several posts for the person/owner <br/>
that these boxes need up keep, up to and including the point of box <br/>
#2 is missing and has been for several months.  We will pull the <br/>
boxes tomorrow 8/10/2 for up keep and replace what is needed.  We <br/>
will repost when they are replaced.  We will also amend the <br/>
directions as needed, due to the fact that Mohegan Park is under some <br/>
renovations.  Thanks much<br/>

I don't think that the owner of a box would mind if a baggie is <br/>
replaced.  Who ever placed the box wanted it protected and the baggie <br/>
is part of that protection.  We would hate to send some one out to a <br/>
box to replace a baggie if we have extra right there.  The stamp, ink <br/>
pad, and log book should NEVER BE REPLACED WITH OUT STRICT <br/>

Hi Amanda,<br/>
   Good question.  Here's an example for you.  At Amy's and Mine <br/>
(sorry about the grammor, and spelling) 100th box we launched a <br/>
hitchhiker call Centi-bration.  The ink was gold, on purpose, as a <br/>
way of saying "Hey we made it!" The owner of a specific letterbox may <br/>
have had a reason for the color left with the stamp.  Another example <br/>
for ya would be, I know of a stamp that's an ambulance with the color <br/>
blue, again a specific color for a stamp.  So I wouldn't want to <br/>
change the feel of the letterbox by changing the ink pad without <br/>
permission.<br/>
<br/>
Again that's just our take on it. Have fun<br/>
Patrick and Amy<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I can totally understand about the stamp and logbook, but why the <br/>
ink pad?<br/>
&gt; Just curious :)<br/>

Not as of this writing sorry.  With my work schedual, Amy's work <br/>
schedual, and my school schedual it's tough to put two moments <br/>
together.  We were aiming at getting the stuff needed tobe replaced <br/>
on friday night(tomorrow) and replacing the boxes saturday after I <br/>
got out of school.  The other problem is the park is being updated so <br/>
at least one of the boxes is going to have tobe moved slightly, and <br/>
we're going to have to submit new clues for that box.<br/>
If we don't get it out in time for you, again sorry, there is another <br/>
box in the park that we planted that's still there that's eazy. Or if <br/>
you want Leader-of-the-Pack has planted quite a few in the Mansfield <br/>
area that are eazy, and all the stamps are execlent.<br/>
The apperently to slow,<br/>
Patrick and Amy<br/>

&gt; Have these been replaced yet?  We have company visiting and they <br/>
would like to try out Letterboxing so I thought these would be a good <br/>
series for them to start out with.  <br/>

<div><br/></div><tt><br/>Not as of this writing sorry.  With my work 
  schedual, Amy's work <br/>schedual, and my school schedual it's tough to put 
  two moments <br/>together.  We were aiming at getting the stuff needed 
  tobe replaced <br/>on friday night(tomorrow) and replacing the boxes saturday 
  after I <br/>got out of school.  The other problem is the park is being 
  updated so <br/>at least one of the boxes is going to have tobe moved slightly, 
  and <br/>we're going to have to submit new clues for that box.<br/>If we don't 
  get it out in time for you, again sorry, there is another <br/>box in the park 
  that we planted that's still there that's eazy. Or if <br/>you want 
  Leader-of-the-Pack has planted quite a few in the Mansfield <br/>area that are 
  eazy, and all the stamps are execlent.<br/>The apperently to slow,<br/>Patrick
