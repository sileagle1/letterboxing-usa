I know of a Geocacher / Letterboxer  that went into a West Va. forest<br/>
with her grand daughter .<br/>
She got disoriented,it turned dark, and she was afraid to move.  <br/>
And they just slept where they stopped. They sent a rescue team in the<br/>
next morning.<br/>
Luckily everything turned out Okay.<br/>

Was it really the fact that someone went letterboxing alone that got<br/>
someone into trouble, or a poorly made decision somewhere along the<br/>
way that did it? I once remember hearing about a group of three girls<br/>
who got themselves lost in the Columbia River Gorge and spent a pretty<br/>
miserable night out there in the cold, but having more people didn't<br/>
help matters--it just got more people in danger. Had one of them made<br/>
even a half-hearted effort to remember exactly how they got there (or<br/>
even had a map and kept track of where they were at all times), it<br/>
should have never have happened in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail by myself, and I doubt there's<br/>
anything anyone can say that'll stop me from letterboxing alone. Using<br/>
good judgement and not going beyond your abilities is going to save<br/>
far more people than simply telling someone never to letterbox alone.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I'll admit, I don't really know the details about this<br/>
particular incident, but if there's one thing I do know: Poor<br/>
decisions lead to far more 911 calls than hiking simply hiking alone does.<br/>
<br/>
A blanket "never letterbox alone" doesn't really seem like the right<br/>
lesson to learn from such a situation. But that's just my two cents. =)<br/>

I hope she gets out and goes again soon so she can put<br/>
