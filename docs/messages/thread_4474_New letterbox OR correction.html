McIver State Park near the town of Estacada, Clackamas County, Oregon.  <br/>
McIver Park was the site of the region's largest hippie rock Festival, <br/>
Bullfrog, back during the Summer of Love. Jousting Knights and their <br/>
ladies fair can be spotted on the sweeping lawns of this 952 acre park, <br/>
when the Society for Creative Anachronism stages one of their events <br/>
here. This park is not far from Portland and makes for an easy day trip <br/>
and an enjoyable hike along the Clackamas River, past a Chinook salmon <br/>
hatchery and through the surrounding forests. Allow an hour for <br/>
letterboxing while you're here.<br/>
<br/>
to the trailhead: from Portland, go south on I-205 to the Estacada exit <br/>
#12b. Head east and stay on highway 212 to the small town of Carver. <br/>
Don't blink. The road forks in Carver where you will go right across <br/>
the Clackamas River and follow the signs about ten miles to the park. <br/>
Inside the park (day use fee $3) head for the parking lot for picnic <br/>
area F. Walk back along the entry road past the boat ramp to the <br/>
trailhead marked by three posts.<br/>
<br/>
to the letterbox: This is an equestrian trail so count on mud if it's <br/>
been raining. Stay on the main equestrian trail along the river, up the <br/>
bluff and into the forest. Ignore the numerous smaller trails that veer <br/>
off. When you come to a major four way intersection, take the trail at <br/>
110 degrees magnetic. The next intersection will be a three way and you <br/>
take the path at 270 degrees. If you need a rest, your rustic room is <br/>
just ahead. After you've taken a dozen steps between bands of white, <br/>
continue on the path downhill. At he bottom of the hill the trail will <br/>
meet up with a dirt road. Turn towards the cedars and proceed past <br/>
steely objects white and green. After you have crossed two bridges, <br/>
keep your eyes to the right. Find the nurse with a youngster sprouting <br/>
from her top. The letterbox lives behind the nurse sheltered by a mossy <br/>
door. After you stamp in, continue on the same trail.Turn right at the <br/>
T and you will soon be back at your car.<br/>
