St.Louis area over the weekend and were soooo disappointed.  The first is the one <br/>
in Kirkwood Park, which we couldn't find at all.  Couldn't find a pile of <br/>
small logs to look under even.  We fear the logs and the box have been washed <br/>
away.  Is the placer of that box on this list?   We were going to go back and see <br/>
if we just looked in the wrong place, but not until I hear from the placer.<br/>
<br/>
We also tried to find the one in Frontier Park on the St. Charles riverfront. <br/>
 "Happy Camper" is its name.  We actually think we found where it was hidden, <br/>
but it's not there.  <br/>
<br/>
I tried to notify the placers of both of these boxes from the Letterboxing <br/>
website, but now wonder if those messages were sent.  <br/>
