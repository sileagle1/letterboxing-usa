<br/>
I've been making my own log books, and am now making some for the <br/>
grand children.  I recently received a log book (another story, will <br/>
pass it along when I have more time) and it's hand made, too, and it <br/>
has some nice gold colored metal decorative corner protectors on each <br/>
corner.  I was wondering if any one on this forum might know where I <br/>
can get some? Either at a retail store, or on-line?  I've checked out <br/>
WallyWorld, and Hobby Lobby in this area, and they don't have them.<br/>
<br/>
Help???<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,,,<br/>
<br/>

An online emporium, two peas in a bucket might have them. <br/>
