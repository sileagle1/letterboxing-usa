Hi boxers:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There's a contest presently underway to design our own LbNE logo for <br/>
the Northeast letterboxing community. You are invited to check out the<br/>
details at our website. While I realize that this is a national list, <br/>
I also know that there is some great national talent out there as <br/>
well and want to offer the design aspect to all letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, this new logo will be use in a full line of clothing, <br/>
backpacks, etc. While we are not involved in the sale or profit of <br/>
these items, we've offered our website as a medium to facilitate <br/>
these sales as a favor to a local CT boxer.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! [And design a logo!]<br/>
<br/>

Cool! The one I always liked best was on the letterbox-southeast <br/>
group, but it seems to have been replaced. It looked alot like the <br/>
LbNA logo DerMadStamper designed, but with the letters changed to <br/>
LbSE and the little compass arrow pointing, well, southeastwards. <br/>
Very creative and very nicely done. It was at:<br/>

Good luck with the contest!<br/>

I've reviewed the rules for the logo design contest but had a question <br/>
that I'm sure others would be interested in knowing.  Is there a maximum <br/>
or minimum size for the logo?  Reason being, the patch might be too <br/>
small for some of the detail that some of us might try.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good question Jim. I would think the final size for manufacturing would<br/>
be somewhere in the range of 3 x 3 or thereabouts.<br/>
<br/>
But, the image should be provided say twice that size. It's easier to<br/>
reduce a larger image and still maintain the quality than to have to<br/>
enlarge it.<br/>
<br/>
The winning entry designer may have to resubmit in the needed size but<br/>
with technology today, I think we'll be fine.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks! That's really nice of you to say. It was challenging trying <br/>
to come up with something distinctive enough to say "our group" while <br/>
keeping the general lbx community spirit. I'm tickled that you picked <br/>
up on the compass direction.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the LbSe logo is not permanently removed, it goes away when <br/>
there's an event being advertised. It comes back as the masthead for <br/>
our regional list when the events are over. Those who are LbSe list <br/>
members can still see it in the photos section.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx, Jay!<br/>
