friend. I place this letterbox on her island where she was born, raised and 
lived. She worked faithfully at Roosevelt Park in the "Prince Cottage" for many 
years. Make sure you stop by for a visit. It is free of charge and she would 
have loved to show you around "her park". 
<p align="left">Aunt Belle and I made this walk many times. I am sure you can 
still hear us giggling and chatting if you listen close enough.</p>

<p align="center">Clues: </p>
<p align="left">Cross the bridge from Lubec, Maine to Campobello, Island, New 
Brunswick, Canada. Stop at the border crossing (note: this is not a toll booth, 
many people think it is! You are entering Canada - the border officials are 
really nice - just tell them you are visiting Roosevelt Park for the day - dont 
forget identification i.e. drivers license, birth certificate etc.)</p>
<p align="left">After you pass through the border proceed to Herring Cove by going 
straight. You will pass Roosevelt Park (on your left -you may want to visit here 
before or after your walk - its free!) Proceed 1.5 km past the Roosevelt Park 
entrance. You will come to an intersection, turn right. The next road you see 
with be the Herring Cove Road. Take this right. Proceed to the end of this road 
(pass the Herring Cove Golf Course &amp; Herring Cove campground). Park at 
Herring Cove beach. While facing the sea, there is a path that leads to your 
left. Walk up this trail and you will soon see another trail leading to your 
right which is the Herring Cove Overlook. Look under the set of steps leading to 
the overlook. There awaits your prize!!</p>
