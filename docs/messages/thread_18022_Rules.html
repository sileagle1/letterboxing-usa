<br/>
Are There any Rules?<br/>
The old cliche is that the only rule is that there are no rules. That <br/>
is true for the art of letterboxing in many senses, although there is <br/>
some common sense etiquette:<br/>
Respect the land when hunting boxes and when hiding them. Don't place <br/>
a box that requires people to tramp through sensitive wildlife or <br/>
plant habitat to find it, for example. Warn hunters of possible <br/>
hazards in the area of the box in your clue notes. Use common sense. <br/>
If you have any doubts, ask the land owner or manager, or simply <br/>
choose another location for your activities. Adopt the Leave No Trace <br/>
principles of outdoor etiquette. Remember, some lands have <br/>
restrictions on land use; know them and observe them. <br/>
<br/>
Don't publish or re-transmit other peoples' clues or stamp images <br/>
without their permission. <br/>
<br/>
Repack and hide the thing as well or better than it was when you <br/>
found it, in the exact place you found it. After finding it, try to <br/>
be discreet when stamping up and re-hiding it, as if you were hiding <br/>
your own box for the first time. When I find one, I usually carry it <br/>
deeper into the woods to stamp up, so as to not give away its <br/>
location to any passerby's, then put it back when I am done. <br/>
<br/>
Do not post clue solutions on the Internet or discuss how to solve <br/>
clues in public fora. That spoils the fun for everyone else. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, do not violate the laws, rules, customs, and people's or <br/>
property rights wherever you conduct any activities. <br/>

Hey Geogeorgia,<br/>
<br/>
Try this link to Atlas Quest,  http://atlasquest.com/aboutlb/  <br/>
another site containing clues and other info.  Check out the FAQ <br/>
page and the glossary page, alot of the terms we use may sound <br/>
criptic themselves.  Another great way to learn about planting is to <br/>
go out and find 'different' peoples boxes to get an idea how others <br/>
do it, then add your own little twist.  I suggest finding 5-10 boxes <br/>
before planting to all new boxers.  Unfortunately I didn't have that <br/>
opption back when I started and my first few suffered.  Which box <br/>
did you find by accident?  (A few of us would like to know)<br/>
<br/>
The baggie rule isn't a rule but is being disscused more as a <br/>
proceedure.  Most boxes leak water so putting your log in a good <br/>
ziplock is a must but then we noticed double bagging them helps <br/>
elminate user error.  Putting the stamp in a bag is nice, so that <br/>
the ink from it doesn't get all over everything.  Once all of that <br/>
is in it's tupperware then some people stick their box in a larger <br/>
Ziplock. I personally don't use outer bags anymore because once it <br/>
gets a little hole in it it's useless.  To each his own right.<br/>
<br/>
Boxdn,<br/>

It occurred to me that this topic, should it continue, ought to move to regional lists as <br/>
climates vary widely and change with the seasons.  It seems like it has been beaten to <br/>
death here.<br/>

Dear Investigator Bacon<br/>
<br/>
 Your approach is totally wrong as well as YOUR manners. Coming from <br/>
someone that knows, being obnoxious will get you nothing. Bringing a <br/>
fellow investigator into this goes against all ethical standards. Now <br/>
HAD I absconded with a Store of Good Manners then you would have no <br/>
clue. Your ineptness is quite apparent, and I wonder if you could <br/>
track an elephant in the snow.<br/>
<br/>
 Years of sneakiness and stealth ness acquired by being a Private <br/>
Investigator and the stealth practices used in letterboxing have <br/>
honed my skills way past your abilities.<br/>
<br/>
 Most hardcore letterboxers know the value of being stealthy, whether <br/>
it is their number 1 letterbox or their 67th. Only a dufus walks <br/>
right up to a planted box without being stealthy as it puts that box <br/>
at risk.<br/>
The word "stealth" is derived from the word steal, and while most of <br/>
us understand the common definition of `steal', there is one that is <br/>
seldom used; "to move silently or secretly". While I have used the <br/>
term stealth on many occasions on this and other chatlists, I would <br/>
not steal (common definition) anyones' Store of Good Manners.<br/>
 Good Manners are too hard to come by, and too easily dismissed.<br/>
<br/>
I will not confess to something that I did not do. I did not steal <br/>
the Store of Good Manners.<br/>
 Evidence of my innocence can be found by my being able to contain my <br/>
manners on the Newboxer chatlist.<br/>
<br/>
Now regarding my being full of sh*t, that is a comment that is <br/>
familiar and all too often mentioned, and while it may be true in <br/>
some cases, in the "Great Groover Caper" that entire story is true. <br/>
The length of the story precludes it from presentation in this note <br/>
plus the story is best told in person. Suffice to say that the Thief <br/>
and the Cops both thought the ending was pretty crappy, and anyone <br/>
that wishes a first hand rendition just has to ask. The thief's <br/>
future is surely questionable to say the least, since stealing a full <br/>
Groover (aka  porta potty) from the back end of a pickup truck <br/>
certainly would not qualify him for Mensa.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise the story of Silent Doug's Key was indeed fact. The key <br/>
wasn't missing, SD left it in the rental car, engine running, and <br/>
locked the door of the car sitting in our driveway all in his <br/>
excitement of finally meeting someone that has put up with me for so <br/>
many years  Gwen.<br/>
<br/>
Sure I tend to exaggerate a bit, but never steal.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't steal the EWE. I was helping the Basque herdsmen trying to <br/>
locate that little ewe.<br/>
It just took me a while to understand that they weren't trying to <br/>
chase me off when they kept saying "You be gone!"<br/>
<br/>
Now we are ready to embark on our summer time letterboxing/clay-<br/>
shooting jaunt, so please realize that you are way off base in <br/>
bringing me/us into this investigation. Your time can be better spent <br/>
by sticking to any clue that points toward someone that would benefit <br/>
from having an absence of Good Manners.<br/>
<br/>
While we are gone I have asked my Nephew Wassamatta_u to come to our <br/>
defense.<br/>
Now I'm sure "That" news is a mind blower for many, maybe even for <br/>
Wassamatta_u, but we have a relative that was a home delivery <br/>
milkman, but that is another story, for another time. This was <br/>
discovered recently by one of my genealogy searches.<br/>
 Hopefully further accusations won't be forth coming, but if they are <br/>
then they will be dispensed with quite effectively no matter how <br/>
twisted and inaccurate they may be.<br/>
Wassamatta_u is very erudite and even makes old news interesting in <br/>
his blogs on AQ.<br/>
<br/>
All bills forwarded in this direction will be properly ignored <br/>
particularly from some fancy New York restaurant.<br/>

<br/>
You accuse Don of stealing the Store of Good Manners, and use as evidence<br/>
his failure at stealth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can only surmise that you are familiar with the good works of the man for<br/>
whom you are ostensibly named.  No, I do NOT mean Francis Thomas Bacon, the<br/>
English engineer who developed the first practical<br/>
<http: en.wikipedia.org="" oxygen="" wiki=""> hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell.  Nor do I<br/>
mean Francis Bacon the painter, whose art was so well known for its bold,<br/>
austere, and often grotesque imagery.  Rather, I mean Sir Francis Bacon, the<br/>
English philosopher, essayist, and scientist.  As you must undoubtedly know,<br/>
Bacon pioneered "The Scientific Method" in which the CAUSE of a phenomenon<br/>
can be isolated by gathering observable, empirical, measurable evidence, and<br/>
subjecting them to specific principles of reasoning.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I submit to you, sir (though not Sir), that you are completely failing to<br/>
adhere to the tenets of The Scientific Method in your dealings with my Uncle<br/>
Don.  More about that in a bit, but first.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
UNCLE DON?!?!?!!!??!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(deep, calming breath. must. maintain. composure.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Growing up in the backwoods of Kernville (how's THAT for redundant?), Uncle<br/>
Don and I spent many an hour on the back porch of the cabin shooting the<br/>
breeze (and anything else that moved).  But the thing is, even though I<br/>
CALLED him "Uncle Don", I never actually figured we were related.  I mean,<br/>
let's face it, mom introduced me to a different "Uncle" pretty much every<br/>
week, so I never really gave it much thought.  When I was in Grade 2 (along<br/>
with the rest of the Kernville teens), that year alone I had 66 "Uncles"!<br/>
So the fact that Don really IS my uncle, well, that ALONE shows you just how<br/>
stealthy he is!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, genealogical surprises aside, let us take a closer look at your<br/>
accusation of my dear, dear blood-relative, Uncle Don.  The first step in<br/>
The Scientific Method requires us to "gather observable evidence."  I ask<br/>
you, have you ever actually OBSERVED Uncle Don being stealthy?  NO!  Of<br/>
course not!  In order to observe him being stealthy, he would have to be<br/>
unstealthy, in which case you would be observing unstealthiness instead of<br/>
his natural stealthitudity (hold on a minute here while I disable my<br/>
spell-checker).  So, we can conclude Scientifically that because you have<br/>
NOT observed him being stealthy, he must therefore BE stealthy!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The second point in the Scientific Method involves Gathering Empirical data.<br/>
I ask you, have you EVER met anyone MORE Imperious than Uncle Don at a<br/>
Gathering?  I think not.  (And Uncle Don, if you're reading this, I mean<br/>
that in the most loving and respectful way possible...)  According to The<br/>
Random House Unabridged Dictionary, "stealth" means "Secret, Clandestine".<br/>
Now, a "Gathering" is neither Secret, nor Clandestine - if it was, it would<br/>
be a "Soloing".  And since Uncle Don is, as referenced earlier, the most<br/>
imperious person at a Gathering (in this case, "Imperious" meaning "Regal"),<br/>
he is therefore the King of the Gathering.  Uncle Don King, so to speak.<br/>
And as we were taught in the Arthurian legend "L'morte de Arthur", the King<br/>
IS the Country.  In this case, then, Uncle Don IS the Gathering.  Therefore,<br/>
by applying the Transitive property (that's MATH, not cross-dressing): If<br/>
Uncle Don=Gathering, and Gathering=Non-Stealth, then logically we get Uncle<br/>
Don=. wait a sec. uh, ummm, never mind.  Oh look!  A shiny object!  No,<br/>
wait. that's just Uncle Don's head.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And finally (as if this hasn't gone on long enough), we come to the<br/>
Scientific Requirement for "Measurable Evidence."   I remember once when I<br/>
was a kid, Uncle Don and I were going to go out fishing, me with my<br/>
cane-pole and bent safety-pin hook, Uncle Don with his Red Ryder<br/>
Carbine-action Range Model Shotgun with the compass in the stock.  Somebody<br/>
asked Uncle Don "Which way is North?"  Now, MOST people would make use of<br/>
the fact that there was a compass in the stock, and provide the inquirer<br/>
with proper directions.  But not Uncle Don.  Nope.  Uncle Don simply pointed<br/>
the shotgun straight up in the air, and pulled the trigger.  Aunt Gwen was<br/>
not really thrilled by this, seeing as we were in their trailer at the time,<br/>
but the incident DOES go to the point that Uncle Don refused to use an<br/>
instrument of measurement.  In fact, Uncle Don to this day never uses<br/>
measurements of any kind!  Ask him how good he is at Shooting Clays (he<br/>
never WAS an American Idol fan), he will reply "immeasurable."  Ask him how<br/>
good his carvings are, he will reply "immeasurable."  Ask him how much he<br/>
loves and respects Aunt Gwen, and he will reply "immeasurable." (&lt; --<br/>
blatant sucking up here; Christmas is just around the corner, and they owe<br/>
their Nephew several decades worth of back-presents.)  So I ask you,<br/>
Investigator Bacon, how do you propose to gather "Measurable Evidence" from<br/>
a man for whom nothing is measurable!  You CAN'T!  Face it, based on the<br/>
Scientific Principle, you haven't a leg to stand on (especially if you<br/>
happen to ask Uncle Don "Which way is South?").<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And so, Investigator Bacon, I will leave you to form new and (hopefully)<br/>
improved theories, as my response has made the need for this painfully clear<br/>
(or at least, painful to read).  And Uncle Don, if you're reading this. NO<br/>
MORE UNDIES for Christmas!  I got Boxers and Briefs coming out my ears!<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Re: Rules<br/>

<br/>
Dear Investigator Bacon<br/>
<br/>
Your approach is totally wrong as well as YOUR manners. Coming from <br/>
someone that knows, being obnoxious will get you nothing. Bringing a <br/>
fellow investigator into this goes against all ethical standards. Now <br/>
HAD I absconded with a Store of Good Manners then you would have no <br/>
clue. Your ineptness is quite apparent, and I wonder if you could <br/>
track an elephant in the snow.<br/>
<br/>
Years of sneakiness and stealth ness acquired by being a Private <br/>
Investigator and the stealth practices used in letterboxing have <br/>
honed my skills way past your abilities.<br/>
<br/>
Most hardcore letterboxers know the value of being stealthy, whether <br/>
it is their number 1 letterbox or their 67th. Only a dufus walks <br/>
right up to a planted box without being stealthy as it puts that box <br/>
at risk.<br/>
The word "stealth" is derived from the word steal, and while most of <br/>
us understand the common definition of `steal', there is one that is <br/>
seldom used; "to move silently or secretly". While I have used the <br/>
term stealth on many occasions on this and other chatlists, I would <br/>
not steal (common definition) anyones' Store of Good Manners.<br/>
Good Manners are too hard to come by, and too easily dismissed.<br/>
<br/>
I will not confess to something that I did not do. I did not steal <br/>
the Store of Good Manners.<br/>
Evidence of my innocence can be found by my being able to contain my <br/>
manners on the Newboxer chatlist.<br/>
<br/>
Now regarding my being full of sh*t, that is a comment that is <br/>
familiar and all too often mentioned, and while it may be true in <br/>
some cases, in the "Great Groover Caper" that entire story is true. <br/>
The length of the story precludes it from presentation in this note <br/>
plus the story is best told in person. Suffice to say that the Thief <br/>
and the Cops both thought the ending was pretty crappy, and anyone <br/>
that wishes a first hand rendition just has to ask. The thief's <br/>
future is surely questionable to say the least, since stealing a full <br/>
Groover (aka porta potty) from the back end of a pickup truck <br/>
certainly would not qualify him for Mensa.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise the story of Silent Doug's Key was indeed fact. The key <br/>
wasn't missing, SD left it in the rental car, engine running, and <br/>
locked the door of the car sitting in our driveway all in his <br/>
excitement of finally meeting someone that has put up with me for so <br/>
many years .Gwen.<br/>
<br/>
Sure I tend to exaggerate a bit, but never steal.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't steal the EWE. I was helping the Basque herdsmen trying to <br/>
locate that little ewe.<br/>
It just took me a while to understand that they weren't trying to <br/>
chase me off when they kept saying "You be gone!"<br/>
<br/>
Now we are ready to embark on our summer time letterboxing/clay-<br/>
shooting jaunt, so please realize that you are way off base in <br/>
bringing me/us into this investigation. Your time can be better spent <br/>
by sticking to any clue that points toward someone that would benefit <br/>
from having an absence of Good Manners.<br/>
<br/>
While we are gone I have asked my Nephew Wassamatta_u to come to our <br/>
defense.<br/>
Now I'm sure "That" news is a mind blower for many, maybe even for <br/>
Wassamatta_u, but we have a relative that was a home delivery <br/>
milkman, but that is another story, for another time. This was <br/>
discovered recently by one of my genealogy searches.<br/>
Hopefully further accusations won't be forth coming, but if they are <br/>
then they will be dispensed with quite effectively no matter how <br/>
twisted and inaccurate they may be.<br/>
Wassamatta_u is very erudite and even makes old news interesting in <br/>
his blogs on AQ.<br/>
<br/>
All bills forwarded in this direction will be properly ignored <br/>
particularly from some fancy New York restaurant.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Keys and ewes go missing in your presence. What else<br/>
&gt; are you guilty of? A missing Store of Good Manners?<br/>
&gt; Time to step up and confess the error of your ways.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By your own admission, you are glad there are no rules<br/>

&gt; guy who advocates being nice to newbies, you sure go<br/>
&gt; on a lot of letterboxing/shooting jaunts. Just what is<br/>

&gt; &gt; That said, anyone is free to develop a letterboxing web site that<br/>
&gt; &gt; attempts to enforce placement density, if they want to.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; adjective, not name calling, but heck, a rose by any other name ... ;-))<br/>

&gt; Regardless, no one was trying to make up rules.  <br/>
<br/>
We will have to agree to disagree.  Whether the R word<br/>
is used or not, it is what it is.  Letterboxers do not presently<br/>
observe placement density conventions, and it was suggested that<br/>
they do so.  I didn't object because I thought this was a rule,<br/>
but because I thought it was a bad idea, regardless of what it<br/>
is called.<br/>
