Whitecliff  Course<br/>
by Crestwood Parks &amp; Recreation <br/>
<br/>
N 38 33.414 W 090 21.895 <br/>
  In Missouri, United States <br/>
Hidden: 4/8/2002<br/>
<br/>
(ratings out of 5 stars. 1 is easiest, 5 is hardest)<br/>
Difficulty:  Terrain:  <br/>
<br/>
This box course is sponsored and maintained by the Crestwood Parks and <br/>
Recreation Department and is intended to introduce visitors to Whitecliff <br/>
Park. It is open to families with children, and anyone who wants to visit and <br/>
explorer the park.<br/>
<br/>
Use a gps to locate the hidden clues or stop by the park office for a clue <br/>
map ... traditional letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
&gt;                             Community Center hours are:<br/>
&gt; Mon-Thur: 8AM-10PM<br/>
&gt; Friday: 10AM-6PM<br/>
&gt; Saturday: 9AM-12:30PM<br/>
&gt; Sunday: Closed<br/>
&gt; The park hours are still 7AM-11PM 7 days a week. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
Each of the five waypoints/ hidden clues consists of a 6" square brass plaque <br/>
<br/>
&gt; imbedded in concrete and engraved with the coordinates of the next hidden <br/>
&gt; clue coordinates along with a single letter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
  The cache contains special Crestwood Geocache pencils, buttons, <br/>
letterboxing stamp and a logbook. Each cacher may take just one pencil and <br/>
button and leave a log entry. Nothing should be left in the cache box except <br/>
a log entry.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote 3="" <br="" at="" first="" full="" left="" number,="" one="" right="" stopping="" the="" to="" turns="" type="CITE">
&gt; full turn past the first number stopping at the second, and RIGHT to the <br/>
&gt; third number". Continue turning right after the last number until the dial <br/>
&gt; stops and pull open the door, this is tricky. Please close the door <br/>
&gt; securely when finished and turn dial LEFT one full turn. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Enter the letter from each waypoint below and then use the chart to convert <br/>
&gt; the letter to the proper number for the combination. <br/>
<br/>
WP1___WP2___     WP3___WP4___     WP5___ <br/>
&gt; Cache ___<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; |A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|<br/>
&gt; ---------------------<br/>
&gt; |4|5|2|1|1|5|0|3|<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Combination= ____,  ____,  ____<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
i.e. If WP 1-5 and the cache contains A, C, G, F, D, &amp; H <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and equates to 4, 2, 0, 5, 1, &amp; 3.<br/>
&gt; The combination would be 42, 05, 13. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is a first for the St. Louis area and the state of Missouri whereas a <br/>
&gt; city is behind and encourages the Letterboxing, Geocaching craze. The park <br/>
&gt; is open to bushwacking between the waypoints or a leisurely walk along the <br/>
&gt; trails. Since there is construction in progress between WP3 and WP4, we ask <br/>
&gt; that you stay outside the orange fence around the construction area and <br/>
&gt; adhere to the park hours of 7AM to 11PM, 7 days a week.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The lower parking area near WP 1 closes at 1/2 hour after dusk, but the <br/>
&gt; road is open until 11PM for walking. Additional parking is available in the <br/>
&gt; upper level of the park.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; NOTES:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All of the waypoints are within the 100-acre park boundaries. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Total distance is appoximately 1.75 miles, but your mileage may differ. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also available at the Community Center are maps and hints for the waypoints <br/>
&gt; and the actual cache. This will provide a way for those without a GPS to <br/>
&gt; participate in the hunt and reward. The <a href="http://www.ci.crestwood.mo.us/Services/P%26RHomePage/index.htm">Crestwood Parks website</a> also <br/>
&gt; contains links to the maps and hints in Adobe PDF format.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Grant's Trail, a paved 6 mile bike path, is just 1 block from the park <br/>
&gt; entrance. It follows an old RR bed along Gravois creek and goes East to <br/>
&gt; Interstate 55. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3/4 miles in the other direction (Grant Rd &amp; Gravois) is the location of <br/>
&gt; Grant's Farm, an enjoyable place to tour.<br/>
