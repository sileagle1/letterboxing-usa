I went to check on my Port Clinton, OH (Ottawa County) <br/>
letterboxes over the weekend. I haven't been able to drive for a <br/>
few months, so I haven't been up there in a while.<br/>
<br/>
One of the boxes was placed in the cemetery under some really <br/>
overgrown bushes that had not been maintained in years. They <br/>
looked horrible, and were perfect for placing a box under. I <br/>
figured, even if they were trimmed, the box was in a good spot. <br/>
My Mom were shocked to see the bushes were gone! They <br/>
weren't just trimmed back, they were gone! I got a little worried <br/>
until I saw a little plastic box sitting on top of the dirt. Apparently, <br/>
they had ripped out the bushes, evened out the dirt and put my <br/>
letterbox right on top!<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, the box has been moved to a better spot in the <br/>
cemetery and the directions will be updated today. I just can't <br/>
believe they didn't just pitch the box! I wonder what the <br/>
landscapers thought when they found it and whether they read <br/>
what was inside.<br/>

Maybe they thought the box holds somebody's ashes.<br/>
