missing boxes were never answered.  Glad it is a problem with the <br/>
site and not the placers!  Any way there are a few boxes we tried to <br/>
find with no luck and I wanted to let the placers and everybody else <br/>
know they are missing:<br/>
<br/>
Penobscot Expedition, Bangor Maine.  We looked all over the rocks for <br/>
this one and finally had to give up.  We looked under the pier, as <br/>
well as down stream a bit. We searched on 8/31/03.<br/>
<br/>
Best Friends, Topsham, ME.  Again lots of rocks but no box.  We are <br/>
pretty sure we had the right location (TeamGreenDragon, if you are <br/>
reading this, is it up near the concrete wall?).  We looked for this <br/>
box on 9/13/03.<br/>
<br/>
Rings in Heaven, Bruswick, ME.  We found the spot, even though we <br/>
were forwarned that it was missing.  Sure enough, no box.  I had seen <br/>
a post that it was replaced, but either we missed it, or it is <br/>
missing again.  I hope we just missed it!  Searched on 9/13/03<br/>
<br/>
All and all, we have found many boxes and many previously unknown <br/>
parks and hikes that have truely been amazing for all of us.  Thanks <br/>
to all for leading us to these little known gems throughout the state.<br/>

Well, I can't speak for the other boxes, but I believe that the <br/>
caretaker of the Rings in Heaven box confirmed that it was missing and I <br/>
don't believe it has been replaced yet. Are you from Maine or just <br/>
passing through?<br/>

afraid to put it in the same spot without a proper waiting period.<br/>
When I finally do replace it.. I will post to the clue site.  <br/>
As far as Best Friends.. sounds like you probably weren't looking in <br/>
the right place. It took me HOURS and two trips to find that darn <br/>
box.... and it's such a small area! My sister ultimately found it <br/>
for me.. grr! <br/>

Nautilus: we are indeed from Maine, and will check the vheck the Best <br/>
Friends box again once TeamGreenDragon confirms it is their.<br/>
<br/>
TeamGreen Dragon:  Thanks for taking a look.  Hope it was just us and <br/>
that box is still there!<br/>
<br/>
Kstar:  Sorry to have missed the Rings in Heaven box and will wait to <br/>
see when you replace it then try again.<br/>
<br/>
Phyto:  We will be looking for your boxes soon.  The next trip to <br/>
Bangor in a couple of weeks.  Usually we spend a day during the <br/>
weekend just for letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Heading to the Freehold area this weekend to search around the Wolf <br/>
Neck Park area.  Wish us luck!  (with boxes and weather!)<br/>
