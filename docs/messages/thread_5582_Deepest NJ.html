haven't been reading all the newsgroup messages and I know that it was found<br/>
last year.  I finally cracked the riddle and will be going for it next week.<br/>
Also, if nobody's found it, then we can't be sure of it's condition.<br/>
<br/>
Todd - I met you and Pam by Pyramid Rock last year.  Thanks for not giving<br/>
any new hints.  It made the find even sweeter.<br/>
