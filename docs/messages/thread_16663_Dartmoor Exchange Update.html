<br/>
This is what's going on with the Dartmoor exchange:<br/>
<br/>
- I'm in the process of making a page on my website.  I can't make a<br/>
talk list / forum for it though.  Graham's going to send me some<br/>
photo's and more info on different types of clues so we'll have<br/>
somethings visual to look at too.<br/>
- Graham Howard 'The Moorland Wizard' is now a member of the New Age<br/>
Letterboxing list. :-)<br/>
- Sheep eat micro-boxes <yum, lips="" of="" smacking=""> so plan on making them<br/>
regular size or even larger.<br/>
- Since boxes and logbooks are also available in the UK we don't need<br/>
to worry about shipping them back &amp; forth.  We can just purchase for<br/>
the actual box we plant.  But, if anyone wants to handmake a logbook<br/>
don't be discouraged - go right ahead with it.  <br/>
- The actual trade will take place in the spring.<br/>
- The theme is 'Britain in America'.<br/>
- Some boxes being made (that I know of):<br/>
	-John Wesley who founded the Methodist Church <br/>
	-The village of Liverpool and/or Bath <br/>
	-Farming in america<br/>
	-Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts<br/>
- If you want to join up contact me: catbead1 <libby@twcny.rr.com><br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
