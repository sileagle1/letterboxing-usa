I was introduced by a fellow artist and journaler, Aisling, to the <br/>
concept of letterboxing just recently, and google-searching around in <br/>
hopes of a few boxes in California, came across this fantastic site for <br/>
tracking geocaches; a similar concept/game undertaken by folks with GPS <br/>
scanners, but with enough coded hints for those of us without GPS <br/>
receivers to be able to find.  Went and located my first, well hidden in <br/>
San Francisco, this evening!<br/>
<br/>
check out:<br/>
http://www.geocaching.com/<br/>
<br/>
Might be a great place for logging and tracking caches and hitchhikers <br/>
and combining favorite features from both kinds of players - the <br/>
letterbox crowd seems to be doing something more like orienteering and <br/>
rubberstamping; the GPS folks seem to be zooming in on location with <br/>
hints, and having little things to find; swap in and out, and lots of <br/>
travelers, as well as the logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
Fascinating!<br/>
<br/>
best,<br/>
