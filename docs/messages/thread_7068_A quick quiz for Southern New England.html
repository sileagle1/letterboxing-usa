<br/>
Ironic, isn't it, that the letterbox for Paul has turned out to be <br/>
the hardest? Most folks dismissed him as the cute one, without the <br/>
stunning musicality of Lennon or the mysticism of Harrison, and <br/>
lacking the randy bluecollar appeal of Starr. Yet he lives in estate <br/>
on the Scottish coast, a member of the Forbes Richest, successful in <br/>
marriage and in supporting his partner's heroic fight against cancer, <br/>
and was knighted by the Queen. It turns out that there are several <br/>
geo-markers in the area although only one is marked on the trail map, <br/>
which makes finding Sir Paul a challenge. I had changed the clues a <br/>
bit, but a lovely letterboxer a half generation older than I <br/>
convinced me to leave them as-is. Paul, it turns out, was never dead <br/>
despite all the bizarre historical evidence to the contrary. The box <br/>
fits the story...<br/>
