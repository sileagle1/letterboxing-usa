                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We went on our first expedition yesterday (23 degrees outside!)  <br/>
Found out about letterboxing from last weekend's article in the <br/>
Detroit Free Press -- then spent this week carving our stamp and <br/>
reading through the clues for SE Michigan.<br/>
<br/>
The "Bloomfield Heron" at the nature center in Bloomfield Hills was <br/>
in great shape.  But, no luck with the "Secret Garden" in Royal Oak.  <br/>
Does anyone know if that one's gone for the winter, or do we need to <br/>
work a little harder at interpreting the clues?<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to search for all the other boxes in the area and <br/>
throughout the state!<br/>

I wasn't able to find it when I was there in October 2002, so I suspect it <br/>
is lost. There didn't appear to be too many places where it could have been <br/>
successfully hidden for very long.<br/>

Wow, I wish I'd checked here before going to look for it yesterday!  <br/>
I'm a geocacher -- hi, Puppylover! -- and I was going to make Secret <br/>
Garden my first letterbox.  I agree, there aren't a lot of places to <br/>
hide a box there.  Neat location, though.  I'll have to make <br/>
Bloomfield Heron my first, possibly next week.<br/>

<br/>
I know the person that placed the box is a friend of Edugaytor, the same<br/>
boxer that placed the Independence Oaks series. You might want to drop him<br/>
an email and let him know the box is missing as he could probably let the<br/>
box owner know.<br/>
<br/>
The Heron is an awesome box, as is the entire group at Independence Oaks in<br/>
Clarkston. Ruthann also has several nice boxes a little further south. And,<br/>
last but not least...LOL someone has some very lonely boxes out in the<br/>
Ortonville rec area (subtle hint) that could do with a visitor or two.<br/>
<br/>
Have you considered placing a bow or two, or three.... around these parts?<br/>
We sure need the help in boosting our numbers!<br/>
<br/>
Happy caching and boxing from a fellow boxer and cacher,<br/>
