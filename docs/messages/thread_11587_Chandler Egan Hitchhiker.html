                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi we are the Scheck family from Niantic. We have been lettterboxing <br/>
for about 1 year. On our recent adventure in Milo Light (3/29/2003) <br/>
we found the Chandler Egan Hitchhiker. I have to say it is a very <br/>
well made stamp. We took some friends with us on their first <br/>
letterboxing hike. I told them that I had never found a hitchhiker <br/>
in the year that I have been doing this. Imagine their surprise when <br/>
finding one on their first time. Thanks go to Team Green Dragon for <br/>
this Hitchhiker.<br/>
