romp through the Blue Hills. Though we're both from this state, it <br/>
was our first trip to this park and certainly not our last! We were <br/>
amazed at the lack of people on the trails but we're assuming that <br/>
it's only because it is so early in the season. Regardless..it was <br/>
great to have some peace and quiet while enjoying the views of the <br/>
surrounding areas and the Boston skyline.<br/>
<br/>
We based our trip around TeamGreenDragon's Time Travels series and <br/>
picked up:<br/>
-Into the Future<br/>
-Time Traveller's Return<br/>
-Morlock Holes<br/>
-Fiendish Things<br/>
<br/>
...in that order (and all in great condition). This is a great series <br/>
of stamps and it was fun to research the historical data beforehand. <br/>
It looks like we had the wrong date for "Weena" so we'll pick up that <br/>
one and the sixth box on our next trip. Along the way, we also <br/>
nabbed "Blue Hills Birthday" and "City Lights", both in fine <br/>
condition.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like "Hancock Hill" is still missing as the clue suggests. <br/>
Thanks to all posters for a great day!<br/>
