                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ever say hi to fellow hikers on the trail?  Then, when you reach the <br/>
next letterbox, realize the people to whom you just hi and the last to <br/>
sign in the letterbox log were one and the same?  We have started <br/>
humorously calling such a missed opportunity for personal stamp <br/>
Exchange a "Sighting"!!!<br/>
<br/>
We did indeed find "Moments to Celebrate" and felt it was an <br/>
appropriate place to celebrate after having recently completed an <br/>
inspiring "Dreamery" adventure!  We also located a little bird in "Grey <br/>
Reservation" and "Seal With A Kiss" has hitched a ride to RI with us.<br/>
<br/>
We were not so lucky searching for "Whale of a Time" in Garfield Woods <br/>
(Berlin, MA).  Its big old cave seemed bare and empty.  Perhaps if the <br/>
water level had been lower and the Sun hadn't been performing its daily <br/>
disappearing act, a more thorough search would have yielded results.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the MA folks for a great day out and hope to meet some of <br/>
them at one of the upcoming gatherings.<br/>
