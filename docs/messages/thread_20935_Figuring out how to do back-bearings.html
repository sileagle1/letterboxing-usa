This weekend I tried to find Walking Back the Cat l.b. in Wellfleet, <br/>
MA. I just want to run my seeking technique by all of you and ask for <br/>
advice. 2 objects are given as bearings. The box is a certain degree <br/>
position from each object. I walked in a circle around one reference <br/>
point until the correct reading was shown on my compass. I then kind <br/>
of paced backwards to a spot that looked like it might hold a <br/>
letterbox. Then had my husband do a rough compass reading from the <br/>
second reference point. In other words, we were rather unscientific <br/>
to say the least. I tried to think of the search in terms of <br/>
geometry: the lines from reference points to letterbox are the rays <br/>
of an angle, with the l.b. as the endpoint. It seemed like we should <br/>
have each had a compass, then backstepped from a reference point <br/>
until we bumped into eachother.  This would be where the box is <br/>
hidden. I did not find it but shall return in warmer brighter spring <br/>
time weather. Any comments on your experiences/techniques when  <br/>
searching for back-bearings boxes?  This was my first experience. <br/>
Thanks!<br/>

I did the same thing with the same box. walked around that field for <br/>
over an hour trying to find it. and there was 3 of us with 2 <br/>
compasses. Came up empty too. i emailed the placer and she was very <br/>
nice...told me how to do it but havn't had a chance to get back up <br/>
there. email her. thats your best bet :)<br/>

I do this a lot.  In surveying and mapping it's know as either a <br/>
resection or cross-bearings.  One way to do it is to stand at one of <br/>
the sighting points and face in the bearing direction.  Find a <br/>
natural landmark to walk towards.  Before you begin walking in that <br/>
direction set the compass to the other bearing.  Walk towards the <br/>
natural landmark until the second one lines up.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of Walking Back the Cat, you could stand at Landmark #1 <br/>
and face 212 degrees (32 + 180).  Walk in that direction with 139 <br/>
set on your compass and stop to check Landmark #2 as you get close. <br/>
<br/>
Another option is to stand far away from landmark #1 facing 32 <br/>
degrees and walk towards it with 139 set in the compass.  <br/>
<br/>
This is nothing.  I once had to set targets along Newark Bay so that <br/>
a tug captain could line up a drilling barge to do test borings on a <br/>
precisely coordinated spot.  It's all based on the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
