Yesterday I went out for a couple of letterboxes and found Dexter safe and sound. On checking out the abandoned letterboxes for possible adoption, I found the letterbox clues for Lincoln Penny floating around on the internet. It was set by the sample couple who put out  the abandoned Washington's Walkabout site.  After a full inspection of the site I can say Abe is MIA, but what a great spot for a letterbox. With so few letterboxes in the N/E corner of RI, I've been thinking of setting out a series at Lincoln Woods and would it be unethical to add the Lincoln Penny location to my series? <br/>

PS: If no one claims Washington's Walkabout I'd like to adopt the site. <br/>

I checked up on the box a few weeks ago and I agree, it's definitely <br/>
missing.  (It was the very first box I ever logged, so I know where <br/>
it should have been).<br/>

You might make more attempts to get in touch with the placer.  <br/>
Although I think she moved out of the area about a year ago, I <br/>
believe that Eric Eurto, aka Eric the Ram, is in touch with her.  You <br/>
might try contacting him.<br/>
