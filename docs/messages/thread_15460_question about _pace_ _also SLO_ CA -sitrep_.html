&gt; do most of you consider a pace as 1 <br/>
&gt; footfall?  And is a footfall just the length of a foot (like <br/>
placing <br/>
&gt; your feet end-to-end for the specified number of "paces"), or the <br/>
&gt; length of the step taken (between the feet)?  Am I making any <br/>
sense?  <br/>

Personally, a pace is approximately 30 inches, a pleasant measured <br/>
stride. Now there are folks who count a pace as the movement of both <br/>
feet, almost 60 in. <br/>

We had a great day today introducing our dear friend to letterboxing. <br/>
She has five finds as of today and two exchanges. Tomorrow, the <br/>
Redwall series. <br/>
<br/>
We also stopped in to Stamp Luis Obispo. They are getting more thin <br/>
Master Carve in soon. <br/>
<br/>
Boxes checked and healthy today:<br/>
<br/>
St. Patrick's Fliers (both are there, new clues soon)<br/>
Mr. Chong's Candy (book is kind of falling apart but lots of 'boxers <br/>
have been by)<br/>
Palme d'Or (very pretty stamp)<br/>
Pandora's Native American Bear (still there and healthy, much to our <br/>
amazement. We thought it would disappear in a week. That was almost 6 <br/>
mo. ago)<br/>
<br/>
Keep on boxing out there,<br/>
