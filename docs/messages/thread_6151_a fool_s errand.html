<div> Actually there are four boxes not three. 
These four were confiscated by the NPS from the Channel Islands .  Ron tried to 
pick them up but due to a bureaucratic foul up they had misplaced them in the 
NPS office. We thought the " clues " to their location should be placed with 
LBNA since he was heading to Arizona and Gwen &amp; I couldn't get up to Ventura 
. So if some eager letterboxer on the East coast wants to hop on a jet to LA , 
rent  a car ,drive to Ventura ( 2 hrs ) they can nail 4 hot letterboxes . 
What I was tempted to do --- ask for the boxes stamp in , then hand them back to 
the clerk, and leave .Don</div>

The 4 aforementioned boxes were liberated today.  No info on those <br/>
that Wisp o Will mentioned.<br/>
The Anacapa Island Lighthouse box will soon be en route to Portland, <br/>
to visit folks up there before retiring.  A portable <br/>
lighthouse...what a concept!<br/>
