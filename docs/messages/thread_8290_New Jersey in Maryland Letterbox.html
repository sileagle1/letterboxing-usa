<body>We hereby submit clues to a new
letterbox.<br/><br/>
<div align="center"><b>The New Jersey in Maryland Letterbox</b> <br/>
Frederick, Maryland <br/>
(Frederick County) <br/><br/>
</div>
This letterbox is planted in one acre of New Jersey that is in Maryland
by <br/>
deed - Planted September 14, 2002. <br/><br/>
Difficulty - Easy, but be discreet as the site is very visible. 
Don't get <br/>
the box when others are at the site, please. <br/><br/>
This acre was purchased by New Jersey folks who wanted to put up a
monument <br/>
to the New Jersey 14th Brigade of Union Troops who defended a bridge over
the <br/>
Monocacy River (which is just south of the monument).  After the
battle of <br/>
Gettysburg, the Union Army rushed to Virginia to capture Richmond.
General <br/>
Lee took this as an opportunity to send General Jubal Early's
Confederates to <br/>
march on Washington, DC.  The brave New Jersey soldiers held up the
<br/>
Confederate Army at the river long enough for the Union Army to get in
place <br/>
to defend Washington, and thus prevented the capture of the Northern
Capital. <br/>
The farmer who sold the land stipulated in the deed that the land must
remain <br/>
in the possession of New Jersey perpetually. <br/><br/>
History lesson over - on to the clues! <br/><br/>
The monument is located on the west side of Route 355, south of Frederick
and <br/>
north of Monocacy Battlefield Park.  It is between the Monocacy
River Bridge <br/>
and the railroad tracks.  Park in the lot. <br/><br/>
Go down the wooden steps.  Follow the stone wall to the first stone
post.  A <br/>
little more than a yard beyond, find small rocks sticking out at the
bottom <br/>
of the wall.  On the top of the wall above the small rocks, you will
see a <br/>
big rust-streaked stone shaped somewhat like the state of Kentucky. 
The <br/>
thing you seek is in the wall under  the stone behind
"Kentucky."  Good Luck! <br/><br/>
Be sure to replace the stones to completely cover the box as described in
the <br/>
clues, and then go read the plaques on the monument! <br/><br/>
This is our first box plant.  We hope it is successful as the NJ
troops were.  <br/>
