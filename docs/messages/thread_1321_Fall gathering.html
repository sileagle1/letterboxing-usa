Also for anyone interested EMS (Eastern Mountain Sports) is supposed to<br/>
be having a letterboxing meeting Oct 08, time to be announced at<br/>
Southpark Mall, Strongsville Ohio.Their phone number is 440-238-3621. I<br/>
believe this clinic or introduction to LB is in danger of being canceled.<br/>
Only one other person besides myself has signed up (Nancy if you're<br/>
listening call them and tell them not to cancel). Perhaps an encouraging<br/>
phone call would help ( hello you other EMS personnel). <br/>
I think this is a golden opportunity to promote this sport. Everything<br/>
starts somewhere. <br/>

I'll also send some advice on how to start it up out there. We had a little blurb in our EMS newsletter about "the article" in the Hartford Courant. Apparently it was well received at our home office up in Peterborough. Maybe it helped that I was wearing nothing but EMS garb as well in the picture. But anyway, I'll spread the good word and hit the speed dial a few times in the next few days! Wow, we could almost call this the Letterboxing Crusades!<br/>
