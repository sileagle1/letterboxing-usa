                    <div class="plaintext-content">(I accidentally sent this to Mitch only yesterday... so pretend that you <br/>
got it yesterday, Thursday)<br/>
<br/>
So today was the day.  I went to bed early last night in order to get an<br/>
early start.  I picked-up my Dad (he just celebrated his 75th birthday 2<br/>
days ago), and we were off in my little old CRX.  We decided to take the<br/>
coast route so that I could give you the surf report, as follows... <br/>
<br/>
Malibu - minus tide, 6" waves good form, too shallow!!<br/>
Zuma - also a minus tide as you would expect but it was hard to tell as the<br/>
beach drops off into the water somewhat abruptly.  Waves 1', closed-out<br/>
(OUCH!)<br/>
<br/>
So we find the trail head quite nicely, thanks to the mileage provided by<br/>
John (box owner).  Of course an SUV would have been more appropriate for the<br/>
"parking lot".  But of course my little car can do anything!!<br/>
<br/>
It is a beautiful morning, now that we are inland of the fog bank and the<br/>
area though very typical California scrub was beautiful (no blackberry<br/>
bushes).  We had a couple of rain storms very late in the season this year<br/>
so the hills were green (they are usually brown by July), and EVERYTHING was<br/>
blooming!!  There was a fair amount of wildlife about.  We saw many small<br/>
lizards, a beautiful black and yellow snake, butterflies, hawks,<br/>
hummingbirds (within arms reach, very cool), and various other birds that I<br/>
couldn't identify.  There was a lot of scat on the trail.  Someone was<br/>
finding a lot of furry critters to eat, per the evidence, though we never<br/>
saw who the scat belonged to.  Probably coyotes.  Possibly large wild cats.<br/>
<br/>
So, we are making VERY SLOW progress due to my inappropriate physical shape<br/>
for such an undertaking.  Just before we came upon the first landmark, I<br/>
realized that I was not going to make it.  I hiked a little further during<br/>
my short-lived state-of-denial but it was too HOT and I am TOO FAT to go any<br/>
further.  My Dad of course was fine and could have continued but I am too<br/>
pathetic!!  He admitted to me back in the car that when he read that we<br/>
hadn't even arrived at the steepest part of the trail that he probably<br/>
wouldn't have wanted to go any further either, not on such a hot day.  We<br/>
did decide that late afternoon hike would afford more shade and certainly<br/>
would have been much cooler.  But I think I'll shed 100 lbs, and wait for<br/>
late winter or spring before I try again.<br/>
<br/>
I am so sorry John that I failed to be able to report on your box, not to<br/>
mention get to stamp in my book, or stamp in the box's book.  I totally<br/>
understand if you would rather check on your box when you are here in town,<br/>
rather than hunt for the one that I'm putting out.  I know that your time is<br/>
limited.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned many lessons... read a topography map before going, that<br/>
"moderate" hike to a fat person like me is an "impossible" hike, morning is<br/>
not cool enough in the summer around here, DON'T WEAR A BLACK T-Shirt<br/>
(Duh!!), bring as much water as I can possible carry, my father is going to<br/>
outlive me, don't let those flies with the gray head sit on you THEY<br/>
BITE!!!, I am much more of a dope than I realized, however long I think that<br/>
it is going to take triple it, DON'T EVER LET THE LETTERBOX GROUP KNOW THAT<br/>
YOU ARE GOING FOR A HUNT UNTIL AFTER THE HUNT (and of course only tell about<br/>
the successful hunts, just kidding...kind of).<br/>
<br/>
Well we (Daddy and I) are going to continue to hike every week in order to<br/>
improve my condition and search out good box sites.  I am not at all<br/>
discouraged!!!<br/>
<br/>
I hope that you all have a wonderful and safe 4th of July weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Less than a Newbie,  Wendy<br/>

I am looking forward to a cooler hunt.  It would be just my luck that the<br/>
weekend that I'm there you will get a record heat wave.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;ouch....  don't think we have those... of course our mosquitos are<br/>

I'll start taking my B complex today.  I hate mosquitoes!!<br/>

I didn't say that I wouldn't continue to try....<br/>

Thanks for the encouragement, I love adventures also even if the goal is not<br/>

Glad you liked my story.  I may be up in Portland occasionally as one of my<br/>
clients is up there (this trip is to celebrate his 40th birthday).  Of<br/>
course if you are down in LA we can swap CRX stories too.  My baby is the<br/>
1.5 '84 model.  GREAT CAR!!!  She's starting to look her age and needs some<br/>
work.<br/>

<br/>
Dear Wendy,<br/>
Thanks for sharing your lessons with us.  And a special thank you for your <br/>
candor and honesty.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned to the group recently that I placed a stamp with the wrong date <br/>
on it, but didn't explain the situation very well.  I would like to take this <br/>
time to elaborate.<br/>
<br/>
When I decided to take up letterboxing last year, I knew right away where my <br/>
first letterbox would go... beautiful Multnomah Falls.  I decided to place <br/>
the box in a very accessable area that requires no hiking.  But I had also <br/>
read about the wonderful hiking trails in the area that led to even more <br/>
waterfalls.  I made note of a few of the waterfalls that I wanted to visit, <br/>
and went ahead and carved a stamp for each of them.  Since it was summertime, <br/>
I felt confident in carving the numerals 1998 onto each stamp.  There were <br/>
still 4.5 months left in the year, after all.<br/>
<br/>
Starting at Horsetail Falls, I found the nearest trailhead and began hiking <br/>
up the hillside.  I was terribly out of shape and overweight.  In no time at <br/>
all I was struggling with every step and sweating profusely.  I had to take a <br/>
break.  I found a quiet side trail, trudged along a few more laborious paces, <br/>
and then planted my panting frame on a convenient rock.  This was going to <br/>
have to be location of the Horsetail Falls box, I told myself.  I still had <br/>
two more waterfalls to find, and recognized that I needed to conserve my <br/>
energy.<br/>
<br/>
After locating a hiding spot and jotting down the clues, I reluctantly moved <br/>
on.  By the time I reached Ponytail Falls, I was hurting.  I managed to find <br/>
a place to hide the next letterbox and virtually collapsed onto the ground.  <br/>
I laid with my back to the ground breathing hard and feeling like I would not <br/>
be able to get up again.  My clothes were so sweaty that I soon realized the <br/>
dusty ground where I had landed was rapidly turning into a mudpuddle.<br/>
<br/>
It's a good thing nobody came hiking along about then.  They probably would <br/>
have ran for a phone, called 911, and had me airlifted off the hillside.  It <br/>
would have been a disturbing sight for someone to have found me lying there <br/>
in all my fatness, my hair soaked with sweat and my clothes caked in mud.  To <br/>
tell the truth, I think I may have even dozed off for several minutes.  After <br/>
resting for about half an hour, I finally managed to raise my muddy self up <br/>
onto two feet again.  From there, I set out for my final destination: Triple <br/>
Falls.<br/>
<br/>
I tried.  I really tried.  Each footstep had become sheer pain.  The mild <br/>
incline of the trail made it seem as though I were scaling a cliff.  When I <br/>
reached the point that I couldn't go any further without stopping again, I <br/>
looked back and realized that I could still see the place where I had just <br/>
been resting.  I felt like I'd marched another 5 miles, but I had actually <br/>
only paced a few dozen yards further.  Suddenly it hit me...  I wasn't going <br/>
to make it.  I was fat.  I was getting old.  Over the years, my butt had <br/>
somehow molded itself into the same shape as the office chair that it usually <br/>
filled.  What had happened to the energetic, normally-proportioned young man <br/>
that I had once been?<br/>
<br/>
Thank God the trail back down went easier than it had been going up.  <br/>
Otherwise, they might have found my body rotting in the summer sun alongside <br/>
the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, it would be fair to say that I have become obsessed with <br/>
letterboxing.  I take walks all the time looking for places to hide my next <br/>
box.  I've remembered what it's like to spend time outdoors.  And, gradually, <br/>
I've felt my energy grow and my endurance increase.  Don't get me wrong... I <br/>
could still stand to lose some weight.  But I feel better than I have in <br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
As most of you who have been monitoring this list know, I made it to Triple <br/>
Falls this year.  I made it to the point where I had collapsed last time <br/>
without even breaking a sweat.  And, except for a quick check of last years <br/>
letterboxes, I made it all the way to Triple Falls without having to take a <br/>
rest.  When I got there, I hid the stamp that I had made a year earlier.  I <br/>
put a note in the logbook to explain the discrepancy in dates.  As I sat up <br/>
there in the forest with my tired feet soaking in the water near Triple <br/>
Falls, I realized that I couldn't have made it if I hadn't been walking <br/>
around looking for letterbox hiding places all year.  Letterboxing had <br/>
changed who I was and what I could do.  Letterboxing had made me a better <br/>
person.  Letterboxing may very well have SAVED MY LIFE!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Have faith, Wendy.  Keep your spirits up and hang on to your determination <br/>
and enthusiasm.  Start hiding and hunting boxes, beginning with simple ones <br/>
and progressing to longer and longer hikes.  (Don't over-do it like I did <br/>
that first time!!!)  The change will be gradual.  You'll hardly notice, at <br/>
first.  But, in time, the trails will seem easier.  You will find yourself <br/>
longing for your next hike.  One day, you will even make it to the Circle X <br/>
letterbox.<br/>

Don't worry my enthusiasm wasn't even slightly waned  AND I will get that<br/>
Circle X letterbox some day!!!<br/>

I'll be there in early August to visit one of my clients, but it looks<br/>
like a "speed run."  I'll let you know if I'll have time to play.<br/>
<br/>
off topic (sorry... I'm a car guy, can't help it): I got my CRX-Si in<br/>
'85 after riding in my good friend's '84.  We were screaming down Hwy 60<br/>
to LA from Riverside and I was very impressed when he wound it up to 100<br/>
mph and the little shoebox car remained rock steady and as happy as it<br/>
had been at 55 mph.  I trusted his judgement, even though he had driven<br/>
us off a small cliff in the mountains one night in his Fiat (well... we<br/>
lived).  I waivered briefly between the Honda and the newly redesigned<br/>
VW-GTI.  The Honda was purchased though, for various reasons, and our<br/>
exploits together were legion.  I won't bore you with them here....<br/>

<br/>
Thanks very much for sharing your story with us. Sorry you didn't <br/>
make it to the box, but there will be another time. Your description <br/>
of the hillside and the hike was beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks also for the comments on Cadillac Mtn. It's a great location <br/>
 - and having a road to the top ain't so bad either  :o)<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

Well, I think I'll start the awkward carver's club.  I did a stamp this<br/>
weekend (with lots of lettering on it) and didn't notice until I finished<br/>
that I transposed two words on it.  Well, I'm not going to re-carve the<br/>

Wendy: Thanks for the story.  Your honesty and willingness to share a story<br/>
and refreshing.  My opionion: trying is 80% of the battle.  If you have the<br/>
will to try, the rest is relatively easy.  You obviously have the will to<br/>
try!  The rest will come.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt;Thanks so much for sharing your adventure with us all.  You've started<br/>
&gt;quite the cathartic trend!<br/>
<br/>
Thank You for the adventure!!  I didn't realize that there would be such a<br/>
nice outpour of sympathy and empathy.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;Don't let this little mishap (;o) stop you from hiding that box you<br/>
&gt;were working on.  I'm going to try and fit both checking on Circle X &amp;<br/>
&gt;your box into my schedule.  <br/>
<br/>
I was still planning to hide the box that I've been talking about.  Daddy<br/>
and I are going up to do just that this Thursday.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;BTW, how hot does it get up there in the mountains in the summer?  Your<br/>
&gt;assumption about shade is right; I placed the box rather late in the<br/>
&gt;day, and that side of the mountain got quite a bit of shade.<br/>
<br/>
Well to me it felt like 150 degrees, though I think it was maybe 85, and I'm<br/>
sure that it gets over 100 on days that the Santa Ana's are blowing. <br/>
Afternoon would be the best time to go. It looked like to us that the sun<br/>
would get behind the hill in most places around 3:30 or so. Sunset around<br/>
here is a little after 8:00 with at least 30-45 minutes of twilight.  If you<br/>
go up from where you are staying the drive up from Hwy 1 is fun.  We turned<br/>
right on Decker to Mulholand Hwy to Little Sycamor.  If you miss the Decker<br/>
turn, Mulhuland Hwy turn is just on the other side of Leo Carrillo State<br/>
Beach.<br/>
<br/>
I'll post the clues to my 1st box Thursday.<br/>
<br/>
See you soon,  Wendy<br/>

<br/>
At STAMPFEST (the rubber stamp carving retreat that I have mentioned before)<br/>
we all encourage each other with the concept of HAPPY GOOFS, they add<br/>
character and give us all a good giggle.  Re-carving is un-heard of accept<br/>
when the "anal-carvers" goof.  They rarely admit to their goof though they<br/>
are usually quite moody at lunch, and sometimes the evidence is found in the<br/>
trash.<br/>

ROFLOL!!<br/>
Well I again float my suggestion for a "goofs' page on the website. This<br/>
is TOO funny!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I am glad so many letterboxes were salted or found on this<br/>
past weekend. Congrats to ypu all.<br/>
<br/>
I started a couple during the mid-week - to go in Central Mass, with a<br/>
Am. Revolution theme (I missed the Fourth - Dang!).  Well, at least I<br/>
started!<br/>
