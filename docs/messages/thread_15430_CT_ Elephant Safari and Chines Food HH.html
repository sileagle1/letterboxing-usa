yesterday. We had intended to check out some favorite musicals but <br/>
forgot the clues!!!  We stopped at Ye Old Cemetary to find a lovely <br/>
stamp by Chuck and Molly that was unfortunately broken in half! <br/>
<br/>
We then headed up for the Elephant Safari and found all boxes in the <br/>
north and south sections to be in awesome shape. Very nice job Chuck <br/>
and Molly!!!!    We found the "Chinese Food to go" Hitch Hiker at the <br/>
Shep box in the north section and it will be on its way shortly.<br/>
<br/>
The hike at the elephants was incredible - our new favorite second <br/>
only to Hartman.  The trails were well marked and easy to follow. The <br/>
clues are perfect!  Although we did see a brown recluse spider <br/>
sitting on the 2nd box ( the one up by the dam ) so be careful out <br/>
there and carry a walking stick! Its a great investment and/or find!<br/>
