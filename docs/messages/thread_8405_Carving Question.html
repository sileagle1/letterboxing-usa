                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wondering what to use to give the effect of shading -- a fine <br/>
distortion on the stamp surface.  I tried sandpaper and maybe I'm not <br/>
doing it right, but I get either no effect at all (not much rub) or a <br/>
badly crumbled carving (too much rub).  I've been using a paperclip <br/>
end and various size needles, etc. to make holes in my stamp and <br/>
create the effect of bushes, trees and so on, but that leaves a <br/>
defined hole, not quite the effect I am looking for. <br/>
<br/>
Would be interested to hear what others have used for a shading <br/>
effect.  Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
This is the soft-block carver's most common problem! Some use a pin and<br/>
poke dots galore, and some do cross-hatching, which is what I do. I take<br/>
my #1 Speedball gouge and LIGHTLY skim the surface in parallel lines<br/>
(spacing is up to you -- the closer they are, the lighter the area will<br/>
be), and then I LIGHTLY skim the surface in a perpendicular direction --<br/>
giving a crosshatch effect. You can also use an X-Acto blade, but I don't <br/>
find that as effective.<br/>

"pink stuff"), but it uses a lot of shading, including the crosshatch<br/>
technique.<br/>

1. Do not make the area sandy-grainy looking. Either don't use that<br/>
part of the image or incorporate it a different way. Ex. use color<br/>
markers when stamping to make that part of the image different.<br/>
2. Use cross-hatching instead of the grainy look.<br/>
3. You can make the grainy look by using a syringe to poke holes out<br/>
to simulate the grainy look.<br/>

this.  The bigger the needle and more blunt the tip, the larger the <br/>
holes and more white space you will get.  Just poke the area full of <br/>
holes -- more or less depending on how grainy you want it to look.  <br/>
I keep a piece of felt with about 8 different sized needles on in my <br/>
carving kit and use them quite a bit for shading effects.<br/>
<br/>
One hint when doing this -- use the needles or Exacto knife to do <br/>
the puncturing BEFORE you carve away the surrounding areas.  This <br/>
will give you a more even distribution of shading.  If you carve <br/>
away the surrounding areas first, the poked holes will tend to be <br/>
concentrated in the center of the shaded area because it is more <br/>
difficult to get close to the edges.<br/>
<br/>
I have also heard of people using sandpaper, but personally have not <br/>
had very good success with that.<br/>

who have been doing it for years.<br/>
<br/>
When we first started letterboxing two years ago we got a block of <br/>
Speedball's Speedy Carve (it was the only thing carried locally) and <br/>
used 1/4 of it to carve our son a stamp.  By the end of the year the <br/>
ear had broken off.  I recently found the rest of the block and <br/>
decided to try carving a new stamp out of it, but all it did was <br/>
crumble and break off in chunks, which got me wondering about the <br/>
longevity of carving medium.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me how well the Speedball Speedy Stamp (pink stuff) <br/>
and the Staedler MasterCarve holds up over the years?  These are my <br/>
choice mediums and just wondered how often I may have to replace the <br/>
stamps I carve from them.<br/>
<br/>
What recommendations would you give for a medium that will hold up <br/>
for years to come?<br/>

The Speedy-Carve is junk.  It crumbles and falls apart in no time, as <br/>
you have found.<br/>
<br/>
I carved my Sig Stamp out of Speedy-Stamp (AKA The Pink Stuff) and it <br/>
has held up very well after two years and thousands of stampings.  <br/>
Mastercarve also holds well from what I can tell.  These days I prefer <br/>
PZ Cut which works best for my particular carving style.    Whichever <br/>
you chose, just stay away from that Speedy-Carve stuff.<br/>

I have stamps carved from PZKUT in the great outdorrs that I carved in<br/>
2001 and they seem to be holding up just fine.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that PZKUT does get a little hard over time though.<br/>
<br/>
The racoons just love PZKUT too...<br/>
