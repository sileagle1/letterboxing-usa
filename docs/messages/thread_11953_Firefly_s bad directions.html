In my defense, I would like to mention that one major street was closed due <br/>
to all the protests in DC.  Had it not been closed, I might have had an <br/>
easier time getting us to the Postal Museum!  Also, Psychomommy's map was <br/>
very hard to read!  Maybe this Firefly should have brought her glasses!!!<br/>

I just wanted to take the scenic route!!!<br/>
