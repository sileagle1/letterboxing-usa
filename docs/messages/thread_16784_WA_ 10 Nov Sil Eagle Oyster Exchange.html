                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just got home from the last minute letterboxing event in Olympia, WA <br/>
and was delighted that, despite the driving rain in the region, 15 <br/>
folks were able to join us for such a hastily arranged event so we <br/>
could offer the visiting Silver Eagle a warm welcome to the region. <br/>
Oysters were shucked, microbrews were gulped and the stamping frenzy <br/>
began unabatedly...<br/>
<br/>
It was so cool to finally meet Silver Eagle in person after<br/>
following his letterboxing pursuits all around the Lone Star State<br/>
(our previous home) over the past year. What an incredible<br/>
whirlwind Pacific Northwest trek he is currently on (how many<br/>
letterboxes did he manage to visit since he landed at SeaTac<br/>
yesterday--20, 30 or more? Wow!!!) while he's in the region.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, folks (Fudrick, Mummsie, trkee, rnrB, trkr, jessi, the<br/>
Moores, RayvenMom, RayvenDad, Nailhead &amp; Happy Mom), for joining us<br/>
in meeting Silver Eagle and we hope you enjoyed your time--I<br/>
certainly did! ;) I'm a bit bummed that I just realized I forgot to<br/>
take pictures at the event AND I had my camera on me...well, in the<br/>
words of Dierks Bentley--"What was I thinkin'?" :)<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, we'll be able to visit some more with everybody on<br/>
Saturday morning, 15 Nov 03, at Wapato Park in Tacoma from 0930-1030<br/>
near the Greek Columns by the Eastern entrance.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails soon,<br/>
