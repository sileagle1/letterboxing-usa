can't seem to get on the new site to post it, so here are the clues for<br/>
all you gathering people and I'll post it after the main event.<br/>
Red Sky at Night<br/>
Planted by Rubaduc<br/>
carved by RTRW<br/>

Red sky at night<br/>
 letterboxers delight (I'm hoping for red tonight)<br/>
Red sky in the morning<br/>
 letterboxers take warning (but go boxing anyway)<br/>
<br/>
The Meadows Trail is almost directly opposite the Meadows Pavilion where<br/>
we will gather, just cross the park road and head into the woods on the<br/>
trail which soon becomes yellow blazed. There are a few side trails most<br/>
of which lead you to the hi way but just stay on yellow. Lots of good<br/>
hiding spots but there's a small stretch of uphill to climb first. When<br/>
you get to an intersection of the west trail go left on Meadows and<br/>
follow the power lines for a bit. When the lines leave the trail you'll<br/>
see a birdhouse on a tree on the left and a stone wall on your right and<br/>
a gravel path ahead. Standing with your back to the birdhouse (not too<br/>
near in case of nesting) site 140 degrees to a larger than normal rock in<br/>
the wall. The box will be hidden in the southwest corner. <br/>
Take the path, also yellow blazed  and soon you'll be back at the<br/>
pavilion.<br/>
This shouldn't take more than 15 min.<br/>
