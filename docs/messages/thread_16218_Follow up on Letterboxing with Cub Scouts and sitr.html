                    <div class="plaintext-content">The letterboxing was a huge hit with our Wolf Den!  At<br/>
the end of the campout, when the boys were asked what<br/>
their favorite activities had been, the Wolves<br/>
unanimous response was "letterboxing"!<br/>
<br/>
We had seven boys, so we divided them up into three<br/>
groups and sent them off into the wilds (okay, the<br/>
mildly wilds) with clues, a compass, a little notebook<br/>
for each, and an adult in tow.  My daughter hung out<br/>
in a central location and I roamed the trails to help<br/>
the truly stymied, with the stipulation that if they<br/>
asked for help, we would ask them for something in<br/>
return, like a shoelace or a nose hair or something. <br/>
We didn't want to make it too easy to ask for help,<br/>
but we wanted to make sure they would find each box!<br/>
<br/>
I was afraid that our clues would a) be too easy and<br/>
they would breeze through the boxes, or b) be too<br/>
difficult and they wouldn't enjoy it, or c) the adults<br/>
would get too involved and do most of the work,<br/>
despite our instructions to be there for safety<br/>
purposes only.  The adults did a great job of staying<br/>
out of it, only stepping in when the kids got off in<br/>
left field, usually with the compass readings.  No one<br/>
clue was too difficult, although each group had an<br/>
enormous amount of trouble with one clue, that one<br/>
clue being different for each group.  I thought that<br/>
was REALLY interesting!  It took them about 2 hours to<br/>
find all the boxes, which were hidden within a half<br/>
mile radius.<br/>
<br/>
We did run into an unexpected problem which made me<br/>
glad we didn't try to find the two "real" boxes<br/>
permanently planted in the park.  There was a large<br/>
family reunion going on in the park and also a group<br/>
of inner city kids that was camping with a couple of<br/>
adults.  Although our boys were relatively discreet<br/>
about finding boxes (as discreet as you could hope 7<br/>
year olds could be), the inner city boys noticed them<br/>
roaming and searching and got very interested in what<br/>
they were doing.  They tagged along behind one group,<br/>
so I filled them in on what they were doing - treasure<br/>
hunting for stickers.  That satisfied them somewhat,<br/>
especially after they got a peek at a box and saw that<br/>
there really was just a little notebook and a bunch of<br/>
stickers in the box.  The family reunion folks were<br/>
all over the place, so it was difficult at times to<br/>
pull the boxes out and thumbprint into them.  The boys<br/>
didn't do so well with being patient while waiting for<br/>
the area to clear out, but the adults managed to sit<br/>
on them and make them wait.<br/>
<br/>
I went out early and found Babybear's box, which was<br/>
fairly close to our campsite.  I took it back to camp<br/>
with me to show them as I got ready to send them out,<br/>
so they would see what our activity was mimicking. <br/>
They were intrigued by the handcarved stamp and<br/>
totally enthralled when I showed them the book and how<br/>
my family had stamped in about a month ago (no one had<br/>
stamped in since, so we are still the only visitors!),<br/>
especially when I took my own stamp and book out of my<br/>
backpack and showed them where I had taken the box's<br/>
stamp and stamped in to my book as well.  I was<br/>
surprised how psyched up seeing this real stuff!  I<br/>
then sent them off in one direction and returned the<br/>
box to its home.<br/>
<br/>
As to the conditions of the two boxes in the park -<br/>
Silver Eagle's Spanish Flag and BabyBear's Tejas -<br/>
both boxes were well-hidden and in great condition. <br/>
Dry inside despite some rains we've had since the last<br/>
time we visited them.  My family is still the only<br/>
visitors to these boxes - hint, hint!<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm really glad we got out and did this with our<br/>
den.  I look forward to hearing how it goes with your<br/>
group Deb, and anyone else who is thinking of giving<br/>
it a try with Cub Scouts!<br/>

&lt;&lt; The letterboxing was a huge hit with our Wolf Den! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh I'm so glad!  I hope I have the same reacting from our Webelos Scouts next <br/>
weekend!<br/>
<br/>
I've got three stamps carved.  A campfire one--I'm going to try to <br/>
incorporate some questions about how to build a fire in the clues.  A fish one--going <br/>
for fishing questions on that one.  And a Boy Scout fleur de lis, which will <br/>
have questions about Boy Scout requirements.  My biggest problem is when I can <br/>
hide the boxes.  It's quite a drive up to the park, and my schedule this week is <br/>
pretty full.  I may have to try to get there semi early on Friday, set up our <br/>
tent, and hide the boxes before I have to rush home again to attend our <br/>
karate school's belt graduation, and then trot back up to the campout.  Whew!<br/>
<br/>
The park we're in is having a "Bed and Breakfast" weekend where they have a <br/>
package deal for campsite, hayride, and breakfast in the morning, so there'll <br/>
probably be plenty of families and kids around, but our site is separate from <br/>
the main campground, so we'll see how it goes.<br/>
<br/>
And our area needs future letterboxers even more than Texas, does, I think!<br/>
