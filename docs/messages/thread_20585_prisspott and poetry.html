TeamWARE has a poetry LB out there and though it's not<br/>
pro and the rhyming pattern isn't dead on....it's<br/>
still a piece of who we are....and isn't that the<br/>
point in all of this?  Planting a piece of ourselves<br/>
in hopes to bring joy, excitement, and wonder to those<br/>
who "choose" (key word) to search for the hidden<br/>
treasure?<br/>
<br/>
Poetry, though it can be poorly written at times is<br/>
still poetry because it's an expression in written<br/>
form of another person at a particular moment in their<br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
To say someone's poem didn't "do it for ya" is<br/>
invalidating that person's experience, their<br/>
expression, and their willingness to share a bit of<br/>
themselves with the rest of the world.<br/>

Her Ladyship must be having a rotten day - it is true that not all<br/>
poems are created equal - but don't let Miss Priss(pot) ;-) stop you<br/>
from creating. I say, the more practice you have in poetry writing,<br/>
the better you get.<br/>
<br/>
I myself have probably written some awful awful stuff, but yet - I put<br/>
it out there in all it's glory. I think that is some of the appeal of<br/>
letterboxing for me. It's about putting your artwork out there and<br/>
your ideas, no matter what level. This unusual hobby covers all types<br/>
of people and places, and the bottom line is - if you don't like the<br/>
clue or the style of the box - you don't have to find it.<br/>
<br/>
Goodness knows Miss PrissPot - take it easy my dear. <br/>

Heavens to Betsy! Her Ladyship said it was a suggestion AND said<br/>
please. Her Ladyship still reserves the right to her opinion. Please,<br/>
gentlefolk, remember that her Ladyship expressed an opinion and asked<br/>
that one evaluate one's literary skills before they succumb to<br/>
Calliope's charms.<br/>
<br/>
Now if you'll excuse her Ladyship we must get back to solving all the<br/>
worlds problems.<br/>
