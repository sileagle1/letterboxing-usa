mind us crowding in, but that is the kind of place that could be home <br/>
to a lot of letterboxes. It's easy to get to, fun to hike, has <br/>
marvelous views, and is loaded with nooks and crannies. BTW, we were <br/>
amazed at the synchronicity when we saw your stamp...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The Blue Hills Reservation is a treasure of easily accessed open <br/>
space close to Boston, with truly wonderful views of Boston's Harbor <br/>
Islands and skyline. Since this is the type of place that could <br/>
easily support a plethora of letterboxes, we thought we would add a <br/>
second box to the one already placed by Jeremy and Greta.<br/>
<br/>
On I-93 just "north" of the I-95 junction, take exit #2 and head <br/>
north on Rte. 138 a short distance to park on the right at the Trail <br/>
Museum parking lot. Pick up an excellent map at the museum, or sketch <br/>
a copy of the one posted at the trailhead. The trails into the <br/>
reservation are steep, but families with children often climb them. <br/>
Please use care in winter as the routes are quite slippery with the <br/>
slightest hint of ice or snow.<br/>
<br/>
Find your way to Jeremy and Greta's "Blue Hills Letterbox."<br/>
( http://www.whiteblazes.com/lbna/bluehills.html )<br/>
<br/>
After stamping in at Wolcott Hill, throw a smooth stone as hard as <br/>
you can to the east - it should land on 1120. Walk down Wolcott Hill <br/>
either way to pick it up, and stand exactly in the center of that <br/>
intersection. Take about 45 steps on 070 degrees, then turn 90 <br/>
degrees towards the south. Walk a few steps to the obvious landmark <br/>
and check low under the eastern overhang for your reward.<br/>
