Last weekend we were in Columbia, MO and looked for the one at Rockbridge Park, and was very disappointed when we didn't find it.  Today we went to the Zoo and found our first letterbox.  ROAR was great, but was a litttle damp.  The Longest Neck was great, we had a fun time pretending to tie our shoes and get the boxes.  If you haven't been in a while I strongly recommend a trip by the Puffin &amp; Penguin coast.  It was great fun to see the penguins that close.  It's the only one like itself around the country.  <br/>
<br/>
We then went and looked for the one a Paul A Shroeder park in Manchester.  We didn't find this one.  We looked everywhere around, but it wasn't found.  And finally on the way home we stopped at Bluebird Park in Ellisville.  We had great fun on this one and we think we were the first finders of this one.  <br/>
<br/>
Overall a beautiful fall day to go letterboxing!<br/>
