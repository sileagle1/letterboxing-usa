Finally getting time to announce our "Letterboxing Lifetime<br/>
Achievement Award" for those who have gone WAY "above and beyond" in<br/>
establishing and promoting our special hobby!  As the name implies,<br/>
this letterbox is not for any single "best show" or accomplishment,<br/>
but for those who have put in a long time commitment and contributed<br/>
EXTRAORDINARILY in the best spirit of letterboxing.  The standards we<br/>
have chosen are purposefully very high to acknowledge those few<br/>
individuals who have already attained them, and those who are<br/>
following in their footsteps.  They include:<br/>
<br/>
1.   A time commitment of having been involved in letterboxing for a<br/>
minimum of 5 years (this is, after all, a "lifetime" achievement<br/>
award, so "time-in" definitely counts!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
2.   A creative output of 100 or more "equal opportunity / equal<br/>
chance" letterbox plants (i.e., "complete" letterboxes planted with<br/>
stamps, logbook and clues which are available freely and openly to the<br/>
general public - not hitchers, WOM's, PLBs or such like things which<br/>
only move in select circles, but rather those boxes that fit the<br/>
original LbNA philosophy proposed by Erik and Susan Davis, whereby<br/>
"any child can go to a computer, print out clues, and take a parent on<br/>
an adventure", or something like that - whether they actually find the<br/>
box or not!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
3.  A minimum combined count of PFX 500, as listed on our web page<br/>
(see http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html ), which we feel is<br/>
a good indication of a "well rounded letterboxer", who not only plants<br/>
but takes the time to see what other letterboxers have planted, and<br/>
makes an effort to meet some of them as well.<br/>
<br/>
4.   A spirit of graciousness and kindness that has been beneficial to<br/>
the letterboxing community (we certainly don't care to honor anyone<br/>
who would use letterboxing to intentionally cause trouble, hurt or<br/>
harm to others - this award is for people of "high quality character"!<br/>
 :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we will be announcing this year's honorary recipients of the<br/>
"Letterboxing Lifetime Achievement Award" sometime next week.  I think<br/>
everyone will agree that these special people definitely "fit the<br/>
bill" and deserve a little recognition for all their hard work of the<br/>
"early years" that so many other letterboxers have now been building<br/>
upon!  More next week ...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I first learned about letterboxing in an article in Southern Living a year<br/>
or so ago. I had previously heard about geocaching, but it sounded too<br/>
techie and expensive for me, and I forgot about it. Anyway, the letterboxing<br/>
article really grabbed my attention, and after researching and getting my<br/>
courage up, I carved a stamp and set out. I'm in Texas, and I found a number<br/>
of stamps carved by Silver Eagle and Baby Bear on my first boxing adventure.<br/>
The boxes were fun to find, and in family-friendly locations. Needless to<br/>
say, I was hooked!<br/>
<br/>
So, here is big, list-wide salute to Silver Eagle and Baby Bear, who brought<br/>
letterboxing to Houston, and have carved and planted numerous boxes, in<br/>
addition to hosting our annual Texas Letterboxing event!  Thanks! Y'all are<br/>
great!<br/>
<br/>
JOY<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I'm sure you are wrong about no one caring about your opinion- this is<br/>
a big list and sometimes it gets a little nasty. When it does, I exercise my<br/>
right to use my delete button :-)   <br/>

<br/>
Here's my two cents though no one asked and I'm sure few care.<br/>
<br/>
Oscars are chosen by secret ballot and tabulated by a impartial <br/>
auditing firm. <br/>
<br/>
So, since that doesn't seem to be the case here, this would be another <br/>
way to grandstand taking the focus off the persons who started this <br/>
hobby or have advanced it while keeping the true essence of the game <br/>
and putting it back on the "big show" so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
Why not we *ALL* just take a minute, think of those who have influenced <br/>
us and our thinking in this hobby and take a few minutes out of our <br/>
busy lives to write them a nice email or, if we know their address, <br/>
send them a token of our appreciation- a RAK of sorts- a postcard with <br/>
an image we've created just for them, a hand created thank you card... <br/>
the ways of saying thank you are limitless.<br/>
<br/>
Your mileage may vary.<br/>

Ahh, this certainly points up the beauty of letterboxing. Some folks <br/>
like to count Fs, some like to carve and plant,some are into long <br/>
hikes, others like drivebys, others send out oscars, or stick to <br/>
private notes of appreciation. The diversification is another plus <br/>
for letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; the ways of saying thank you are limitless.<br/>
<br/>
Yes they are limitless, so why not just leave it at that. If someone <br/>
wants to publically recognize a founder or longtime letterboxer what <br/>
is the harm? There are several people that have put in many hours of <br/>
work moderating, or inputting clues(in the past), working behind the <br/>
scenes that deserve more recognition for their efforts. Who better <br/>
to set up this award than someone that has taken full advantage of a <br/>
vast number of letterboxes and thus the efforts of those folks?<br/>

Don, you say it so well.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to add that if it wasn't for these people, it wouldn't be <br/>
possible for someone like me to enter and play.  It would give me <br/>
great pleasure to see honors given to those special people (and I <br/>
don't come near to qualifying for the same honor, btw), because <br/>
stand-outs should be recognized.  It's not a contest or race to see <br/>
who gets what, it's saying "Thank You".  Not only is this award for <br/>
the long standing boxer who is well rounded, but one who also has a <br/>
special quality spelled out in rule #4 . . . . this is what makes the <br/>
award so meaningful.<br/>
