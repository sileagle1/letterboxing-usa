    We did it I admit and even though I may spend a whole day <br/>
tommorow shoveling I'm still happy. Merry White Christmas all!  The <br/>
Cowboy who missed all but one day of the previous snows can't wait to <br/>
get out in it tommorow! Santa saw the forecast and left a new sled by <br/>
the fireplace.  To our delight many supplies for letterboxing were <br/>
exchanged between pink trotters and myself we are ready to  populate <br/>
another park. First I need to finish the Gazebo series so you can all <br/>
build yourselves one for the new year.  <br/>
   To all our friends in the letterboxing world peace on earth and <br/>
happy holidays.   Leader of the Pack  Carol <br/>

This is where my suggestion for lead lining the letterboxes will come in <br/>
handy...<br/>
All letterboxers would have to be equipped with a metal detector.  So when <br/>
you're near the box, under that foot of snow...you'd be able to find it <br/>
quickly...<br/>
<br/>
It would also make letterboxers easier to identify on the trails...who else <br/>
would be carrying a metal detector?<br/>
<br/>

P.S.  In spite of the snow...I'm still gonna try to place some boxes this <br/>
weekend...<br/>

Hi Folks. I am new to the list. I have been an avid Geocacher for about a
year. I just discovered Letterboxing was still going on. I am going to
start letterboxing in addition to Geocaching. I was just curious as to
whether since 9-11 and letterboxes have been blown up by bomb squads.
Several Geocaches have been. Tomorrow first thing I am off to the store
to purchase an eraser to make a stamp. I noticed from the ones I looked
at on the website that most seem to be in and around cities. Are
mountains which require a hike also places folks hide them. I am an avid
backpacker, Hiker and Mountain biker. there are many geocaches in the
mountains and I have placed about 7in the mountains in Va. It is great
when you can combine two or more interests together. Also what about
caves ? I am also an avid caver. One last question . I noticed the clues
on the ones I read were actually specific directions to the box. Are
cryptic clues, riddles etc. also aloowed. You know something that
requires so detective work ? Sorry about all the questions. Hope everyone
had a nice Christmas. Take care !!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome to the wonderful world of letterboxing!  Once you really get <br/>
started, you'll wonder why you thought geocaching was so great.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I was just curious as to whether since 9-11 and letterboxes have<br/>
&gt; been blown up by bomb squads. <br/>
<br/>
None that I'm aware of, but I did hear rumors about someone thinking <br/>
it was a drug drop or something so the cops came in with rubber <br/>
gloves to investigate it.  (I don't know any details such as when, <br/>
where, etc. this took place.  It's just a rumor in my book, but it <br/>
could be true.  *shrug*)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Are mountains which require a hike also places folks hide them. I<br/>
&gt; am an avid backpacker, Hiker and Mountain biker.<br/>
<br/>
You can hide them anywhere you think you can get away with it.  =)  <br/>
Most people do hide them in parks that require easy hikes, but many <br/>
of mine require arduous 10 mile hikes up a few thousand feet.  They <br/>
do get visitors on occasion, but they generally don't get visited <br/>
very often.  Some letterboxes are even 'hidden' indoors such as bars <br/>
or coffee shops where you have to ask the bartender or whoever to <br/>
pull out the box from behind the counter.  And there's currently a <br/>
letterbox hidden inside the Smithsonian.  The only limit is your <br/>
imagination.  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Also what about caves ? I am also an avid caver. <br/>
<br/>
I'm aware of at least two letterboxes that are hidden in caves, but <br/>
there might be more I'm not aware of.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; I noticed the clues on the ones I read were actually specific<br/>
&gt; directions to the box. Are cryptic clues, riddles etc. also<br/>
&gt; aloowed. You know something that requires so detective work ?<br/>
<br/>
You're right that most clues don't have a lot of 'imagination' to <br/>
them, but it's certainly not prohibited!  Part of the fun for me is <br/>
creating unique and entertaining clues which are anything but <br/>
specific directions to the box.  My Murder at Gabriel Park box <br/>
(http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/OR/GabrielPark) turns you <br/>
into a 'dectective' hunting for evidence to get a killer behind <br/>
bars.  My Where's Jack? letterbox <br/>
(http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/OR/WheresJack) requires <br/>
people to visit three different Jack in the Box restaurants counting <br/>
ceiling tiles, tables, hanging plants, lights, etc. before it leads <br/>
to the letterbox using that information.  The clue for the Around the <br/>
World in 80 Days letterbox <br/>
(http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/Mystery/AroundTheWorld) is <br/>
journal by Captain Cook which 'inadvertantly' tells the location of a <br/>
letterbox.  Lewis and Clark even looked for the box <br/>
(http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/Mystery/BuffaloWarrior), but <br/>
failed to find it.  ;o)  Other clues of mine include NASA putting out <br/>
a call for recruits <br/>
(http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/Mystery/EagleHasLanded) and <br/>
attacks by dinosaurs <br/>
(http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/Mystery/LandOfLongAgo).  Or <br/>
you can stop the Chipmunk of Terror <br/>
(http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/Mystery/ChipmunkOfTerror) <br/>
and put his days of terror to an end.<br/>
<br/>
Der Mad Stamper is famous for his particularly cryptic clues such as <br/>
Tryon Creek (http://members.aol.com/letterboxr/usa/tryon.htm), Pooch <br/>
Place (http://members.aol.com/letterboxr/usa/pooch.htm), PCC Rock <br/>
Creek (http://members.aol.com/letterboxr/usa/pccrc.htm), or the <br/>
Bronson Creek letterbox <br/>
(http://members.aol.com/letterboxr/usa/rebus_bc/rebus01.htm) in the <br/>
form of a rebus.<br/>
<br/>
The wonderful thing about letterboxing is that it's as varied as your <br/>
imagination can provide.  You can even use GPS's as part of the clue, <br/>
since there's not a rule prohibiting its use.  (However, many <br/>
letterboxes won't look for it since they may not have a GPS, but <br/>
there's not reason you can't do it.)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this answers all your questions!<br/>

Hey !! Now thats my kind. I have a geocache hidden in the Laurel Forks
area of Virginia. I hid it on a backpacking trip this summer. No one has
been to it. I suspect because it requires a 4 mile hike into the
mountains to it and then 4miles out. I love to plan backpacking , hiking
and mountain biking trips aiound finding them.<br/><br/>

Yes Ryan it does. Thank you very much. I didnt know if maybe since it had

                    <html><body>OK...  I know that it was a tad of an inconvenience having a white Christmas this year, but little did I know that my parents asked for the white Christmas!!!!
<br/>
<br/>Much to my surprise, my parents bought me a Craftsman snow blower for Christmas, and they just had to have snow so I could try it out!!!! Too bad that I only got about 3 inches in Manchester..... it would have worked out SO much better with 6-9 inches!!!!
<br/>
<br/>Sorry for the inconvenience!!!!!  Merry Christmas!

And here I thought that buying Amy the movie, "White Christmas" was <br/>
the only way we'd have one.  Who knew?<br/>
