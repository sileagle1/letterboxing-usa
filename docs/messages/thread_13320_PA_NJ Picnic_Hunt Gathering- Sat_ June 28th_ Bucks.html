boxers for the picnic! Ace has promised to bring his wife's brownies. <br/>
We'll also have John's 30th birthday cake and Ed's 2 1/2 alarm veggie <br/>
chili. The plan is to bring your own food (and a little extra if you <br/>
want to share.) No alcohol (Park Rules)<br/>
<br/>
A new box has been planted (there are 3 boxes at the site now), and a <br/>
stamp for the occasion has been carved. Also, many other boxes within <br/>
a few miles.<br/>
<br/>
Vital Statistics:<br/>
<br/>
Plan on arriving around 10:30 - 11 am. Someone will be there early to <br/>
set up the tables.<br/>
<br/>
Location is at the Moravian Pottery &amp; Tile Works, Route 313 (Swamp Rd)<br/>
Doylestown, PA. Park as near to the Pottery &amp; Tile Works as you can <br/>
and look for the LbNA sign in back where the the tables are. E-mail<br/>
D-man if you need more directions.<br/>
<br/>
If you can make it, drop us a line so we can make enough room for <br/>
everyone. Pray for sunshine!!<br/>

Yeah - count me in!<br/>
<br/>
This Sunday I was over a friends house playing an old 70's <br/>
wargame with a couple of buddys, when - without explanation - I <br/>
tossed them both into the car, saying:<br/>
<br/>
ME:<br/>
"Come on - there's something a few miles away, I gotta show <br/>
you."<br/>
<br/>
Driving away from the house I handed the Clue Sheet for "70 <br/>
Million Years Ago" to my friend in the backseat, asking: <br/>
<br/>
ME:<br/>
"Do me a favor - read me out the street directions for this."<br/>
<br/>
BUDDY1:<br/>
"Is this that stamp thingy that B**'s tellin' me you're doin'?"<br/>
<br/>
BUDDY2:<br/>
"Turn left up here.... What *is* this?  Dig!? Dig for what?!"<br/>
<br/>
ME: <br/>
*chuckle-chuckle*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say - 15 mins. later, both were cursing my name ...<br/>
<br/>
By this Monday, both had their stamps designed - and one <br/>
stamped his first logbook this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Expect a thunderstorm of Letterboxes to crop up around Philly <br/>
and South Jersey this summer.....<br/>
<br/>
Wheeeeee,<br/>

       I am one of the previously mentioned friends of Ace. Since <br/>
that trip I have returned to the "70 Million Years Ago" box and <br/>
stamped it myself. Unfortunately, Philadelphia seems to resemble <br/>
Seattle and I can't catch a break in the rain to go hunt some more.<br/>
I just may brave the rain and go find some today. Anyway, just <br/>
posting to say Hi.<br/>
