                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got back yesterday from a driving trip to New Orleans<br/>
and managed to do a little letterboxing along the way.  In<br/>
Baton Rouge I found the Old One and Geaux Tigers boxes on<br/>
New Years day, which was appropriate with LSU winning the <br/>
Sugar Bowl a few days later.  While in the New Orleans area<br/>
on 1/2/04, I found Cancer Corner alive and well, then headed <br/>
north across the lake to look for some of those boxes.  Abita<br/>
Springs was tough since the bridge was out but with a little<br/>
bushwhacking I managed to find it.  I then found Talisheek<br/>
Treasure Chest and Lock 2, but had no luck with Lock 1.<br/>
I rounded out the day with a visit to Fort Pike and found<br/>
the letterbox there, too.  I tried to find the Louisiana<br/>
Mystery box but I fear it is missing since I'm pretty sure<br/>
I was in the correct spot.  The clues are not on the web<br/>
site but I found them in an old Talklist Post.  <br/>
After a great time in "The City That Care Forgot", we drove <br/>
home via Hwy 90 through Cajun Country and enjoyed seeing that <br/>
part of Louisiana.  During the trip I also managed to place<br/>
4 boxes in Louisiana and 1 in Mississippi and have posted <br/>
the clues, so I hope they will be visited soon.  Thanks to<br/>
all placers of the boxes I found, it made the trip even<br/>
more fun.<br/>
