<br/>
my husband and I found this box today and it is in good condition.  However,<br/>
I just want to put out a little more information about the trail.  It is<br/>
relatively flat, but it is a natural trail.   My husband, who uses a<br/>
wheelchair could not have done this box with out helpers.  I had to leave<br/>
him at one point and go on by myself - which made me a little nervous.  We<br/>
encountered lots of roots and obstacles to our path like gullies, trees down<br/>
and large rocks.  If you have small children this is not a stroller friendly<br/>
path.  And at some points runs very close to the river.  I would be very<br/>
careful with children along this path.<br/>
<br/>
We decided to try this trail because the description said flat, narrow<br/>
trail.  Although this was generally true - it is a very rustic path and it<br/>
would have been helpful to know this in advance - since we would not have<br/>
attempted this box.  FYI -  There are some of us out there who want to<br/>
participate in this hobby, but use alternative modes of transport.  More<br/>
detailed information  about the accessibility of the trail would be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
