<br/>
http://www.myndworx.com/postal/AG/<br/>
<br/>
A few things to note..... As I am trying something new with this Postal Box, please, when you receive it, I ask that you not add anyone to the mailing list.  If you share it with someone in your local area, that is, of course, completely fine.  The reason that no one is to be added to the mailing list for the box is that I am going to try and track it so everyone has a chance to know where it is and when they can expect to get it.<br/>
<br/>
In view of that, the following address:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.myndworx.com/modules.php?name=PostalLB<br/>
<br/>
Will give a running account of where the letterbox has been, where it is and where it is going next.  This address does not require registration or joining anything to view it, anyone and everyone is welcomed to take a look and see the status of the letterbox on it's travels.<br/>
<br/>
So, with that in mind, I need to know if there is anyone who has signed up for the Aztec Gold Postal Letterbox that does NOT want their state reveled.  What I'm saying is that the map will indicate the state that the box is in and your trail name. Nothing else. No personal information, nothing traceable to you, zero. Just a star in the state that you reside in and your trail name.  If you have a problem with this, please contact me offlist at XrayvenhausX@Xmyndworx.comX and I'll put you in the 'Limbo State' (grin!)<br/>
<br/>
The Letterbox is hitting the postal service Monday, December 1st, 2003!  Closing date for addition to the list is Sunday, November 30th, 2003.<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank everyone that has signed up and that have offered words of support and encouragement. Thank you!!!<br/>
