Jackie and I with a couple of friends embarked on the MAINLINE trail to the <br/>
Massachusetts border today. It was a bit cool but we warmed up nicely as we <br/>
gained elevation. Thanks Drewclan for this beautiful hike. The couple that <br/>
came with us have now been exposed to Letterboxing at its best. They actually <br/>
had been on this trail before however it was VERY wet at the time with water <br/>
pouring down the brook at all sections on the way up to the border marker. I <br/>
guess it made for a tricky ascent/descent at times. Today it was dry as a <br/>
bone so we made good time. If it is wet however, you could add a minimum of <br/>
30 minutes to a full hour traversing the slippery rocks. Just a word of <br/>
caution.<br/>
