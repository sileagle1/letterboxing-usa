Clues:easy<br/>
Terrain:easy, 0.5 mile round trip<br/>
Location: Lisbon Meadows Park, on rt 169 in Lisbon; 0.2 mile south of <br/>
the junction of 169 and 138<br/>
<br/>
Ruth's Run<br/>
Ruth is our black lab.  This is her favorite park to go to, because <br/>
dogs are permitted off-leash.  Be aware that there are streams and <br/>
swamp-like areas.  If your dog is anything like ours, the only thing <br/>
better than water is mud!!<br/>
<br/>
Park in the southwest corner of the lot and enter at the trail <br/>
there.  Cross over the wooden footbridge, which was Scott Ostrowski's <br/>
Eagle Scout project(great job, Scott!).  Follow the path to the large <br/>
T intersection, and turn left toward the picnic pavilion.  Continue <br/>
down into and across the soccer field.  At the bleachers on the far <br/>
side of the field, take a compass heading of 320 degrees.  Follow the <br/>
path over the stream and into a meadow area.  Watch on your left for <br/>
a birdhouse on a low branch.  From the birdhouse, take a compass <br/>
reading of 15 degrees.  You will see a small groves of evergreens at <br/>
that heading, maybe 20 feet away.  Find Ruth's Run under rocks at the <br/>
base of one of the trunks.  Then let  your four-on-the-floor enjoy <br/>
all of the trails in the park!<br/>
<br/>
The cupcake letterboxes are also in this park.<br/>
