didn't get to go and box on Sunday, I was blessed with "finding" Saddam, Mao, <br/>
Osama and Hitler (via great friends Carolyn and the Pepe's!) and also was <br/>
able to obtain Pink Trotter's Personal Traveler!  <br/>
<br/>
On Monday, I ventured out (kind of late due to work) and found a really <br/>
"Corney" box, the DEP Nathan Hale, If Wishes Were Horses, and Indiana State <br/>
Stamp.  I would have gotten the state stamp at Holbrook on my way back, <br/>
however, I ran out of daylight!<br/>
<br/>
On Tuesday, I was blessed with more great weather and decided to go boxing <br/>
for four hours or so.  You've gotta love it when you can get out of work <br/>
early since the school kids went on a field trip!  I met up with Butterfly <br/>
and Angel and checked out the Brooksvale Park and Grinning Ninny boxes in <br/>
Hamden.  Ninny had extensive water damage to the logbook, so we replaced the <br/>
book.  I then left Butterfly and Angel to go biking, while I headed out to <br/>
the Giant to find Angel's Letterbox, Bear's Gift, The Chest, River Run, <br/>
Purple Flower, and Hobbomock's Cap.  I also found a very special bonus ;-)  A <br/>
Chestnut Leaf :-)   If I had known that I would get back to the car with <br/>
plenty of time, I would have ventured out to do the Chin.... Oh well!  I'll <br/>
be back!  <br/>
<br/>
I never thought I would hike the Giant.... however, in nice weather, I <br/>
actually enjoy it!  Thanks to all of you who have planted boxes up there!  <br/>
I'll probably get many of the other boxes next week after Memorial Day.<br/>
<br/>
Due to concerts and upcoming weather forcasts, I'm probably not going to get <br/>
out to box until at least Saturday or Sunday, which will be in the Burlingame <br/>
Area.  If anyone is going to be in Charlestown RI and want to go out and box, <br/>
let me know!<br/>
