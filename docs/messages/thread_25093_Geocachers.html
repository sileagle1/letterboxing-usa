I have had a letterbox planted in Campbell Valley Regional Park since 2004.  For 5 years it was quietly collecting other letterboxers' stamps and comments.

Please, please, please!!!!  Geocachers!  Educate yourselves about letterboxing!  Do not remove "anything" from letterboxes.<br/>

My children and I do both. Due to the fact that there are just more geocaches closer to us. I talk to them all the time about respecting the property that someone else worked on, so that we can enjoy this activity. So I am sorry for you.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, good luck with that...I put a series out in a city park here, but foolishly put box 1 near a 'cache.  Clues were WOM for a month, then posted...the day I posted them, I got a message from one of the locals who had the WOM clues that the first stamp was gone (along with the fancy-schmancy decorated container I had made for it), traded out by a cacher.  She actually tracked down the cache for me online :-)  and I emailed every single person who logged finding said cache during that month.  I got loads of replys back, saying "nope, not me" but the person who took the stamp remains at large.  I did have a couple folks tell me they did find my LB with the stamp intact, so the window has narrowed, but I still need to cross-reference replies rec'd against the cache log, and also the LB log.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I don't think I'll get the stamp back; I've recarved and replaced, moving the LB to a (hopefully) safer location.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, some of the folks who wrote said they never "trade trinkets" and just log their visit in the book.  I sent them info/links about letterboxing...maybe I'll make a convert!<br/>
