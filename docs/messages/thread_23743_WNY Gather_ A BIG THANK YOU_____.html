who made our trip to WNY so enjoyable.  For those who don't know, I <br/>
spent 3 1/2 years in Western New York (even student taught at <br/>
Williamsville East HS), so it was nice to be back!  It brought back so <br/>
many nice memories!  Bluebird grew up in Kenmore, so she too was "back <br/>
home."<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all of your hard work!  We ended up with well over 100 <br/>
stamps, not including hitchhikers, personal travelers, cooties, etc!  <br/>
I'm bummed though, since I didn't get stamps Green Star Quinn, <br/>
Sunnygirl, Hazel Horse, and IAP... even after sitting and talking with <br/>
them for quite some time!  If any of you would like to exchange (I <br/>
think you guys all have my stamp..... but I don't have yours....), let <br/>
me know!<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had time to go to Letchworth SP (ended up not going due to the <br/>
pouring rain), and to Buffalo for Anchor Bar wings... perhaps I can <br/>
make a week of it next year and get to all of those great places that I <br/>
missed this year!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for a great weekend!<br/>
