There is trouble in paradise. I hesitate to bring this up lest it <br/>
lead to both parties being flamed. And yet...<br/>
<br/>
Okay, here is the issue. JugglerMouse wants to also include Cheese <br/>
Racing at the October 4th event in SLO, CA <br/>
http://webpages.charter.net/astroweaver/letterboxing/meadow.html <br/>
<br/>
Now, I must tell you that JugglerMouse is a fine letterboxer, great <br/>
carver and a terrific gal (cute, too.) However, I must protest that <br/>
this mania for Cheese Racing has taken over enough lives already. <br/>
<br/>
Please help me out. I have created a poll up in the poll section for <br/>
you to vote. Let JugglerMouse and me know whether or not you think <br/>
that Cheese Racing should or should not be included in letterboxing <br/>
events. I just hope that there are enough concerned parents out there <br/>
who feel as I do. But I do not wish to influence you in anyway.<br/>

Why yes!  Most assuredly, cheese racing is an under appreciated art form that should be allowed the freedom of expression that competitive under-water basket weaving and blind-folded fly tying enjoy!  And let us not forget the oppression that, up until recently, competitive high-speed wool gathering suffered from, oh No!<br/>
<br/>
I say, if cheese racing is hidden and made to feel 'dirty' then two things will happen.... The children will sneak behind the gym wall and do it until all hours of the night and even twice on weekends and we ALL know where that leads us to!  Yes, I'll say it, teenage cottage cheese abuse. There. I said it, by god someone has to face the truth. And last but not least, if Cheese Racing is outlawed, then only Minor Town Officials will have cheese!<br/>

What?  I'm hurt.  You go to the time to mention the importance of underwater<br/>

That's it!  I'm thinking about leaving the list! :-) :p<br/>
