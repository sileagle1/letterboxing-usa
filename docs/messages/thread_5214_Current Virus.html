We got this one at work and I saw y'all talking about it here. It manifests itself under many different names.  Be careful about opening emails with attachments!  More important with this one, be careful about previewing emails with attachments if you have Outlook Express (like we do at work) -- apparently the attachment can load when previewing the message even if you don't download it.  Turn off your preview option and delete anything with attachments regardless who sent it unless you know specifically its coming! This virus is a "mass-mailing routine" and randomly emails people from your address book who then can re-infect you! Its my first and hopefully last experience with a worm, so I'm no expert.  I'm just passing on what I learned.  See the link below for more information about this virus and what names it assumes.  There are about 40.<br/>
