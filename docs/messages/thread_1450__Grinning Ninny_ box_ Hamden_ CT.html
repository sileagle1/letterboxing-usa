image, a face with big round eyes and a big toothy grin.<br/>
Difficulty: medium, mostly on trails, round trip from parking area is <br/>
1.3 miles.<br/>
Location:Brooksvale Recreation Park, Hamden, CT. The park is on the <br/>
West side of Brooksvale Avenue. Enter the driveway with the sign that <br/>
says "Veteran's Memorial Building". Drive all the way to the end, and <br/>
park in the small parking lot. Before (or after) going to find the <br/>
box, you may want to visit the geese at the pond just East of the <br/>
parking lot. To the East of the pond, there are sheep, goats, etc. in <br/>
fenced in areas (goats! awesome!). On the South side of the red barn, <br/>
weather permitting, ther may be rabbits on display (rabbits! Way <br/>
cool!).<br/>
    But the real action is in the forest to the West. From the North <br/>
end of the pond, go West through the open area to the hilltop. Follow <br/>
the trail North-West. It runs roughly parallel to a small stream. <br/>
Whenever you get to a junction, keep to the left to stay near the <br/>
stream. When you have gone about 1/4 mile, the trail crosses the <br/>
stream. You climb a long hill (going South-West), and on reaching the <br/>
top, another trail cuts accross. Turn right (North-West). (Turning <br/>
left is a short cut back to the parking lot.) Walk down the gentle <br/>
slope to the place where you cross the stream again (yes, the same <br/>
stream). It may be dried up, but you will recognize it by the <br/>
decrepit concrete pipe cutting across the trail. Where the trail <br/>
curves toward the South-West, cut into the woods and go due North <br/>
(magnetic) some 200 feet or less to a stone wall. When you get to the <br/>
West end (where it turns right), continue at 293 degrees up the <br/>
hillside to where two stone walls form a corner. There is a gap in <br/>
the wall just North of the corner. About 19 feet from the corner, <br/>
direction; 313 degrees, there is a tree about 8 inches in diameter. <br/>
The box is under a rock about 5 feet before the tree. This rock <br/>
sticks up about 3 inches higher than those surrounding it. Remove the <br/>
smaller rocks from it's South-West side to expose the Grinning Ninny <br/>
box.<br/>
    You should have no trouble finding your way back to your car from <br/>
there. And, you may as well go straight back because this forest is <br/>
so uninteresting, except for Brooksvale Stream, 1/3 mile to the North-<br/>
West.<br/>
