sharing some personal information. She likes to meet other <br/>
letterboxers and she likes to talk about letterboxing, and she does <br/>
have a lot of time to pursue the hobby, but she also has a certain <br/>
philosophy about life that most "normal" people can't or won't ever <br/>
share.<br/>
<br/>
In this wonderfully diverse world, some people need some extra slack <br/>
when it comes to others understanding them. Wanda is one of those. I'm <br/>
not knocking myself out trying to figure her as either a simple soul <br/>
living in a complex world, or a complex soul living a simple <br/>
life...she's just Wanda.<br/>
<br/>
And she's not the only person in letterboxing that could leave you <br/>
scratching your head, we have a lot of unique friends here.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

&gt; OK, so one minute Wanda says letterboxing isn't supposed to be <br/>
competetive <br/>
&gt; and the numbers really don't matter.  Then the next minute she <br/>
writes in <br/>
&gt; just to say that she found her 1058th box. Who in the world has that <br/>
much <br/>
&gt; time on their hands?? Also she carries around a little list of boxes <br/>
she's <br/>
&gt; found.  I've only found a few boxes so far, but she is always one of <br/>
the few <br/>
&gt; people who writes in their count.  So make your mind!!!  Isn't this <br/>
just <br/>
&gt; supposed to be a fun hobby?  So why the big deal about numbers?  I <br/>
guess I <br/>
&gt; haven't been around long enough to "get it"<br/>
