                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry to hear that this one is missing.  I looked for it a couple of <br/>
weekends ago, but lacked Matt's sister's certainty that I was in the <br/>
right place.  I didn't have time to check the other ones there.  Are <br/>
they okay?  Now I know that you're replacing one, maybe I'll wait to <br/>
go check for the other two until I see you've posted the replacement.<br/>
    I thought of a great one and my son carved me a stamp last <br/>
night.  Look for cars-on-a-stick coming soon.  It will end up about <br/>
half way between Matt's Chicago Portage and my Architectural Mystery <br/>
boxes so it should be popular.  <br/>
