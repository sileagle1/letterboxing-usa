Canada and all I have to say is WowWWWWWWW!  The scenery was <br/>
FANTASTIC!  I'm going to try and temporarily put some pics online so <br/>
you can see them.  I'll let you know when I'm successful!<br/>
<br/>
I found one box in Vermont while on my way: Graveyard (sniff sniff.... <br/>
my favorite gravestone was in that cemetery..... sniff sniff).  <br/>
<br/>
I attempted a box in Mont Tremblant, which was unfortunately missing.  <br/>
I also attempted two boxes in Quebec CIty, one of which was long gone, <br/>
but I found out after I came back that the other was there (sniff <br/>
Sniff..... two words..... ROAD TRIP!).  I did find Quebec's Stairs <br/>
with a View, which was a great hide!<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait to go back!  Perhaps I'll get back in September for a <br/>
weekend!  (to try for that all important box that I couldn't find!)<br/>
