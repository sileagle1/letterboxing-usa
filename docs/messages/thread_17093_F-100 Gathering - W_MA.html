F100 gathering at Stanly Park in Westfield. Yes, some of us didn't <br/>
check our emails at 6AM and headed out only to learn once we got <br/>
there it was cancelled:) !!! Was so good to see and talk to Pine <br/>
Tree and Columbian Bugs and to do a few boxes together.  <br/>
I personally had a GREAT time... I finally got to meet WANDA and <br/>
PETE together and I  especially enjoyed the look on Tehutika and <br/>
Annetka's faces when we ALL showed up at their front door!  ..Truely <br/>
they were "surprised" to see us all?? Phynstar kept me in stitches <br/>
all afternoon as she accompanied me to my 200th BOX.  <br/>
(personal "yipee!!" here) And Team Green Dragon.. well what can I <br/>
say except, thanks for the "lesson" in clue deciphering skills, I <br/>
learned alot from you. ...(and, YES, I still feel guilty)  you guys <br/>
are the BEST . <br/>
I think you've got me hooked because suddenly I'm hot on the <br/>
trail of several of "those" boxes. Can't wait to get out there next <br/>
weekend.   I'm looking forward to the REAL f-100 gathering whenever <br/>
it does happen.   CHEERS;)     "kstar"<br/>
