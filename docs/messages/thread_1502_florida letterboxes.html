                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, in the spirit of the times- here is the recount of the Florida <br/>
letterboxes. Mind you there will be no late submissions accepted here <br/>
by the Florida Secretary of Letterboxes (that's me elected by a <br/>
unanimous vote of Florida Letterboxers - 1 to 0). There are currently <br/>
two boxes in the Titusville area (unless they have recently gone <br/>
missing). The ones in the Canaveral Marsh and the Blackpoint Wildlife <br/>
Drive are valid and as far as I know and do not have any dimples or <br/>
hanging chads. The squirrelfish box was previously vandalized in <br/>
clear attempt by the throw the numbers off by some unknown nefarious <br/>
party (thought to be the ALFP - Anti Letterboxing Florida Party).<br/>
<br/>
There is a chance I may be able to replace that one this week. There <br/>
is also a good chance that I may place one in Sarasota over the <br/>
Thanksgiving weekend. If so, I will overrule myself and add them to <br/>
the count and send the clues to the list ASAP. I have also heard <br/>
rumors a certain Amy is threatening to break my exclusive collection <br/>
of Florida Letterboxes by adding one or more during an upcoming trip. <br/>
I hope so, I have waited a very long time for someone else to plant <br/>
some down here for me to find!<br/>
