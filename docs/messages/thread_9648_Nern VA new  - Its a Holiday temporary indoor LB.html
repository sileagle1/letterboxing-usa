temporary for the holidays.  My Webmaster, Knights of Columbo, will <br/>
post in on my website (please) and those snowed in frustrated local <br/>
letterboxers will no doubt find it.<br/>

It's a Holiday<br/>
Placed by Scarab of the Doubtful Guests<br/>
December 13, 2002<br/>
Arlington County<br/>
Arlington, Virginia<br/>
Hand made stamp<br/>
Easy, indoors &amp; probably temporary<br/>
<br/>
Twas the nightmare before Christmas<br/>
And all through the mall<br/>
Anxious shoppers were rushing <br/>
Praying Pentagon City had it all.<br/>
I arrived by the Metro<br/>
And went straight to the top<br/>
To consult with the Wizard<br/>
And visit his shop.<br/>
Puzzling place.  Puzzling Wizard.<br/>
"Which it's the number of brown tiles between our doorway you wants."<br/>
"For what, want for what?"<br/>
"Only Santy Claws and that Scarab fellow know and neither one of <br/>
them is telling me.  <br/>
Go ask that Joseph at the bank around the corner.  <br/>
That's the place to look if he deposited somethin' int it?"<br/>
Joseph, I discovered, was full of hang ups.<br/>
"I haven't a clue," he answered to my enquiries,<br/>
"but you remind me of that puzzling fellow I saw the other day.<br/>
He walked away from our window around the curve of the balcony <br/>
counting the small potted trees.<br/>
Did it several times like he was trying to be sure of something. <br/>
I don't know how long those trees have been there myself, <br/>
Nor how long they'll stay."<br/>
One, two, three ...  Finally I sat in a long white bench with a fine <br/>
view.<br/>
Behind me immediately over my right shoulder was a mall map.<br/>
Across the wide atrium from me the glass elevator rose and fell.<br/>
Almost directly below me I gazed down the tree at Santa on his <br/>
golden chair.<br/>
"Wow, a natural Santa."<br/>
"What's an unnatural Santa, Dad?"<br/>
I pushed the bench towards that potted tree on my right, <br/>
Made like I was looking at something in my hands,<br/>
And surreptitiously reached under the faux grey moss.<br/>
"May I help you?" asked the guard suspiciously.<br/>
"OH, um, I thought I lost my keys" I said while holding the black, <br/>
dual film cannisters in one hand,  <br/>
"Wait, here they are in my other pocket."<br/>
"Alright then, happy holidays to you."<br/>
"And to you."  Whew.<br/>
I spent a pleasant time recording in the scroll and enjoying the <br/>
expansive view.<br/>
Then I went all the way around and all the way down to celebrate in <br/>
the food court.<br/>
Merry letterboxing to all, and to all a good hike.<br/>
<br/>
Please be discreet.  Please do not root around in a lot of tree's <br/>
moss if you're not sure.  It is very likely I will remove this dual <br/>
black film cannister letterbox after the holidays.  I will note so <br/>
here before I do.  If you find this letterbox missing or damaged or <br/>
are puzzled about the clues write theDoubtfulGuests@yahoo.com.<br/>
