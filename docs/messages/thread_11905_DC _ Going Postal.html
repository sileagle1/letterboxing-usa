     Princess Turtle, Firefly and I had a great time yesterday hunting 15 <br/>
boxes. I am happy to announce PT and I reached our 100th find at Tea Tortl, <br/>
#1 box of The Greenbelt Animals, placed by the mobots. I highly recommend <br/>
visiting this park. Who would have thought there was something this lovely <br/>
growing in Greenbelt?<br/>
     After nabbing those 3 stamps we scooched on over to Rock Creek Park to <br/>
get Squirrels 2 boxes. We had a half hour to get to the National Postal <br/>
Museum, for the Exploratory Post Event. Firefly says, "I can get us there, <br/>
no problem." First day w/o rain, two marches going on, streets blocked, <br/>
police everywhere and naturally the roads we wanted to take were blocked. <br/>
Just your typical day in DC. And yes, again, I took a left turn in a no left <br/>
turn. OH YEAH! Don't we just love our nations capital!<br/>
     Got there after Tim Brookes speech. I really wanted to hear what he had <br/>
to say, but was fortunate to do a meet/great with him. I just love his <br/>
accent! He was very chipper and has a great smile. I think Appledumpling <br/>
Gang broke him in to the craziness of the mid-atlantic group. I wonder if he <br/>
discovered their bonus box planted after the 7 allowed boxes that were <br/>
planted by the Smithsonian?<br/>
     ADG, Firefly, Strick (thanks for the exchange, finally. And helping <br/>
this old girl off the marble wall), Princess Turtle and I headed for the <br/>
Taft Memorial box. Walking DC isn't much better than driving! Firefly <br/>
remarked, "I know it's near the bell tower". One big loop to find it not too <br/>
far from the Postal Museum. Hurrah!!!<br/>
     I have to mention I met a very nice young man, named Satya, at the <br/>
Postal Event. New to DC, not knowing anyone, he was experiencing his first <br/>
finds. We did an exchange of stamps and I hope, if he finds this hobby to <br/>
his liking, that we meet on the trail again or at the VA spring event.<br/>
     Thanks to all who made this such a wonderful day!<br/>
     Psychomommy and Princess Turtle<br/>

crawlies are coming out of hibernation)<br/>
