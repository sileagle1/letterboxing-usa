The Davie Co. letterboxers stamped up at this box last Dec. We became <br/>
confused but were very fortunate to finally get on the right course before <br/>
darkness caught us. The box was intact and the stamp is great. A couple of <br/>
hints: Find the swimming pool off Benjamin Parkway. It's actually across <br/>
from Grimsley H.S. And also don't become confused by the street named <br/>
Mimosa. After that it's actually very simple. Good luck and good hunting!<br/>
