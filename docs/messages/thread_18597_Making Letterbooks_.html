I've been looking for an article on the steps for making letterbooks <br/>
so they hold up and work.  Does anyone have one you can point me to?<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">  Diane and I found great wooden boxes in Michael's that are shaped like books.  They have enough room for logbook, stamp and ink of reasonable size - say, 4x5 inches inside.  They aren't big enough for a hitchhiker, though.  I just couldn't bring myself to tear up a real book.  I read some geeky stuff, and I could just see someone saying "Fox-Davies' Complete Guide to Heraldry?  What trash!  Let's tear it up for a letterbook!".  Eep!  One man's trash...<br/>
  Failing that, almost any book may do.  Diane glued some cloth to the 'binding' and 'cover', and I made up on paper something that looks like a title frontpiece and spine to glue on.  I painted the edges red, like on older books.  Could be any color, really.<br/>
  Kate did a clever letterbook in Inquiring Minds, Rhode Island, Kent County, putting a video box in the reference area and giving it a number.  I've got my N.E.S.S. series in Rhode Island, Newport County.  There's supposed to be a very good one in Vermont, too.  Must get there...<br/>

<br/>
This is by far the simplest method for hollowing out a book.<br/>
http://www.lisavollrath.com/articles/010.html<br/>
<br/>
Though I would add that if you have a power drill, and don't glue the <br/>
block of pages to the back cover,  you can drill through the pages at <br/>
each corner of the niche once the edges are glued,  and use that as a <br/>
starting/stopping point for the X-acto blade-- it makes cutting alot <br/>
easier.<br/>
<br/>
