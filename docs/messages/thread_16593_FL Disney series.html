                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, some of you may remember that I inadvertently "stole" the stamp from <br/>
the Celebration letterbox back in August.  I sent it to another letterboxer, who <br/>
lives closer to Orlando than I do, hoping she'd have a chance to put it back <br/>
before I could get there.  Unfortunately, it appears she hasn't had a chance <br/>
to do it yet.  I was back in Orlando for a karate tournament this weekend, and <br/>
checked on the box.  It was stampless.<br/>
<br/>
So I got a stamp for it--not exactly like the original, but in the same <br/>
category, and better than nothing for those who find the box.<br/>
<br/>
And Kat--  If you still have that original stamp, when you get the chance to <br/>
replace it, just take the one I put in there out, so the box will be in <br/>
original condition again.  And if anyone's going after this box, the logbook is very <br/>
full.  People are stamping on the backs of the sheets, working their way back <br/>
through the book.  I didn't have a spare one to replace it with.<br/>
<br/>
And in other news, we tried to find the box at the Wilderness Lodge, only we <br/>
didn't find it.  We're 99.9 percent sure we found the right stump, but there <br/>
was no letterbox inside it.  :-(  If anyone's found it recently, I'd love to <br/>
know about it!<br/>
<br/>
Then we ran out of time (had to be back at the tournament) so we weren't able <br/>
to try for any more boxes.<br/>

The last time someone emailed a verification on the Wilderness <br/>
Letterbox, was on 9-29-03.<br/>
If anyone is planning on doing any of my 3 Disney boxes in the near <br/>
future, I will gladly send them new logbooks to replace my full ones, <br/>
as I live in CT. Just email me off line at haalck@snet.net. <br/>
Thanks, Bill &amp; Craig <br/>
