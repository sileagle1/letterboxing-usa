My family and I are leaving for Spring Break in a week, are there any easy<br/>
boxes along I-5?  We are leaving from Vancouver, WA towards San Francisco<br/>
and them on to Disneyland.  I will not have time for hours of boxing and my<br/>
husband has never got to experience the love of Letterboxing yet.  Since<br/>
time will be short I was hoping for a few quick finds along the way.  Any<br/>
help would be greatly appreciated.  Willow.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are a handful of short boxes around the Grants Pass, OR area--<br/>
although some require some extended 'off interstate' driving (like 8 <br/>
miles off I-5 to reach the trail head sort of thing).<br/>
<br/>
Others you might try, include:<br/>
<br/>
B*utte Valley Airport<br/>
Pax<br/>
Tip of Shasta<br/>
Source of the Sacramento (not sure about snow condition for this one <br/>
at the moment)<br/>
H*edge Creek Falls<br/>
Shasta Shade<br/>
Craggy Castle<br/>
P*ackers Bay<br/>
Dammed Shasta<br/>
Queen City Shasta<br/>
FunHog Lake Plateau<br/>
I*de Adobe<br/>
Wild Goose<br/>
<br/>
8 of these are ones that we placed and are fairly quick, drive bys <br/>
in a sense (at least, that's the reputation we've got for them)--<br/>
some include up to 1-1/2 mile jaunts.  Some of the others on this <br/>
list we haven't yet found--just know they're fairly close to I-5 <br/>
along your planned route--so I can't vouch for how long they'll take <br/>
to find.  There are a bunch more down near the Sacramento area but <br/>
I'm not sure which route you're taking to Anaheim from that point--<br/>
some folks like to cut over West toward San Francisco to avoid <br/>
Sacramento/Davis area traffic, others even continue further West <br/>
toward the City by the Bay because they LOVE Bay Area traffic, <br/>
too. ;)  It all depends what your personal traffic tolerance <br/>
quotient is the day of your adventure.  Further South, beyond the <br/>
Monterey area, I've got no clue as we haven't been down there since <br/>
we started letterboxing a couple of years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Another great box along the way is the Shakespeare LB Series in <br/>
Ashland, OR--although it isn't necessarily considered a drive by--<br/>
it's just a great letterbox with awesome clues!  Of course, there's <br/>
always the infamous &amp; sadistic Ryan's LB at the Applegate Rest Area <br/>
somewhere around the Grants Pass, OR area.  ;)  However, don't get <br/>
too upset if it takes you 2, 3, 4 or even 50 different attempts <br/>
before you find it.  You wouldn't be its first victim.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your trip!!!  Nothing like hanging out with Mickey during <br/>
Spring Break!<br/>
