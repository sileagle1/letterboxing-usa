<p>Could someone please tell me if it is possible to scan incoming mail (not attachments)on the Yahoo Mail site (i.e., mail not forwarded from Yahoo to OE, Eudora, etc. using optional services)? I am running XP with Norton System Works 2002.05. I could not find a means to scan Yahoo Mail through Yahoo or Norton without purchasing premium services from Yahoo that allow forwarding to an email client that Norton automatically scans.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm not certain what you're asking, Linda.  (I 
was probably out in the sun too long today. *grin*)  Here are a couple of 
answers, but I may be waaaaay off the mark, so please speak up if this doesn't 
tell you what you need to know.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you're visiting the Yahoo!Groups website and 
reading the posts there--as many people do since Yahoo seems to have tangled 
software merging Clubs and Groups (don't get me started again on this one! 
*rueful chuckle*)--then your regular virus-checker should snag anything you 
unwittingly encounter and try to run (whether you intended to or not) at the 
website.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you're reading your emails through any service, 
Yahoo or Hotmail or even Outlook Express, your virus checker and/or mail service 
should be stopping anything viral before you open it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Nevertheless, it's wise to remain alert to viruses, 
and keep your virus-checker updated.  And don't open email attachments--in 
your mail or at a website--unless you're absolutely, positively certain that 
they're safe.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>And, while I'm writing, Eliza, if you and/or Ruth 
go into lurk mode, I'll pout. *pretends to pout, but had too good a time 
letterboxing today to pout effectively*  There are just certain 
subjects that people--me included--get a bit prickly about.   Everyone 
has an opinion, and dashing out the door to go letterboxing, I don't always take 
the time to phrase things as thoughtfully as I might.  If I offended you, 
I'm so sorry! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>And Eliza, did I miss it, or haven't you shared 
your brillllliant virtual letterbox idea with the list yet...?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Meanwhile, I did plant another box today, but I'll 
put that into another email so it doesn't get buried (so to speak *grin*) 
in this post. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cheerfully,</div>
<div>Ais</div></body></html>

</p><p>Thanks for your thoughful reply. 
</p><p>I do read my LBNA posts in Yahoo Mail. I should have clarified that. But, I had an epiphany (this is why I work ON a computer but not IN the computer field) and contacted Tech Support at Symantec (Norton). I learned that at least Norton Anti-virus does not scan Yahoo Mail where messages are stored on Yahoo's servers..only POP e-mail clients such as Outlook Express, Eudora, etc., where messages are downloaded from server to hard drive. You are right when you say that reading posts from the Group board may be the best way to avoid a virus.
</p><p>I am not trying to belabor this, but if anyone out there has more insight or better understanding than me, please share. 
</p><p>Glad you had an enchanting day letterboxing. Look forward to reading about your latest. I explored some interesting Central Connecticut areas yesterday in preparation for placing my first letterboxes. This weekend was perfect for anything to do with this wonderful activity! 
</p><p>Linda/Ms. Alafair

<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for the additional info, Linda, so now I 
think I can answer your question:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Yahoo Mail automatically scans for viruses, so you 
are as okay as their virus checker is effective.  In other words, don't 
open attachments unless you're comfortable with them, but you should be fairly 
safe from the most common, recognized viruses.  That said, nobody is 100% 
safe from all viruses.  That's the game the virus-creators play: Finding 
ways around existing virus-protection efforts.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>At Yahoo Mail's website, it says, 
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="675">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="2"><b></b></td></tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>
<div>This feature offers Yahoo! Mail 
      users a fast, free and effective anti-virus tool to protect them from 
      known viruses sent and received via e-mail file attachments. Virus scan is 
      seamlessly integrated into Yahoo! Mail, and automatically scans all 
      outgoing e-mail file attachments such as documents, spreadsheets, zip 
      files, presentations and executable files. People can also choose to scan 
      incoming e-mail file attachments."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That copied strangely and I'm not 
      sure it'll go through in this email... if you can't read it, more 
      about this is at </div>
