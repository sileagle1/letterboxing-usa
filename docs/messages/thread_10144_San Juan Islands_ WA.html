<div>Just got back from three days in the San Juans!  They 
are numerous beautiful islands in Washington, a great place to visit!  Even 
though I was there on business, took time to check out the boxes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Caught the afternoon ferry Monday and stopped at Lopez 
Island.  Went down to Agate Beach to search for the 7Nails two boxes.  
Got to Agate Beach in time to watch the gorgeous sunset.  A very clear 
evening, a very colorful sunset as the sun sank behind Vancouver Island.  
Searched for the boxes, "I am sure I was in the right place" (where have you 
heard that before???) possibly.  It was too dark by then to safely reach 
under logs and behind trees, so postponed (aka gave up) the search for another 
day.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On San Juan found the box at English Camp in good 
condition.  Beautiful views of Garrison Bay, the box was under a great log 
to sit on and log in and enjoy the view.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Headed down to Lime Kiln State Park and the Whale 
Watch.  Saw another beautiful sunset from the Whale Watch.  Found the 
letterbox in great condition, in a great location.  Sat on the bench to log 
in and watch the ships go by and watch the remnants of the sunset.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you are ever in the area, a trip to the San Juans would 
be a very scenic addition to your visit!</div>
