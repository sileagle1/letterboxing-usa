Wow!  You got nearly all my boxes!  You only missed Peace on Earth.  <br/>
I did post a warning about Tangled Woods:<br/>

Subject:  FYI - Tangled Woods, MA<br/>
<br/>
Just a note to alert you to some *major* road construction going on <br/>
at the location of The Tangled Woods Letterbox in MA. If you are <br/>
thinking of searching for it, please delay by about a month. I will <br/>
let you know when it is all clear again.<br/>

I am, fortunately, in a unique position to keep an eye out on that <br/>
one.  Hope you had fun!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">TeamGreenDragon had a great ( although wet ) weekend of boxing and <br/>
found<br/>
the following boxes all in good shape : ) . " A Bridge in the Woods " <br/>
in<br/>
Wayland , " Heron on the Charles River " in Watertown ( our second <br/>
attempt<br/>
at this one ) , " Nauset Light " in Eastham " ( The waves where really<br/>
kicking up out here !! )  , " Wizard of the Waves " in <br/>
Wellfleet , "Cooks<br/>
Tour " also in Wellfleet , " Chatham Light " in Chatham ( It was <br/>
great to<br/>
see some familiar names and unfamiliar Sig stamps in some of these <br/>
Cape Cod<br/>
boxes , " FunHog " , " Amanda from Seattle " and " The Doubtful <br/>
Guests "<br/>
amongst others ) , " Chatham Rooster 2 " again in Chatham , " Oyster -<br/>
Ville - Joshua Pond " and the " Oyster Pearl " both in Osterville and<br/>
finally  " Sagamore Hill "  !! ( We had to take shelter in the Ammo <br/>
Bunkers<br/>
to stamp in it was raining so hard ! )   :  )<br/>
<br/>
The snow may keep us from finding, but the rain won't stop us from <br/>
looking<br/>
!<br/>
<br/>
We also completed our part in CSCM's mission to get a box in all 39 <br/>
cities<br/>
and towns in RI by placing " Dexter " in North Providence !<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank everyone for getting us up and out to see these great<br/>
locations.<br/>
