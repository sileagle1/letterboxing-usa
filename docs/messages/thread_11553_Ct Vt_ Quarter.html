noted that the degrees on the compass did not line up. I figured the <br/>
degree needed was 20 degrees. Pink trotters checked it and came up <br/>
with the same.  Anyway since there is ony one wall up there it is not <br/>
to hard to figure out . <br/>
    When we found it WOW! the carving was great!!! We just loved it <br/>
and can't wait to pick up a few more quarters. <br/>
   You can go back now as I had carved a stamp for that area over the <br/>
winter and planted Rock Climber yesterday.  I'll post it next.   The <br/>
day was perfect not only did Pink Trotters get her HH but when we <br/>
came out of the trail  we were able to exchange with  Cootie and Kyle <br/>
who were there in the car with the Plane Spotter box. Avery good day <br/>
for leader of the Pack, Pink Trotters and Cowboy and Cody. <br/>
