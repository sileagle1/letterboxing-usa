letterboxing activity (it falls under our natural resources project) <br/>
with our photography and goat packing projects. I'm the adult leader <br/>
for the club and the three afore mentioned projects and I'm looking <br/>
forward to sharing ideas and gleaning experience and information from <br/>
you all for our newbie group. I'd like to see 4-H make this a <br/>
legitimized activity for all 4-H'ers across the U.S. within the <br/>
natural resources or orienteering project fields complete with project <br/>
standards to go by and display entries at the fair levels. Our club <br/>
will be placing it's first box in the Mount Nutt Wilderness Area of <br/>
Arizona this weekend (weather permitting). The young member that <br/>
places it will be posting clues at the letterboxing usa site. Is <br/>
he/she supposed to do that here, too? Thanks again!<br/>
