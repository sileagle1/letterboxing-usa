It is at beautiful Hop Brook Lake, you might want to check out the <br/>
website during the spring and summer to see what this park offers. <br/>
This is a wonderful place to spend a day with the family or just <br/>
alone. Swimming and fishing are allowed. This park also happens to be <br/>
pooch friendly, so long as they are leashed. I have learned that <br/>
there is now a fee to enter the park from April 19 to Labor Day (1.00 <br/>
for each person on foot or 3.00 per car). So keep that in mind when <br/>
you go. However this box is accessible quite easily by foot even when <br/>
the park is closed. <br/>

This is a quick easy hike for all.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you, Aaron had a birthday <br/>
but the stamp's here for you!!<br/>
This box was placed to commemorate Aaron's birthday. The current <br/>
stamp will be retired on February 7, of next year and replaced with a <br/>
new one. This is an easy hike, it's actually more of a drive by. <br/>
However, it begins the Presidential series so look for those clues <br/>
before you head out.<br/>
<br/>
You can either park at the first lot and walk or park at the first <br/>
lot to your left. In any case you will be heading on the Wetlands <br/>
Trail. From the gate take 24 paces on the left right count. To your <br/>
left will be a fallen log. On the east side of the fallen log( or the <br/>
left for you compassly challenged, like me) hidden in the wall is the <br/>
SURPRISE you are seeking.<br/>
