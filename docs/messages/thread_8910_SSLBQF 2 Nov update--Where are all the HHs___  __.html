                    <div class="plaintext-content">     Just went out to finally look for a few more boxes that <br/>
remained after the South Sound LB Quest Fest last Saturday (since I <br/>
dawdled along on Saturday in a half slumbered state--I think I only <br/>
found 5 that day) and am sad to report (although my parents will be <br/>
quite happy to know that I followed their better parental judgement) <br/>
that I did not pick up ANY hitchhikers from the area around the <br/>
Insane Asylum or the rest of the park, for that matter.  It seems <br/>
they all already got rides from other unwitting people prior to my <br/>
visit and are running about the NW ready to infect others active in <br/>
the sport.  <br/>
     Besides accidently catching Fudrick's 'HH Letterbox Fever' 2 <br/>
days before the event as I noticed it in plain view along a trail, I <br/>
honestly did not pick up any others...  :(   But, it is quite <br/>
fitting that I caught that one because I still do have quite a case <br/>
of LB Fever.<br/>
     Today, I found the Secret Gardeners' &amp; Canada Goose's four <br/>
clowns--what extraordinary stamps and cute little log books, to <br/>
boot!  I also found Fudrick's 3 boxes--his clues were really <br/>
ingenious and such sweet little stories describing neat little <br/>
anecdotes with such nice stamps.  I, too, am an Aunt Beth(any) but I <br/>
don't think I'd ever be considered quite as nice as the real Aunt <br/>
Beth in the clues.  How sweet she seemed and fitting that she had <br/>
such great neighbors to spare her from such a miserable situation in <br/>
life!!!  Amanda's Fledgeling box was absolutely adorable!  And it <br/>
was only fitting that I finished the day at DZ &amp; SunSeeker's Finish <br/>
Line!  How true, how true and what an awesome hiding spot and neat <br/>
little stamp, too!   <br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone enjoyed the event and I look forward to meeting you <br/>
along future trails...<br/>
