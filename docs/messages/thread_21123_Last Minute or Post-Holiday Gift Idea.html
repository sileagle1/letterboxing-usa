I was at Prizm Art Supplies yesterday, picking up some last minute <br/>
gifts when I spotted the ultimate carving lamp. It was actually <br/>
called the "Ultimate Lamp" or something to that effect. It has a <br/>
lamp, on an adjustable arm that has a daylight bulb in it. There's <br/>
another adjustable arm with a large magnifying glass, and a third <br/>
arm with a clip for keeping your original drawing handy. The base is <br/>
compact and takes up little space, yet has little "caddies" in the <br/>
base for storing small supplies (blades, etc.). I believe the cost <br/>
was around $90.<br/>
