 I use the grey stuff called Soft-Kut from Dick Blick at<br/>
www.Dickblick.com. I like how soft it is, it doesn't crack when flexed<br/>
and it costs only $6.48 for a sheet about 18" by 12" wide. We would<br/>
not be as good at carving as we are if it wasn't for the price of<br/>
this. I like it better than the pink stuff too. I never have tried the<br/>
MasterCarve since I wouldn't want to get hooked on the pricey stuff:)<br/>
Just thought someone might want to know,<br/>

&gt; It's been forever since I last saw my beloved Pink Stuff, better known<br/>
&gt; as Speedball Speedystamp rubber carving blocks, in stores by itself<br/>
&gt; and not in a beginner's package. Finding it online outside of<br/>
&gt; Speedball's website has even become an issue. Even eBay has failed me<br/>
&gt; here. Does anyone know of a website that sells it? If not, does anyone<br/>
&gt; have any extra that they'd be willing to part with for the going rate?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Looking forward to a winter of stamp carving,<br/>

I like Soft-Kut too, the only draw-backs that I have encountered is <br/>
that it is easy to 'slip' (but at the price, it isn't a 'costly' slip) <br/>
and I also mount it because it has a tendency to 'curl'.  It transfers <br/>
well, carves nicely and (so far) holds up well.  Just my $.02 worth<br/>
