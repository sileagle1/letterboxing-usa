Lavender Letterbox:<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Date Found ________8/7/03<br/>
Condition _________ GOOD<br/>
<br/>
"HI! I'm Wayne Walls. Someone left a "Lavender Letterbox" on the<br/>
Trolley that I drive in Kennebunkport.  I think that they were<br/>
supposed to leave it where they found it right? What do you want me to<br/>
do with it?"<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
This postcard update was sitting in my mailbox as Isosceles and I<br/>
returned from a very eventful weekend...If this isn't the epitome of<br/>
what a "hitchhiker" is...then I'll be darned! This was so funny - the<br/>
box is now traveling safely with this sweet man on some trolley in the<br/>
seaside tourist destination of Kennebunkport, Maine.<br/>
<br/>
What shall I do? Dilemna dilemna....probably I shall contact this dear<br/>
man and request that I have my box returned - perhaps he will keep<br/>
safe watch of it...and I will convert YET ANOTHER poor innocent soul<br/>
into a letterboxing FOOL!!!! Ahahahahahaah ...until then, stay tuned<br/>
for more exciting updates on the (da-da-da-DAH!) "Lavender Letterbox"<br/>

boxers will have to find the right trolleyman and say the secret word <br/>
to get the find. I suppose that leaves out all trolleywomen!<br/>
