I am very excited! This event promises to be spectacular! Just a few <br/>
reminders:<br/>
If you are coming up for the day on Saturday, the park opens at <br/>
6:30am and you can check in at the check-in table located at <br/>
campsite <br/>
#14 anytime between 6:30am and 9:30 am to make it in time for the <br/>
first workshop at 10:00am.<br/>
Please bring your own food for the day since this will not be a <br/>
potluck event.<br/>
There is a $5.00 day use fee and you will need to park in the <br/>
parking <br/>
lot just past the entrance and walk to campsite #14. It is not far <br/>
at <br/>
all.<br/>
There will be raffles throughout the day for some awesome <br/>
letterboxing items and tickets will cost $1.00 each or 6 for $5.00. <br/>
The kid's raffle tickets are free.<br/>
There will also be on hand starter kits with all the items you will <br/>
need to make a letterbox including a carving tool for the stamp <br/>
carving workshop that you can purchase for $5.00 each.<br/>
Donations will be graciously accepted to help offset the cost of the <br/>
event.<br/>
There will be red signs with red, blue and green balloons that will <br/>
direct you to the park from the I-5 freeway. Please watch for them <br/>
and take note of the directions from the post below since there is <br/>
construction in the area.<br/>
Please, and very important, RSVP to tinarie at msn dot com if you <br/>
plan on attending so that we may have enough supplies for everyone.<br/>
This will definitely be an event that will not want to miss. Hope to <br/>
see you there!<br/>

Wouldn't you know it. There is construction going on in the area of <br/>
the directions to Battle Ground Lake found on the link so I will <br/>
give <br/>
you the path you need to travel to get to the Passport To <br/>
Letterboxing Stamp Camp at Battle Ground Lake. Please take note of <br/>
this message before you head out to the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
I-5 freeway, off at exit 9/179th St.,<br/>
 if you are coming from the north, pass under the freeway and make a <br/>
left on NE 10th Ave./SR 502.<br/>
if you are coming from the south, go straight through the light at <br/>
the end of the off ramp onto NE 10th Ave./SR 502.<br/>
Travel 2 miles to NE 219th St/SR 502 and turn right, travel approx. <br/>
10 miles (NE 219th will turn into Main St. when you get into Battle <br/>
Ground) and turn left on Grace Ave., right at NE 229th St./Weisson <br/>
Rd., right onto Palmer Rd. to Battle Ground Lake State Park and turn <br/>
left into the park.<br/>
 There will be red  signs with red, blue and green balloons <br/>
directing <br/>
you from the freeway to the park so keep an eye out for them. See <br/>
you <br/>
there!<br/>
