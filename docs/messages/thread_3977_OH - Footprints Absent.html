MISSING<br/>
<br/>
This afternoon I decided to walk the 2 miles to check up on the Leave <br/>
only Footprints letterbox in Greene County.  I had gotten an email <br/>
from the bayletterboxer who visited there several weeks ago and <br/>
wanted to see his stamp.<br/>
<br/>
When I arrived, the box was in tatters, having been chewed by a <br/>
racoon.  The racoon had gotten the box out from under a 7 lb rock.  <br/>
20 yards away I found the baggie, torn, with the log book soaked in <br/>
the rain.  The rubber stamp was not to be found.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to rescue the page in the log with the stamp impression <br/>
and bayletterboxer's impression.  Pigment stamping does work better <br/>
than water soluble.<br/>
<br/>
I have only put two letterboxes out in containers that previously <br/>
held food.  This was one of them (Icecream container - double washed <br/>
in detergent and hot water)  It was only a couple days after I put <br/>
this box out that I read a posting about problems with containers <br/>
that once held food.  <br/>
<br/>
I will replace the box with a new one and get it back out in the <br/>
woods this winter.  But for now it is not to be found.  I will notify <br/>
the group when it again available.  The new log will contain the <br/>
dried pages from the original log.<br/>
