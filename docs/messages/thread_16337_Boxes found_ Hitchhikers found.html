the reason for my travels, but you have to take the chance when you <br/>
get it!  Found two boxes and one hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
In PA: the Oak Leaf letterbox.  Great location and interesting box.  <br/>
Wanted to get to the Threefalls Series, but time just wouldn't <br/>
permit.  Darn!<br/>
<br/>
In ME:  Just had to stop for the State of Maine box at the rest <br/>
station.  Told the kids that if we could drive straight through from <br/>
PA without stopping at all then we would have time to stop.  They <br/>
made!  And so we got to stop.  What a great way to be welcomed home!  <br/>
While there we picked up the Butterfly Hitchhiker and will set it <br/>
free soon.<br/>
<br/>
And since it is sooooo sunny out (and not yet below frezing) we will <br/>
head out again today to see what we can find!<br/>
