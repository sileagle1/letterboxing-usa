Would you mind looking through your bank statement and see if it didn't come <br/>
through?  I wouldn't want you to write another check.   <br/>

PS<br/>
It probably would be good to respond offline so we don't clutter the list <br/>
with our private conversation.  :o)<br/>

 Hi. Still no patches. I'll send another check and trust the mails will get <br/>
 through this time if that's OK with you. Or, if no order is in the offing, <br/>
 I'll wait until you tell me it's a good time to order again - that is, when <br/>
 you'll be sending another order.<br/>
<br/>
 I would still like five 2 x 2 patches at $2.15 each.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Should I make the check out to Kay Mohmers or Town Hall?<br/>
<br/>
 Second time is the charm.  :o)   Mary Smock &gt;&gt;<br/>
