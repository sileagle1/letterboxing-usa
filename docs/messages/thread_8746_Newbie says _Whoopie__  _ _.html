                    <div class="plaintext-content">My wife and I had a baby (Jack), a year ago on November 2nd.  I've <br/>
taken to taking Jack out hiking in a baby-backpack on the weekends, <br/>
to give my wife a few well-deserved hours of time to herself.  Jack <br/>
really enjoys getting out, seeing the birds and animals, and most <br/>
especially the other people we see on our hikes.  <br/>
<br/>
We'd done a bunch of local hikes on nature trails, and I was <br/>
wondering where to go next.  I remembered reading that Smithsonian <br/>
article some years back, and got on the Internet to see what was <br/>
happening here in the US.  Whoopie!  I just got so excited to see <br/>
what all you great folks have been doing!  How fun!  I spent my <br/>
allowance this week on some erasers and carving tools, and had a load <br/>
of fun making my stamp and researching all the great letterboxes <br/>
folks have been placing.  <br/>
<br/>
So, my son Jack and I went out letterboxing for the first time on <br/>
Saturday afternoon, and we had a wonderful time!  (Although Jack <br/>
slept about half the time, which is average.)  After giving my wife <br/>
clear directions on where we'd be and when we'd be back, we set out <br/>
to find Muk-Luk's four letterboxes in Peace Valley Nature Center, in <br/>
Bucks County, PA.  The day started out wet, but got clear and warmer <br/>
as the day went on.  What fun!  Jack loved seeing the geese and the <br/>
deer, and most especially the nice mountain biker we met who told us <br/>
about the eight-point buck up on the top of the hill (who we didn't <br/>
see... we're pretty noisy).  :)  But mostly we on our own, able to <br/>
hunt quietly for the well-hidden letter boxes.  Finding the first one <br/>
was a thrill, and took some real work... it was pretty well hidden, <br/>
and that makes it even better, like you've earned your stamp.  :)  <br/>
The second one was easier once we got a better idea of what to look <br/>
for.  We never found the third one, "the Mighty Oak", but did find <br/>
the "Flight of the Hawk."  In the stamp book for the Flight of the <br/>
Hawk others said they couldn't find the Might Oak either, but one <br/>
person did say they found it, so I know it's there.  So we'll go back <br/>
someday to look again.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Best of all, now my wife wants to come hiking with us, which has <br/>
always been an anathema to her... tramping around in the woods "where <br/>
there are bugs" is something that's never held any appeal to her.  <br/>
But, framing it as a treasure hunt, now she's interested!  Hooray!  <br/>
<br/>
So anyway, I just wanted to introduce myself and say "Thanks!"  I'm <br/>
so excited to find a hobby that fits in with my schedule and <br/>
interests, and I'm already thinking about where I'm going to place my <br/>
own letterboxes... I have a few favorite hikes that I'd love to <br/>
share, that touch on some neat old ruins and local history, and I'm <br/>
excited to plan the letterboxes I'm going to place!<br/>

I also do my letterboxing with a little one on my back. Although <br/>
she is getting a little haevy now we still stomp through the woods. <br/>
Now that you found this wonderful hobby, I hope that along with <br/>
your stamp and log book you got Jack his own. Even though he is not <br/>
hiking on his own two feet he should still get credit for going. <br/>
Happy Boxing<br/>

     My letterboxing companions include my 25 pound 11-1/2 month old <br/>
son (TRKR) in the backpack and my 4 year old daughter (rnrB) running <br/>
along my side (and occasionally my husband or parents when they can <br/>
manage to take time off from work).  In the past 5 months, we've <br/>
logged finding 114 boxes (average 2 miles per box) at aprox. 228 <br/>
miles and placed 35 boxes (average another 2 miles per box) at <br/>
approx. 70 miles.  Include the several dozen bad attempts at <br/>
locating difficult to find or completely missing or tampered boxes <br/>
for another 24 miles and the occasional maintenance we do on our <br/>
placed box population for another 25 miles.  Boy, have we worked off <br/>
a lot of junk food in the process!!!  With all this fun, who needs a <br/>
membership to the local gym???  AND the best part of all is that <br/>
we're outdoors, learning about where we live, spending time with the <br/>
wildlife and seeing all of God's awesome creations!!!  It has been <br/>
an absolutely incredible experience!!!<br/>
<br/>
      To think just over the last three days, we happened upon a sea <br/>
otter in Monterey, the Loma Prieta Earthquake epicenter in Aptos, <br/>
sycamore trees, stellar jays, GIGANTIC pine cones, lizards, a <br/>
tarantula &amp; mineral baths in San Jose, and a Shakespeare Festival <br/>
amphiteater in Oregon...  AND that was just 3 days!!!  With this <br/>
hobby, everyday is a new adventure!!!<br/>
<br/>
     Welcome aboard and see you on the many letterboxing trails <br/>
around the world!!!<br/>
