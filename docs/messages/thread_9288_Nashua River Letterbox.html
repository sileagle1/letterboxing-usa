<div><br/></div>NASHUA RIVER LETTERBOX, Pepperell, MA Planted 11/20/02 by TEAM 
SPOONHEAD Park at the entry to the Nashua River Rail Trail in East Pepperell 
center. Follow the rail trail south for 1.65 miles to a brown gate on the west 
side of the trail. Take this trail for one tenth of a mile until you see a 
narrow trail on you right. Follow this new trail towards the river. When you get 
to the river, the trail turns left. Go right up to the riverbank and look west. 
At a distance of approximately 100 yards you will see five or six trees (some in 
the river itself) jutting out over the river at a 45 angle. The prize is in a 
hole along the river bank in the midst of these trees. You may want to start 
in Ayer (7 miles away) or Groton (3 miles away) and make it a bike hike. 
However, unless you are into trail riding, you should probably chain your bike 
to the gate when you get off of the rail trail. A shorter walk would be to start 
at the Sand Hill Road entry (.75 mi). If you start at any of these locations, 
you would travel north along the rail trail to the gate. You are looking for a 
clear rubbermaid container with a blue trimmed top. Please note: The letterbox 
contains a variety of trinkets because this location is also a geocache. If you 
take one of the small items you should leave something in return. This is our 
first letterbox and we tried to make it challenging but not impossible! Let me 
know (pmcq@massed.net) how we did! PLEASE RESPOND TO pmcq@massed.net
