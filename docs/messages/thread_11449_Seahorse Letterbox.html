Hi Dancin feet , Yes sorry the seahorse is still on my kitchen <br/>
counter. I have not had a free weekndto go to Maine all winter.  I <br/>
had planned to try a day trip and visit a cousin butthe winter was to <br/>
tough and it is hard to leave farm chores when it is so bad here.  <br/>
   If anyone is going to Maine in the next few weeks  from the Ct. <br/>
area and want to place it for me let me know. Otherwise  the seahorse <br/>
will be here til the calendar frees up a day. Thanks to Rustypuff  &amp; <br/>
CSCM for the rescue and keeping tabs on it. Hope to see them at their <br/>
next gather.   Leader of the Pack<br/>
<br/>
