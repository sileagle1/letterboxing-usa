about every single post in the beginning thinking i should because <br/>
maybe there is something i could learn, maybe the post was a clue. <br/>
Mostly, i've come to realize, this is just one big soap oprea. I <br/>
admit a pretty good one, but it's not more than that.  I've learned <br/>
more about who doesn't like who and have read some pretty good <br/>
arguments.  sometimes i even wish i could watch this whole thing on <br/>
tv and curl up on the couch with a bowl of popcorn or something.  <br/>
Josh has completely stop reading the posts and doesn't like me <br/>
telling him about it anymore either, it's all too much drama for him. <br/>
I just think it's sad that we spend so much time disagreeing about <br/>
petty unimportant stuff rather than talk about what really matters. I <br/>
know that my post isn't going to change a thing but i never post <br/>
anything and felt like i had the right to share my thoughts too.  At <br/>
any rate, now i just read what sounds useful unless i feel like a <br/>
good drama,  then i read everything else too. This seems to be <br/>
working for me.<br/>
