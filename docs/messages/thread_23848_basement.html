<br/>
One is on the Letterboxing North Ameriica website. You can find a link to it in the links section of the main page of the site. The URL is: http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxesArchived.php <br/>
<br/>
Another is a Yahoo group. I believe it was created by Jay Drew when the LBNA site was re-engineered a couple years back. If I understand correctly, the group was created as a repository for clues where the owners couldn't be contacted. The URL is: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-basement/ <br/>

Good Luck!<br/>

I am curious about the basement(?) website that was mentioned earlier <br/>
today. I had clues for two LBs that were not there (I think, lol). I <br/>
emailed the placers and did not get replies. Then this morning I saw <br/>
the post concerning missing or abandoned boxes listed on a website. <br/>

<br/>
and here is the link for the old letterboxing web page <br/>
<br/>
http://lbna.dyndns.org/index.html<br/>
<br/>
both can be a cool sourse for clues to letterboxes not shown on the <br/>
current letterboxing page or atlas quest.  Have fun exploring!!!!!! <br/>
