As far as we know, the first two remain intact.  As for<br/>
number three, well, you'll see why we haven't replaced<br/>
it yet if you do the first two (the same reason that<br/>
makes it such a pity to have vanished makes it difficult<br/>
to replace).<br/>
<br/>
I would highly recommend doing these during the summer,<br/>
though, especially on a weekend (this Sunday would do<br/>
just fine <g>).  The normal presence of students hides<br/>
what a really beautiful campus they have.  ;-)<br/>

lived there but it was quite a while ago (late '70s).  I got my <br/>
masters there too but it was while I was working &amp; didnt spend much <br/>
time at the campus.  I live near by &amp; do appreciate (maybe not <br/>
enough) the beauty of the URI campus. Janet<br/>
