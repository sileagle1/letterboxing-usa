                    <div class="plaintext-content">well, well, well. Team New Hampshire is now a family in the eyes of <br/>
the state. october 14th of 2006 will be a day never forgotten. it <br/>
helps that if i do forget, sarah will shooot me!<br/>
<br/>
so we couldn't have asked for a better wedding day forecast. <br/>
everything went as well as we could have hoped for. for anyone that <br/>
has ever been to Castle in the Clouds, it was such a beautiful day <br/>
with breathe taking views. it had always been a concern of mine that,<br/>
1- weather would have been bad<br/>
2- it would have been cold<br/>
3- the bride not show<br/>
well the bride did show and it ended up being a warmer than expected <br/>
morning. she teared up as she walked to me and i was doing the same. <br/>
we said our "I Do's" and all was done. we had an awesome reception <br/>
and afterwards we were off to the airport to fly to England.<br/>
<br/>
i wish i could have told you the visit to England was flawless, but <br/>
it could have been worse. first we got a car with GPS in it. it came <br/>
in helpful on more than 1 occassion, but not the day we were to find <br/>
our resort. round-abouts, small roads and no places to turn around. <br/>
all spell disaster. did i spell that right? anyhow, we finally find <br/>
our resort and couldn't find our room. finally found our room, but <br/>
no power. finally got the power turned on and went to bed.<br/>
<br/>
went to paris too, for 2 days. tried to go letterboxing there, but <br/>
failed. went to look for 1 box and it was in such an area, there <br/>
shouldn't be a box. but i'm not a native. it is not my say as to <br/>
where someone plants a box. crazy french. wait, i am french. oh <br/>
well. paris was beautiful and we didn't want to leave.<br/>
<br/>
did visit dartmoor. didn't actually realize how far away from <br/>
canterbury it was, but we went anyway. i found 2 boxes and 1 in a <br/>
dartmoor museum in Okehampton. probably not the first choice for us <br/>
in the states to go, but i had clues for there and misplaced others <br/>
for other parts of dartmoor. i did plant 1 of my own though, soon to <br/>
be listed on LBNA. next time i go, i will  be spending a few days <br/>
there. not a couple hours which i didn't know we were doing but <br/>
kinda filled in about on the way. wasn't happy about the time limit, <br/>
but i was just happy in the end to find a few boxes and to visit <br/>
dartmoor itself.<br/>
<br/>
well, i did leave out some important details about your trip, but i <br/>
figured that if i am going to post some pictures on my blog, i <br/>
should leave some of my stories for there.<br/>
<br/>
pictures of the wedding and our trip will soon be posted on my blog. <br/>
just give me a few days.<br/>
