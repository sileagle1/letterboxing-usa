BOX #1 - Hermit Crab Letterbox:  The box is there however it was full of<br/>

<br/>
Yes, it was a beautiful walk, regardless of my other<br/>
complaints!<br/>
<br/>

It must have gotten soaked *again* because I dried it<br/>
out pretty thoroughly when I was there. The stamp was<br/>
there at that time.  Such a shame to have it missing,<br/>
because it was a beautiful stamp!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; BOX #2 - Gathering Letterbox: I believe that this<br/>
&gt; box is gone.  The area at<br/>
&gt; the base of the tree appears to have been cleared<br/>
&gt; out, possibly by the last<br/>

<br/>
I don't think it was me that cleared out the base of<br/>
the tree, because I don't think I even found the right<br/>
tree! It just didn't seem like I was in the right<br/>
place at all. At any rate, I didn't clear out anything<br/>
around any of the trees that I looked at.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; BOX #3 - Resolution Letterbox: This box is alive and<br/>
&gt; well, and the ants are<br/>
&gt; gone.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear those nasty ants are gone!<br/>
