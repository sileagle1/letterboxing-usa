The Denny Creek Primitives<br/>
(a three-box series)<br/>
location: Denny Creek Trail, WA<br/>
nearest town: North Bend?  maybe<br/>
county: King<br/>
placed: 9-1-02<br/>
by: Eliza B/Moderngypsy<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:<br/>
Take I-90 to the Denny Creek exit.  Go left.  At the stop sign, go <br/>
right.  Then at the first left, go that way and follow the signs to the <br/>
Denny Creek Campground.  Go past it .5 mile to the Denny Creek <br/>
Trailhead.  (Turn at the sign and drive OVER the bridge.  The second lot is <br/>
the Denny Creek one, not the first.)  Fill out a little doohickey form so <br/>
that the rangers know you're there, and head on up.<br/>
<br/>
These boxes are beyond the first box, placed by someone else.  Get that one <br/>
first.  They're called "the Primitives" because I got all the way to the <br/>
(insert expletive of choice here) top, and realized my carving tools were <br/>
on the couch....at home.  The first was carved with a pen and a sharpened <br/>
stick.  The second, I discovered that if I pulled the eraser out of my <br/>
pencil and squeezed the metal together, it made a nifty tool (compared to <br/>
the Stick Method, at least.).  So these are...well....kind of <br/>
primitive.  But it's a faboooooo hike.  You must go.<br/>
<br/>
BOX ONE: TABLE ROCK<br/>
 From the Denny Creek box, get back on the trail.  Go up the hill, through <br/>
the sawed-in-half tree, and around several wooded (steep) <br/>
switchbacks.  After a few of these, the forest will just STOP, and it will <br/>
be a rocky field.  Go through several switchbacks (not as steep, but rocky) <br/>
until you get to the place where the trail has to go around a large, flat, <br/>
light grey rock with very little moss on it that looks suitable for laying <br/>
upon.  The trail will curve slightly left around it.  Where the path turns <br/>
right again (and away from the rock), hop up and sit facing the sound of <br/>
water.  To your left and under the lip of the rock, under some foliage and <br/>
wedged in, is the box.<br/>
<br/>
BOX TWO: MOUNTAIN FALLS<br/>
Hop off the rock and continue on the trail, up.  And I do mean UP.  Go <br/>
through all of the rocky field, to where there is a small copse of <br/>
trees.  There will be a felled log to your right, and large snags on both <br/>
left and right of the path, like sentinels.  To your right will be a path <br/>
going down.<br/>
<br/>
Please skip this box if you are less than sure footed, or are extremely <br/>
afraid of heights.  I don't want to be the one to be responsible for your <br/>
death.  That said, continue down that narrow, steep-stepped path, through <br/>
the huckleberry bushes and over a dry creek-looking-thing, onto the flat <br/>
parts that look like steps for a giant.  Go all the way across without <br/>
going up or down, to the creek and admire the beauty further <br/>
upstream.  Stop at the large standalone boulder on the near side.<br/>
<br/>
Scale the steps to the left at 240 to a small stand of twisted <br/>
pines.  Closest to you is a protrusion that looks like a crooked finger, <br/>
pointing the exact wrong way.  Look behind it (closest side to the falls) <br/>
under a grey rock for the box.  Some other, small rocks are covering it.<br/>
<br/>
BOX THREE: CLOUD DANCE<br/>
Get back on the main path, up that steep ol' embankment/trail.  (Or, if you <br/>
skipped box two for height-fear reasons, continue on.)  Go up.  Up, up. up.<br/>
<br/>
Go through all the small switchbacks.  There will be a long, root-filled <br/>
straightaway that goes through a large felled log.  Up a bit, on the right <br/>
side of the path, there is a thin tree and a mostly rotted stump.  If you <br/>
step down, just past it, there's another stump, this one even more rotted <br/>
that the first.  Under the long protrusion on the north side, behind some <br/>
bark...is the Cloud Dance box!  Please make sure to return this one <br/>
carefully -- this is a popular trail and this one can be seen from it if <br/>
you don't really cover it up.<br/>
<br/>
Up ahead, about 200 feet or so, is a fabulous creek and a one-log crossing, <br/>
and another few miles or so up are two lakes that shouldn't be <br/>
missed.  Unfortunately, I was out of boxes, so you'll have to go just for <br/>
the hike. :)<br/>
