<br/>
cORbie and I went out again this afternoon to find two boxes.<br/>
<br/>
First we headed out to Manassas to find the Letterbox Book placed by <br/>
the Doubtful Guest.  Brilliant!!  This was a fantastic box, really <br/>
wonderful.  We were both HIGHLY impressed.  The clue is great, too, and <br/>
proves that I am definitely a librarian's daughter. ;)<br/>
<br/>
We then ventured to the Ghost Castle of Falls Church -- another <br/>
well-written clue and fun find.  :)  Unfortunately, the bottom of this <br/>
box was slightly cracked, and as I re-hid it there was a sickening <br/>
crunch -- If I can make it back there, I'll try to take a new <br/>
container, but I'm not sure if I'll have time before leaving town.  :/<br/>
<br/>
Yay for some fun and entertaining boxes!<br/>
