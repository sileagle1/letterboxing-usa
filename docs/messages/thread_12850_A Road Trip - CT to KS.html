easier boxes along the way.  Since I'm travelling with the <br/>
antiletterboxer, they will have to be fairly short walks, probably <br/>
half and hour or so.  a little more might be ok.  If anyone has <br/>
suggestions, I would sure appreciate them.<br/>
<br/>
Our route is as follows-<br/>
<br/>
Interstates all the way -<br/>
Hartford to Wilkes-Barre on I-84 then I-81 to I-80. <br/>
We will be on I-80 to Youngstown, OH and taking I-76 (I think)to <br/>
Columbus<br/>
Then I-70 all the way to central Kansas.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any tips.  If you don't want to post to the list, feel <br/>
free to send any ideas to rtrw@attbi.com<br/>
