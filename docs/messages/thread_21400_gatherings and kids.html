My kids and I are inseparable when it comes to gatherings (sort of <br/>
comes with the territory given our current 'parenting' situation).  <br/>
If I'm planning an event, I make a great effort to find locales that <br/>
provide a covered 'meeting' facility (like a picnic pavillion) <br/>
adjacent a nice playground for the kids.  This seems to work well <br/>
for events.  Otherwise, we've attended letterboxing gatherings <br/>
planned by others at all sorts of venues from parks, campgrounds, <br/>
shopping malls, private homes, restaurants to pubs and the kids have <br/>
had a great time at every single event!  Since we started <br/>
letterboxing, my kids have ranged from 8 months to current 6+ years <br/>
old.  They often ask/beg to attend future events--they've had that <br/>
much fun--even hiking long distances!!!<br/>
<br/>
A funny story would be about the 2-3 day long Battleground Lake <br/>
Stamp Camp we attended near Vancouver, WA in Aug 04.  We capped <br/>
Saturday's events with a grand 'bonfire' for the group at one of the <br/>
campsites--my kids (then 2-1/2 and 5-1/2) were so exhausted after <br/>
the incredible day they experienced that they both fell asleep atop <br/>
my Camelback backpack directly on the dirt/gravel ground and didn't <br/>
budge an inch the entire bonfire!!!  The resulting photographs were <br/>
hilarious!!!  <br/>

I agree that kids absolutely love the feeding frenzy of stamp <br/>
exchanges.  If there are other kids present, they will find one <br/>
another for extracurricular activities that are usually very benign!<br/>

As one of the organizers for the upcoming Gold Rush Romp in Old <br/>
