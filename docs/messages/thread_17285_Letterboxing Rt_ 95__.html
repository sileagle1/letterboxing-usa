located near highways? I was wondering if such a list actually exists.<br/>
Since I drive back and forth to NYC from Maine fairly often a nice<br/>
letterbox would be a great reason to get out of the car and stretch my<br/>
poor legs. I'm just not familiar with some of the place names and<br/>
towns in other states, so it is hard to map them out in my mind. <br/>
I don't mean only drive-bys either. Just ones that are conveniently<br/>
located and would be a nice stop.<br/>
Anyone? You can email me at amymisha@dialmaine.com.<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

In Maine you might try "Rest and Relaxation" off exit 30 in Augusta,<br/>
"Laudholm Quest" off exit 2 in Wells, or "State of Maine" in York. All<br/>
are within a 5 minute drive of the highway.<br/>

Poor legs.  Sheeze!  You should try *walking* to NYC from Maine and <br/>

A beautiful, fun and rewarding hike with Brian's ultra-cool stamps, YES! but <br/>
I'm not so sure about "quick". It took Christopher and I a couple of visits to <br/>
do the whole thing....I'm not sure how Brian and Ryan planted them all in one <br/>
day...perhaps they are bionic!  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Regardless though, it's a series that's well worth a day of your time. It's <br/>
one of my favorites to date. <br/>
