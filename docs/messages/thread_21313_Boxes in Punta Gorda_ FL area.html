<br/>
I will be in FL for a week - leaving this Thursday.  I looked on the LBNA website and see some boxes in the Fort Myers area, but none closer to Punta Gorda.  Is anyone aware of an unofficial site that might have boxes listed or unpublished boxes?  I did contact a few of the placers for the Fort Myers boxes.  Some of the boxes require obtaining menus and getting words off of them to find the location of the letterboxes.  My friends aren't into letterboxing, so I don't think I will be able to get that involved, but a hike or driveby would work.  Any information is appreciated.<br/>

We recently drove through the Punta Gorda area.  It was devastated <br/>
by 3 hurricanes in 2004.  At this point, we found most people still <br/>
involved in cleanup and rebuilding.  Didn't even stop to search for <br/>
boxes in Punta Gorda, if any exist that weren't washed away.<br/>

Unfortunately, Florida is still relatively new to letterboxing. There <br/>
are not enough locals involved in the sport. A lot of the boxes in <br/>
Florida are hidden by folks visiting on vacation or snowbirds who <br/>
make it down once a year and when the boxes go missing, they are <br/>
often missing for good.  <br/>

Folks on vacation? Snowbirds? A-yuh!<br/>
<br/>
The trip to Ft. Myers would be worth it. You should be able to find these boxes safe <br/>
and sound (I did when I was down there just after Christmas):<br/>

There's lots of places to hide a letterbox or two, too! (hint hint)<br/>

I sure enjoyed yor boxes in St. Pete and took my<br/>
sister and brother in law along.  They are hooked now<br/>
so hopefully they can get some planted.  :)<br/>
