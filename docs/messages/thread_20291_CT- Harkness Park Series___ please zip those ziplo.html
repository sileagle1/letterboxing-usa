                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today The Family went hunting for the Harkness Park Series which was <br/>
a particular challenge since we stumbled into Family Day at the <br/>
park.  We didn't have to pay the entrance fee, but we did have to <br/>
endure the kids being distracted by carriage rides, popcorn, face <br/>
painting, etc... YIPEE!  SO- we didn't even bother attemting the <br/>
boxes until everyone started clearing out of the park around 4ish.  <br/>
At any event- the situation, I'm sad to report, was not grand.<br/>
<br/>
As we expected we were unable to find the McCann Family LB.  <br/>
However, since we have been known to overlook a box or two in our <br/>
time, we do not claim to be the beat-all-end-all pronouncement of <br/>
the missing box.  We'll still let Music Woman do that I think.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Harkness Orchard Box was there, intact &amp; in the best shape of all <br/>
the boxes- although it had not been properly sealed (easily <br/>
remedied).  We did have to pretend to be VERY interested in the <br/>
orchard though as the very time we were retreiving the box was when <br/>
the park staff was apparently returning vehicles &amp; other equipment <br/>
to whatever building is at the bottom of the orchard.  That was <br/>
fun.  We spent a LOT of time being interested in that orchard by <br/>
golly!<br/>
<br/>
Daffodil Lane box was a shambles I'm afraid.  The two small logbooks <br/>
inside were SOAKED through.  I've brought them home in an attempt to <br/>
dry them out &amp; salvage them for Music Woman (I emailed Music Woman <br/>
to let her know since I know she lives too far away to retrieve them <br/>
herself).  I've replaced with a new ziplock &amp; added some paper from <br/>
my logbook.  There was a separate piece of paper (also wet) that had <br/>
been added on 9/7 that said the books were wet so it's been at least <br/>
through the week- if anyone else has been there recently, you might <br/>
want to let Music Woman know.  But I'm going to try to save as much <br/>
from the logs as I can (any suggestions would be VERY welcome!  I'm <br/>
about to hit the blowdryer!).<br/>
<br/>
Eolia Mansion LB was also intact, but again, the ziplock was <br/>
shredded &amp; ripped down both sides.  We replaced it &amp; made sure that <br/>
the log book was INSIDE the ziplock (I believe that in the orchard <br/>
box the log was not in the ziplock either, but I'm not positive).  <br/>
<br/>
A great series, but a sad find with the ruined logs.  PLEASE make <br/>
sure that you bag those before you pack the box back up.  It's a <br/>
shame to lose all those notes &amp; stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
Off to my dryer!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am totally appalled at the lack of consideration that people in CT are <br/>
exhibiting at boxes lately.  I too have been to NUMEROUS boxes within the last <br/>
couple of weeks with logbooks TOTALLY not in ANY ziplocks.  Hello???????  The <br/>
logbooks need to keep DRY!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks SO much to Lynnie for rescuing my logs.  I will try to get down to <br/>
Harkness to pull all boxes for repair ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
Please everyone, please show some consideration and leave the boxes BETTER <br/>
than how you found it!<br/>
