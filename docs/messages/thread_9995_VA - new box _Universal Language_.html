desk is littered with dictionaries and the brain is fried.  Please let us <br/>
know if you all have any troubles with the clues as we are so confused <br/>
ourselves at this point...  But, don't let this, the cold and the drizzle <br/>
discourage you!!  Have fun!  BeMa<br/>

THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE BOX<br/>
<br/>
Freedom Hill Park<br/>
Old Courthouse Rd.<br/>
Vienna, VA<br/>
Planted by BeMa<br/>

<br/>
One of the things that we really like about the DC area is the diversity of <br/>
its people.  Whether due to the diplomatic community or just a popular place <br/>
for immigrants, one can meet people from all over the world just around the <br/>
corner!<br/>
<br/>
So, it is to those people (and those who came before  our relatives being <br/>
some of them  and those who were already here when we came) that we <br/>
dedicate this next box call Universal Language.  It is fittingly placed in <br/>
a park called freedom as freedom is what brought many to this country to <br/>
start with.<br/>
<br/>
O.K.  enough with the sentimentality.  The trick to finding this box is in <br/>
translating the parts of the clues that are in one of five european <br/>
languages (only three of which we speak and none too well.).  If you have <br/>
any trouble, you can try a bi -lingual friend, a dictionary or one of the <br/>
free translating services on the web.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and Buena Suerte!  Bonne Chance!  Viel Gluck!  Buono Fortuna!  Boas <br/>
de Sorte!<br/>
<br/>
Estacione in the circular Parkplatz and proceed to the segno o parque <br/>
listing all the reglement (park closes at dark, etc.)   Comenzando at that <br/>
senal, count off dreizehn parking spaces heading in a direction dans le sens <br/>
inverse des aiguilles dune montre.<br/>
<br/>
Go down the paved Pfad you are facing, entre les arbres.  Pass the cour de <br/>
jeu a la sinistra.  Pass dois rust-colored poteaux.  Stop at the il terzo <br/>
poteau.  Stand with your dos toward the odd ampitheater-like area (could <br/>
it be a pequena plaza de toros?  An enclosure for les ours de Bern?  Un <br/>
luoga di ballare the polka round and round? We think it was the scene of an <br/>
Oktoberfest judging from all the beer cans we cleaned up there!).<br/>
<br/>
Take a reading of zweihundertundvierzig Grad which should point you toward a <br/>
sentier de terre heading into a floresta.  From the path  side of il <br/>
marciapiede , count cinquenta e tres Schritte into la foresta following this <br/>
ungepflastertem.  You should see a arvore a la derecha with a bar <br/>
zweigstelle (at about thigh-height) that parece como a spigot for tapping <br/>
Ahorn sirup.<br/>
<br/>
Continue ocho pasos from this baum and use your brujula to find <br/>
dreihundertundvierzig degrees.  Take cinque steps in that direction.  You <br/>
should see deux arbres conjuntos ahead.  The mais magrinho looks like a <br/>
candy cane with diagonal cicatrices made from plante grimpante que ya no <br/>
esta.<br/>
<br/>
Look dietro these alberi au-dessous dun petit bloc de ciment, les feuilles, <br/>
ramos pequenos, etc. Voila!  Bien venue, bienvenida, benvenuto, boas vindas <br/>
und willkommen!  You have found a UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE for us all!<br/>
<br/>
We hope that you found this box muy divertido, uma aventura, viel Spass, <br/>
piacevole et un veritable tresor extraordinaire!  We would love to hear from <br/>
you, in any language, at bema57@hotmail.com.<br/>
