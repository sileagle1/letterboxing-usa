I have been reading about letterboxing and have not been able to find<br/>
out something I am seeking so I am hopeful to find some help here.<br/>
<br/>
After finding a box, one is to stamp a personal book with the box's<br/>
stamp and then stamp the box's book with a personal stamp.  I have<br/>
also read that one should add the date and time to box's book.<br/>
<br/>
My question is what do most folks do with their personal books?  Do<br/>
you just stamp it or do you write something about the experience in it<br/>
as a personal log book?  If not, how does one remember from what<br/>
letterbox each stamp comes from?<br/>

I write the name and location of the box, and usually the placer and the date <br/>
it was placed.   Then, if something memorable happened on the hike, I'll jot <br/>
that down, too.<br/>

What you add to your stamped page in a found letterbox is really up to you, although I think most boxers add at least the date they stamped in.  I have seen the time logged as well, and that can be fun when you see you're right on someone's tail and may meet up with them especially if it's a series!<br/>
<br/>
With your own logbook as well, it's all up to you what you add: Name of box, name of box creator, date, location and  if you're counting #'s maybe the # of find.  Sometimes I add a little more like who I was boxing with that day or any other memory.  Get creative, have FUN and BOX ON!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think each person has a different idea of what they want their logbooks to contain. <br/>
<br/>
Personally, my book is probably more of a memory book than just a "stamp collection". I include the stamp image, of course, but then I tend to write a kind of diary note with it...date, time, stamp creator/originator, location, who was boxing with me that day or maybe a memory of something fun or memorable that happened while we were looking for the box. I even include a time/location line for found hitchikers (where it originated and all of the stops along the way to track where all it went before I found it).<br/>
<br/>
I also include little things I may have found in the box or while looking for it (for example: I have a Florida quarter taped on the page that was a "first finder" treasure, a sticker found in a box and even a perfect Magnolia leaf given to me by a LB friend while searching for a stamp)...basically anything I want to include to help me remember the event. <br/>
<br/>
It's really all a person's point of view of what they want their logbook to be. Some boxers prefer a more technical book with just the stamp, date, location. Some prefer more of a memory book like mine. I've even ran across some that stamp in a 2nd temporary book and then transfer it to a scrapbooking project/binder after the fact complete with designing each page specifically for that stamp (using paper techniques, stickers . . . actual scrapbooking techniques and layout). Some people have one logbook. Some have different books for different types of stamps. Some have made a computer "database" of their logbook.<br/>
<br/>
It really is all up to you. Like the late artist, Bob Ross, used to say, "It's your world. Make it however you want it." <g><br/>

One day, my husband, black lab and I had hiked about a mile through a field and into the woods following the clues. Just as we got to the LB site and logged in, we were welcomed by a huge clap of thunder. As the three of us raced back down the trail, I realized I had left in such a hurry that I had left my backpack under the tree and had to run back for it. By the time I got back to the car, huffing and puffing and soaking wet, my husband and dog were sitting in the Jeep calmly listening to a ball game. Actually it was funny and I do enjoy reading back on some of our "misadventures". It's also helpful to be able to read your notes on finding the LB's so you can share your experiences with others who may be wanting to seek out the same box. I usually note my personal impression of if a box is located in an area that is difficult or strenuous to get to. (Some boxes may be classified as a moderate hike and end up being more than "moderate" in my estimation.)<br/>

definitely journal. where you found it...what you were thinking...was <br/>
it frustrating? did you find it right away? was the spot in a beautiful <br/>
location on a trail or just a quick walk down a hill? If you travel <br/>
with a group who found it? Were the clues easy to follow? Did you pick <br/>
up a hitch-hiker?<br/>

I have a different response that I haven't seen here:<br/>
<br/>
I like to write the clues! I would like to be able to take someone up<br/>
to where the box was months later. I also keep somewhat of a journal,<br/>
with scraps, brochures, maps, or photos.<br/>
<br/>
It never even occured to me how different everyone would be keeping<br/>
their personal logbooks. How interesting!<br/>

I can remember every stamp I've found, so far, where it is and a <br/>
little story about finding it just by looking at the stamp...granted <br/>
I only? have found 67 but I think I'll be able to do this for all of <br/>
my future finds too, they're all great, memorable experiences.<br/>
oh and to answer your question, I stamp on my clue sheets and put <br/>
them in a 3 ring binder(if it good enough for Wanda &amp; Pete...) we <br/>
also used to keep little notes about what we saw and asked the kids <br/>
what they remembered the most about the trip.-WW<br/>
