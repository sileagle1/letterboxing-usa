<br/>The Keyes Brook Letterbox 
<br/>East Princeton, MA 
<br/>
<br/>Placed by Barry and Betsy Chase 
<br/>Date Placed: 11-9-02 
<br/>Time and Length: Less than 30 minutes, less than a half mile round trip. 
<br/>Difficulty: Although most of this walk is flat, there are some rocks and a small hill involved. 
<br/>Directions: 
<br/>Take Rte 140 to E. Princeton.  Turn down Gleason Road.  Cross over stream and park on the flat rocks on the right.  Walk back over the stream and head downstream on the left bank.  Walk until the end of where the stones have been worked into a channel. There are 4 large table rocks laying below you in the stream bed.  Look for a forked maple tree nearby.  At a bearing of 90 degrees you will see an 8' high rock ledge.  Take about 25 steps to the beginning of the ledge.  The box is at the end of the ledge wall.  It is also a geocache.   
<br/>
<br/>This location is the site of the second Temple-Stuart Chair Factory.  Around 1840, Benjamin Stuart moved his chair factory from nearby West Sterling to take advantage of the increased water power of Keyes Brook. By 1850, he was shipping 20,000 chairs per year out of this location.  Several other mills were located on this stretch of the brook.  Today it is a beautiful area for a picnic or short hike.  Much can be seen of the early foundations of the mills along the stream. </body></html>
