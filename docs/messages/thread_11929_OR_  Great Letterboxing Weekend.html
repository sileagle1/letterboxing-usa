<br/>
It was a great weekend of letterboxing.  Yesterday, John and I were in<br/>
the Corvallis area.  We wanted to nab the Mary's Peak Letterbox, but the<br/>
road was still closed 4 miles from the trailhead due to snow.  Oh well.<br/>
Maybe later in the spring.  I did manage to place my first letterbox of<br/>
the year down there, though - The Woodpecker Trail Letterbox.  John<br/>
verified clues.  You should have no trouble finding it.  <br/>
<br/>
Today, we headed out to Molalla River State Park in Canby and placed the<br/>
Canby Ferry Letterbox.  I've had this stamp carved (from a photo off the<br/>
internet sort of) for a long time, but just got around to placing this<br/>
weekend.  After that, we had spent a soggy time hiking and hunting down<br/>
the Bluebird Trail Letterbox placed by Funhog at Champoeg State Park.<br/>
This was no drive-by.  What started out as a lovely sunny day ended up<br/>
as a torrential monsoon during our whole hike there.  However,<br/>
eventually the treasure revealed itself and we were greatly rewarded.<br/>
Thanks for placing, Funhog!<br/>
<br/>
We have been going out as often as we can to find letterboxes this year,<br/>
but Woodpecker and Canby Ferry are the first ones I've placed so far in<br/>
2003.  I hope they are worth finding!  <br/>
<br/>
Take care everyone.  Sounds like Molly Day on the East Coast was a huge<br/>
success!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
