                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
I'm new to letterboxing and don't even have a stamp and journal yet. <br/>
I wanted to try and find one before I spent any money. My partner and <br/>
our two kids (ages 3 and 12) went out today and found both Brandywine <br/>
Springs boxes in Wilmington, DE.  We had a blast! My partner read the <br/>
compass wrong (the degrees aren't marked on ours) and we spent about <br/>
half an hour not finding anything. LOL But, the park was once an <br/>
amusement park and the ruins of it are still in the woods, so it was <br/>
neat to see all that stuff. We ate lunch on the trail, sitting in the <br/>
middle of the remains of the carousel. :)<br/>
On the way home, we stopped and got supplies to make our stamps and <br/>
journals. We can't wait to find our next box, and to go back to the <br/>
ones we found today to get our journals stamped. <br/>
I just wanted to post and say what a great activity/sport <br/>
letterboxing is, and I hope it continues to grow. <br/>

PS-I know that F is found and P is place, but what are the other <br/>
numbers? Somebody help out a rookie. :)<br/>

Here's an article that might help clear things up -- or, OTOH, might leave <br/>
you with more questions!<br/>

As for me, X=exchanges (when you meet other letterboxers,you exchange stamped <br/>
images in your books) <br/>
A=attempted (but not found or missing. This is not a traditional 'letter' <br/>
just MY way on ranting--you'll find there are no rules and we make stuff up all <br/>
the time!) <br/>
V=virtuals. These are boxes you find without leaving home. Look on the <br/>
website. <br/>
HH=hitchhiker, a stamp someone plants in a box as an 'extra'. The first <br/>
person to find it, takes it to another box and leaves it there, and so on. HHs have <br/>
their own log books so you do the same thing with them as 'normal' stamps but <br/>
instead of counting them as an F, it's an HH.<br/>
<br/>
Other people use other 'letters' but they'll tell you what they stand for. <br/>
Psychomommys "L" is the best!<br/>
<br/>
As for the Brandywine Springs boxes, we tried to find it (there was only one <br/>
a few months ago)when we visited DE in May but the box was missing. I replaced <br/>
it with the "quilt" stamp (which was meant as an HH but this missing box <br/>
needed it more) and the 'owner' of the box placed another one, the 2nd you found <br/>
probably, leaving mine in the original place. Glad to know they are thriving! <br/>
Thanks for writing in!<br/>

It's great to have a fellow Letterboxer from Delaware on board.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you enjoyed the Brandywine Springs boxes. In the original <br/>
box, we included a lot of information about the history of the park <br/>
and our personal connection to the park - My wife's (Ms. Pink) great <br/>
grandfather managed the hotel that was were the parking lot is now. <br/>
That box turned up missing last spring and was graciously replaced by <br/>
Doublesj.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the scoop on the local boxes:<br/>
1. Pea Patch Island - This was the first box we attempted. We <br/>
couldn't find it, as some of the landmarks in the clue were no longer <br/>
there. The island is muggy, buggy and thorny. You will want to get a <br/>
few boxes under your belt before attempting.<br/>
2. Brandywine Box - Pretty straight forward. Not a lot of tree cover, <br/>
so I wouldn't recommend on hot, humid days.<br/>
3. Wolf Box - Straight forward and in the woods. I think there may <br/>
have been a post that someone could not find the box.<br/>
4. Dance of Joy - Very easy, quick<br/>
5. Honor and Spirit - two new boxes planted between Chadd's Ford and <br/>
West Chester. Pretty quick and easy boxes. FYI: Spirit is in a <br/>
cemetery (Ms. Pink didn't like boxing in a cemetery).<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully by the end of the summer/early fall we plan to plant some <br/>
new boxes in Carousel park and Bellevue State Park.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome again and have fun boxing,<br/>
