<br/>       This box was placed by my Oldest Team at the YMCA Summer Fun Club Day 
<br/>Camp.  They have been searching for boxes all summer every Tuesday for 5 
<br/>weeks.  They found the boxes at Mansfield Hollow and Devils Hopyard and 
<br/>Wadsworth Falls.  We were not so lucky at Sleeping Giant, but had fun anyway. 
<br/>On the last week we decided to place our own box.  We went on a trip to the 
<br/>Session Woods Wildlife Management Area.  It is a beautiful place with several 
<br/>nice trails.  You can pick up trail maps in their building or at thier 
<br/>website.  Take the trial in either direction.  We started behind the 
<br/>maintenance sheds, but you can also start at the Beaver Dam Trail (this is a 
<br/>lot longer).  Either way follow the trail until you reach the waterfall 
<br/>trail. Follow this short trail until you reach the wooden stairs.  Go down to 
<br/>the bottom of the stairs.  Standing on the last stair look to the right.  
<br/>Climb this steep rocky hill passing between two large triangular rocks.  
<br/>After you pass the two rocks bear right.  You will see three large rocks that 
<br/>look as though they have been sliced.  Behind this rock formation is your 
<br/>prize!!  Good Luck and Have Fun!!

We planted a four box Smokey Bear series at Session Woods today<br/>
also. The clues will be up in a couple of days. The good thing is<br/>
that we didn't put one by the waterfall.<br/>
