Closest Town:  Shasta or French Gulch<br/>
Closest City:  Redding<br/>
County:  Shasta<br/>
State:  California<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Take I-5 to Redding, then CA 299 West for approximately <br/>
10 miles.  Turn Left on JFK Memorial Dr and contribute an Abe Lincoln.<br/>
<br/>
Hint:  A trail map will make this much easier!!!<br/>
<br/>
Goldrush! Letterbox #1<br/>
<br/>
Trek ranges from 1.5-3.5 miles on dirt/gravel hilly trail.  Do some <br/>
homework if you desire a shorter hike, knowing, however, that you <br/>
will miss out on some incredible views of a nice lake if you truncate <br/>
your visit.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  From the entrance to the Shasta Mine Shaft, head SE 22 paces, <br/>
face 45 degrees, 7 steps in a cubby hole at eye level lies your <br/>
motherlode!  Eureka!  Goldrush!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Glory Hole of a Dam Letterbox #2<br/>
<br/>
Drive by! Little walking involved.  Just use your noggin!<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  Find the cylindrical concrete structure in the shape of a <br/>
morning glory to the N of the dam.  From the placard that describes <br/>
it, head NE to the black button.  Due NW of the button lies a <br/>
concrete cub, if within it you peer, your prize is sitting a bit <br/>
behind it &amp; right rear.<br/>
<br/>
Crystal Creek Falls Letterbox #3<br/>
<br/>
Slight, easy hike although short, steep slope involved.<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:  9 miles further W on CA 299, turn left on Crystal Creek <br/>
Road for about 2 miles.  Just after the yellow 'locked gate ahead 200 <br/>
feet' sign, turn left into quarry area.  Take the gravel/sandy road <br/>
about 1/2 mile and park on the left.  Walk further along the road to <br/>
a steel gate.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  From steel gate, head E along high road above Crystal Creek <br/>
to a large granite boulder and steel guard.  From the fir betwixt the <br/>
two, head E down to a sawn stump.  5 steps NW to a boulder with a <br/>
circle on its brim.  Your prize lies in a cubby hole, bottom left <br/>
beneath some granite.<br/>

either--it's practically sitting on 299 not terribly far from the <br/>
Whiskey series!  ;)  There are also about 6 other LBs in a 60+ mile <br/>
radius around Redding &amp; I-5, too!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the new boxes in the area.  Unfortunately, we're moving on in a <br/>
few days and won't be around to babysit them...  :(<br/>
