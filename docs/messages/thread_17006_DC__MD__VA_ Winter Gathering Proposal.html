&gt;<br/>
&gt;Would love to get together!  I can't do the weekends of 1/31 or 2/28 at <br/>
&gt;all.  I will also be busy either 2/21 or 2/22.  I may be unavailable the <br/>
&gt;weekend of 1/10 as well.  And 2/14 is a Saturday Valentine's Day, which <br/>
&gt;doesn't seem the optimal choice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Would be bringing two very little ones - almost 5 by that time and almost 2 <br/>
&gt;by that time.  Littler one would need a stroller if it's longer than a very <br/>
&gt;short get-together, s something stroller-friendly is a must for us.  Prefer <br/>
&gt;not going downtown unless parking is easy.  Anything at/in the Building <br/>
&gt;Museum would be OK, though - that place is pretty cool &amp; has plenty of room <br/>
&gt;for the kids to blow off steam.  Maybe we could go there on one of their <br/>
&gt;event days?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope it works out!<br/>
