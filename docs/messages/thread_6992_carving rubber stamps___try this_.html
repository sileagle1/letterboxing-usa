&gt;<br/>
&gt;LBNA page listed as:  The Russ Clan's Letterboxes<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Amy has kindly allowed us to replace and adopt her two boxes in Redwing Park. <br/>
&gt; Both had been swiped so here's the first replacement...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Garden Gnome II<br/>
&gt;(most of the cleverly written clues are hers--we've added a different ending <br/>
&gt;to accommodate the new location).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Redwing Park is located in Virginia Beach at 1398 General Booth Blvd., not <br/>
&gt;far from the Oceanfront.  (These boxes are very near the "Flame of Hope" <br/>
&gt;stamp on Oceana Blvd.)  Bring a lunch to enjoy in the picnic area after <br/>
&gt;stamping in.  There's a nice small playground for the kids to burn off extra <br/>
&gt;energy as well as a nice small playground for your pooch too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Park in the first parking lot to your left as you enter the park.  You may <br/>
&gt;wish to enjoy the Japanese and Rose gardens before beginning your search.  <br/>
&gt;Cross the road and enter the Redwing Gardens.  The Garden Gnome eagerly <br/>
&gt;awaits your arrival.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Start your search at the Redwing Gardens sign just inside the ivy garlanded <br/>
&gt;white fence.  Before you lay four different paths.  Which one to take to <br/>
&gt;visit with the Garden Gnome?  Take the 1st paved trail heading east.  Stay on <br/>
&gt;this trail for a little while until two bridges come into sight.  Under one <br/>
&gt;bridge once lived an evil<br/>
&gt;troll.  Some say the metal railings on this bridge acted as a lightening rod <br/>
&gt;causing him to be hit many times over the years by these terrifying bolts.  <br/>
&gt;This surely caused a bit of his insanity and outright meanness.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Our kindly Garden Gnome spends his time tending the gardens in Redwing <br/>
&gt;Park...he used to live under the other bridge. The wooden construction of his <br/>
&gt;home kept him safe from lightening storms but he had a tendency to sail away <br/>
&gt;down the stream in his little Rubbermaid boat when it rained. So, after a <br/>
&gt;particularly long journey toward the open ocean he decided to move.  To find <br/>
&gt;his new home he thought he'd visit the evil troll under the other bridge and <br/>
&gt;ask his neighborly advice regarding shelter....that's where things went <br/>
&gt;wrong.  After waking the grumpy troll, quite a nasty brawl ensued...the evil <br/>
&gt;troll fell into the water and has been rumored to have crawled aground and is <br/>
&gt;hiding in the underbrush waiting to plot his revenge.  Maybe he'll have his <br/>
&gt;very own box soon...but back to the story.  The kind Garden Gnome wants to <br/>
&gt;prevent anyone from being lightening bolted into meanness again and now lives <br/>
&gt;under the metal bridge.  He carries a lightening rod to protect all creatures <br/>
&gt;great and small from harm in Redwing Park.  There you'll find him, under this <br/>
&gt;bridge where he sleeps when he's not tending the gardens.  Make sure to <br/>
&gt;whisper his name as you approach so that he doesn't think you're the evil <br/>
&gt;troll,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please do your best not to be seen retrieving this box as it has a habit of <br/>
&gt;disappearing...and this can be a busy park.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi Tate, Sue, and Sara ~<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Headed out today with our company to find your "Cupcake" Letterboxes.  Just wanted to let you know that the 2nd stamp in <br/>
this series is broken in four pieces.  We stamped it one piece at a time to get it to (almost) work.  Just thought you'd like to <br/>
know.  Both boxes were in great condition as were the contents of both (except for the stamp).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for a great adventure ~ we love using our compass to find the treasures.  My friend is now hooked on Letterboxing <br/>
and can't wait to get out and find some more!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Warmest regards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;Subject: Boxes in the Portland ME area<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Greetings,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In about two weeks, my family and I are going to go to Sebago Lake for a week <br/>
&gt;of camping. Obviously, we're going to get in some letterboxing while we're <br/>
&gt;there. I've gone through a lot of the clues for boxes in that area, and I was <br/>
&gt;wondering if anyone knew about the status of any of these boxes. Secondly, is <br/>
&gt;there anyone on list that would consider adopting a box if we planted one <br/>
&gt;while we're there? Sebago Lake is about four hours from where we live, so we <br/>
&gt;would not be able to maintain it.<br/>

&gt;Subject: Re: Re:Stamps and carving..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When my boyfriend's granddaughter and I went to Michael's last month to<br/>
&gt;get her all set up with carving tool, tips and rubber we asked where the<br/>
&gt;carving materials were.  Two employees told us they had no such thing<br/>
&gt;and told us if they were anywhere they'd be in the rubber stamp section,<br/>
&gt;but they had never heard about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;HOWEVER...we walked all through the store and finally found a little<br/>
&gt;section where this stuff was on the shelf.  It may be there, but they<br/>
&gt;may not understand what you're talking about, even if you use brand<br/>
&gt;names.  It certainly was far, far away from the commercial rubber stamp<br/>
&gt;and ink section and it was clear in the back of the store.  Sort of near<br/>
&gt;the framing section.  I think they just put that merchandise way where<br/>
&gt;they had a spare spot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My advice is to do some legwork (literally) in the store.  Walk around<br/>
&gt;and keep your eyes peeled. Chances are it is there stashed someplace,<br/>
&gt;and nowhere logical at that.  Store personnel may tell you they don't<br/>
&gt;have it, but if you hunt and seek, as you often do in general with this<br/>
&gt;sport, you may be rewarded!  <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;Best regards,<br/>

&gt;"Drakes and their dog Buddy" have kindly allowed us to replace and adopt her <br/>
&gt;two boxes in Redwing Park.  Both had been swiped so here's the second <br/>
&gt;replacement...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;"Redwing II"<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you "Drakes and their Buddy" for these clues:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;From the wooden bridge, facing Garden Gnome's new home take a bearing of 260 <br/>
&gt;degrees.  Continue on your journey by following the paved path to your left.  <br/>
&gt;The Garden Gnome would like you to enjoy the many flowering bushes and trees <br/>
&gt;as you go.  Soon you will come upon a stone-encased water fountain/bubbler on <br/>
&gt;your right.  Continue this path to the Fragrance Gardens.  The Fragrance <br/>
&gt;Gardens were planted especially for the blind to enjoy but we're sure you <br/>
&gt;will enjoy the beautiful smells too.  Take a moment to smell the Dwarf <br/>
&gt;Gardenia, the Pitosporum, the Lilac and the Anise Bushes.  Find the Ligustrum <br/>
&gt;bush and take a bearing of 32 degrees to the paved path.  Follow the paved <br/>
&gt;path bearing to the left as it meanders around the topiary.  Before reaching <br/>
&gt;the covered wishing well you will see a gravel path to your right.  Take the <br/>
&gt;gravel path.  Shortly you must decide which path to choose.  At the <br/>
&gt;intersection of many paths take a bearing of 100 degrees.  20 paces ahead you <br/>
&gt;will find the Mrs. C.L. Hershberger crepe myrtle memorial tree.  From here <br/>
&gt;locate the "U" shaped tree.  At the "U" shaped tree follow the gravel path to <br/>
&gt;the right until it connects again with the paved path.  Take a left onto this <br/>
&gt;path.  Continue on, bearing left to your second gravel path on the left.  <br/>
&gt;Nestled within the trees here (bearing 350 degrees) is a bench to take a <br/>
&gt;rest.  While sitting on the bench locate the pair of trees growing together <br/>
&gt;to your left.  You'll find the Redwing II stamp hidden under the pine needles <br/>
&gt;in a small cubby at the base of the tree nearest to the bench.  Stamp in and <br/>
&gt;rehide well.  Enjoy!<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;Within Redwing Park you will find another lovely little park. <br/>
&gt;It has a beautiful Japanese name,<br/>
&gt;and a little Zen rock garden. <br/>
&gt;With a little babbling brook, <br/>

&gt;This is true always in all Michael's stores.  I'm convinced that clerks<br/>

&gt;There is a rubber stamp store in the Providence Square shopping <br/>
&gt;center near Birdneck music (or whatever its called)  You might <br/>
&gt;want to look there for supplies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also try paul's arts and crafts on Lynnhaven.  I havent looked there <br/>
&gt;yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Michaels on Va beach blvd near Pembroke mall DOES have <br/>
&gt;carving supplies.  Its right to the right of the stamp section.  You'll <br/>
&gt;see a shelf that has pens and bottles of ink.  Go to the end of the <br/>
&gt;row and you'll find some linoleum carving tools and sheets of pink <br/>
&gt;eraser.  That's what I picked up for my stamps so far.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;LOL!  this sounds like a letterbox hunt for supplies!  LOL<br/>

&gt;I guess I was lucky that I happend to grab a manager.  I asked for <br/>
&gt;Speedball stuff and she said its all in the Art Section.  Right next <br/>
&gt;to the rubber stamps.  Its a row of pens, inks, etc.  I was able to <br/>
&gt;find lineoleum carving tools and the speedball rubber eraser sheet.<br/>

&gt;&gt; When my boyfriend's granddaughter and I went to Michael's last month<br/>
&gt;&gt; to get her all set up with carving tool, tips and rubber we asked<br/>
&gt;&gt; where the carving materials were.  Two employees told us they had no<br/>
&gt;&gt; such thing and told us if they were anywhere they'd be in the rubber<br/>
&gt;&gt; stamp section, but they had never heard about it.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; HOWEVER...we walked all through the store and finally found a little<br/>
&gt;&gt; section where this stuff was on the shelf.  It may be there, but they<br/>
&gt;&gt; may not understand what you're talking about, even if you use brand<br/>
&gt;&gt; names.  It certainly was far, far away from the commercial rubber<br/>
&gt;&gt; stamp and ink section and it was clear in the back of the store.  Sort<br/>
&gt;&gt; of near the framing section.  I think they just put that merchandise<br/>
&gt;&gt; way where they had a spare spot.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; My advice is to do some legwork (literally) in the store.  Walk around<br/>
&gt;&gt; and keep your eyes peeled. Chances are it is there stashed someplace,<br/>
&gt;&gt; and nowhere logical at that.  Store personnel may tell you they don't<br/>
&gt;&gt; have it, but if you hunt and seek, as you often do in general with<br/>
&gt;&gt; this sport, you may be rewarded!  <br/>

&gt;&gt; In reference to your comment:<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;  Two Michael's in  Massachusetts that I recently visited<br/>
&gt;&gt;  also did not carry ANY carving  materials.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; The Michael's in IL had no idea what I was talking about either - no<br/>
&gt;&gt; matter how I described what I was looking for.  After scouring the<br/>
&gt;&gt; aisles, I found the carving block myself.  Its possible that your<br/>
&gt;&gt; store doesnt carry it - its also possible that they dont know their<br/>
&gt;&gt; own inventory.<br/>

&gt;Perhaps not so far off as we might think.  After all,  if you have to go<br/>
&gt;looking all over the store for something,  you are going to walk past a lot<br/>
&gt;of other stuff that you may just buy on impulse.  Maybe there is a method to<br/>

&gt;Planted by Irishtinker<br/>
&gt;On 8/12/02<br/>
&gt;Rated Easy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;THE MAY BASKET<br/>
&gt;Box 2 of 3 of "When I Was a Girl In The Martin Box" By Orra Parker Phelps, an autobiography of a girl living in Coventry, CT <br/>
in the 1870's. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;From box 1 travel over the bridge on Parker Bridge Rd towards Coventry. At the stop Stay straight onto Bunker Hill Rd. At <br/>
the intersection on Bunker Hill and South Street you will see a triangle with a tree in the middle. Park on the South Street side. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;   "Early one evening in May, Father came from the barn where he'd been milking Dancer, the Jersey cow. There was a grin <br/>
on his face and a twinkle in his eye as he said "Wouldn't be surprised if Orra got a May basket. Saw Leon Lord and Kirk <br/>
Wallen sneaking down the road; guess I'll surprise them."<br/>
&gt;    I was thrilled. Never had I had a May basket. I begged Father not to do anything to the boys. "Oh Daddy, don't drive 'em <br/>
off. I do want a May basket so bad."<br/>
&gt;    Daddy laughed, "You'll get your basket, but I'll give 'em a scare."<br/>
&gt;    He went into the little front hall that had a narrow window on each side of the door. He sat down by one and motioned me <br/>
to look out the other. Presently we saw the two little boys creeping softly across the yard. They got to the door and one stood <br/>
with fist raised up to knock as soon as the other should hang the basket on the doorknob. The fist never had a chance to fall, <br/>
for the moment the basket was hung Father gave a tremendous knock on the inside. How those boys did scatter! Father <br/>
opened the door and handed me a paper box decorated with crimped streamers, it's handle a strip of cat stairs. There was <br/>
nothing in it but what it matter? I had a May basket I could tell the girls at school about." <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is a knot in the tree that has a piece of wood stuck in it. PLEASE WAIT UNTIL NO CARS ARE COMING to remove <br/>
and replace the box!!!!!!!! Remove the dead wood and find your May basket. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;Note: Look at the white farm house on the corner. Note the two long windows on each side of the doors. You can practically <br/>
see those two boys "creeping softly across the yard" and young Orra watching out the window.   <br/>

&gt;&gt; I've carved a lot on plumber's gasket. It is somewhat difficult to carve<br/>
&gt;&gt; (more like linoleum). The biggest downfall is that you would have to mount<br/>
&gt;&gt; it on some sort of block because you can't hold the gasket.<br/>

&gt;AC Moore also carries carving supplies and the speedball medium (at<br/>
&gt;least the ones in Dartmouth, MA and RI do).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have never found these materials to be near the rubber stamping stuff<br/>
&gt;in the stores, though.  Generally it is in with the linoleum cutting<br/>
&gt;supplies and/or calligraphy - since speedball is apparently most known<br/>
&gt;for their calligraphy supplies.<br/>

&gt;  THE MAY BASKET<br/>
&gt;  Box 2 of 3 of "When I Was a Girl In The Martin Box" By Orra Parker Phelps,<br/>
&gt;an autobiography of a girl living in Coventry, CT in the 1870's.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    From box 1 travel over the bridge on Parker Bridge Rd towards Coventry.<br/>
&gt;At the stop sign veer right onto Bunker Hill. At the intersection on Bunker<br/>
&gt;Hill and South Street you will see a triangle with a tree in the middle.<br/>
&gt;Park on the South Street side.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     "Early one evening in May, Father came from the barn where he'd been<br/>
&gt;milking Dancer, the Jersey cow. There was a grin on his face and a twinkle<br/>
&gt;in his eye as he said "Wouldn't be surprised if Orra got a May basket. Saw<br/>
&gt;Leon Lord and Kirk Wallen sneaking down the road; guess I'll surprise them."<br/>
&gt;      I was thrilled. Never had I had a May basket. I begged Father not to<br/>
&gt;do anything to the boys. "Oh Daddy, don't drive 'em off. I do want a May<br/>
&gt;basket so bad."<br/>
&gt;      Daddy laughed, "You'll get your basket, but I'll give 'em a scare."<br/>
&gt;      He went into the little front hall that had a narrow window on each<br/>
&gt;side of the door. He sat down by one and motioned me to look out the other.<br/>
&gt;Presently we saw the two little boys creeping softly across the yard. They<br/>
&gt;got to the door and one stood with fist raised up to knock as soon as the<br/>
&gt;other should hang the basket on the doorknob. The fist never had a chance to<br/>
&gt;fall, for the moment the basket was hung Father gave a tremendous knock on<br/>
&gt;the inside. How those boys did scatter! Father opened the door and handed me<br/>
&gt;a paper box decorated with crimped streamers, it's handle a strip of cat<br/>
&gt;stairs. There was nothing in it but what it matter? I had a May basket I<br/>
&gt;could tell the girls at school about."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  There is a knot in the tree that has a piece of wood stuck in it. PLEASE<br/>
&gt;WAIT UNTIL NO CARS ARE COMING to remove and replace the box!!!!!!!! Remove<br/>
&gt;the dead wood and find your May basket.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Note: Look at the white farm house on the corner. Note the two long<br/>
&gt;windows on each side of the doors. You can practically see those two boys<br/>
&gt;"creeping softly across the yard" and young Orra watching out the window.<br/>

&gt;The last time I purchased Speedy-Stamp at Michaels I complained to the Manager that someone had written all over the <br/>
surface . It was located on a shelf about 4 ft high and some folks tried out the various writing implements on it . She charged <br/>
me 1/3 price . I happily went home and cleaned it up with acetone. No , I was not the perp  that scribbled on it !   Don<br/>

&gt;Although Speedball does make nice stamps, so does<br/>
&gt;Magic Rub.  It's a nice eraser and relatively cheap...<br/>
&gt;that's right 79 cents.  They can be found in all the<br/>
&gt;Michael's stores.  You may want to give them a try.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Your Michael's must be smaller or have a limited<br/>

&gt;&gt; tools are in every<br/>
&gt;&gt; Michael's I've ever been in (I live in Michigan).<br/>
&gt;&gt; They are kept with fine <br/>
&gt;&gt; arts supplies, near the linoleum carving blocks (the<br/>
&gt;&gt; tools are the same<br/>
&gt;&gt; for soft block and lino). $2 is a most excellent<br/>
&gt;&gt; price for the pink stuff <br/>
&gt;&gt; -- retail is normally around $15 for that size.<br/>

Get a sheet of plumber's rubber gasket from Home Depot along with a bottle of contact cement.  Find some scrap wood and <br/>
cut blocks of wood to the size that you want your stamps.   Cut plumber's gasket to size and cement to block with contact <br/>
cement.  Sandpaper rubber surface ...put sandpaper on flat surface and rub block rubber on it until all of the gloss is off.<br/>
<br/>
Transfer your image to the block by whatever means you find will work for you.  Put block in  *freezer* compartment of the <br/>
refrigerator and freeze.  <br/>
<br/>
The rubber will now carve very well...nice detail.  when the block warms up, put it back in the freezer.  You can work on <br/>
several stamps at once and rotate them into and out of the freezer.<br/>
<br/>
I don't find that Pink Pearl erasers care any better when frozen; Mars plastic erasers may be a little better.<br/>
