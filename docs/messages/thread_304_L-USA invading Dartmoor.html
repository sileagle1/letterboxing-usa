Wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
I'm not crazy about any of the options listed on the list of stuff to vote<br/>
for--couldn't it be much looser?  Letterboxers interested in sending a<br/>
carving or stamp to be included in a walk could sign up or whatever and<br/>
then come up with an idea to execute on their own?<br/>
<br/>
Does Adrian know he's been volunteered yet?  ;oD<br/>
<br/>
(I'll finish reading the digest and maybe I'll find the answer)<br/>

open a bookshop.  It's tiny, but it grows now and then.  Come see!<br/>

We are a very creative group.  Limiting our efforts to any predetermined<br/>
concept would be a waste of our creative energies, I must admit.  So let's<br/>
just try and get an idea of how many people would be willing to send stamps to<br/>
Dartmoor.  (if there are too many, we may have to discuss how we're going to<br/>
choose, but for now let's just see what happens)<br/>

it.  I think for some things this will be a good idea though so<br/>
don't give up on it.  Also, the group may become so large at some<br/>
point that there will be no other practical way to assess its<br/>
current than by a poll.  We're still pretty small at about 55<br/>
subscribers and only about 10 to 15 of them regularly give input.<br/>
But that may change over the course of the next few months. Let's<br/>
wait and reevaluate it again in a little while.  I see this also<br/>
as a tool to merely gather information and to present it.  It is<br/>
not preeminent and we can always veto if it doesn't seem right <br/>
to a notable number of people.<br/>

send a stamp over should be open to all, not just any of the "firsts" -<br/>
so, we should get sense of how many might want to participate, to see if<br/>
Adrian or Graham is willing to deal with this number.<br/>

So, either Susan or I will do one...<br/>
