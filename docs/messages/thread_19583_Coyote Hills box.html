Since July 2002, so I'm no longer a newbie and far from being an <br/>
oldie. There are others that are given that honor. Although, I do <br/>
have a couple of gray hairs(thanks to Lizardbutt). I like to classify <br/>
myself as a juvenile boxer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Be careful, this can be an addicting sport. If you like heading into <br/>
the City, there are some fun letterboxes that have been placed in <br/>
areas with awesome rewards of S.F.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to meet you at the S.F. gathering.<br/>
