Arlington, Virginia went MIA as reported by a couple of visitors <br/>
(thanks).<br/>
<br/>
I visited and replaced the Old Boiler stamp today.  Since it is so <br/>
close to the Gulf Branch box and log and in such an exposed place, <br/>
rather than lose another box and log, I placed only the stamp with a <br/>
note in a zip lock bag.  I think that will be less likely to be <br/>
stolen.  Y'all can note in the Gulf Branch log whether you found the <br/>
Old Boiler stamp or not.  I also moved it's location by a foot to a <br/>
slightly better spot but the same directions still work.<br/>
<br/>
The woods were beautiful this morning.  After the drought and dust <br/>
the several days of rain made the woods lush and cool again.  The <br/>
waterfall was full and lively.<br/>
<br/>
It shocked me to see that the river was so high the old boiler itself <br/>
was under water!  Only five rivets like fingertips stuck up into the <br/>
current.  Be sure to notice the two foot wide vein of quartz that <br/>
runs away from the boiler and right up the cliffs.<br/>
<br/>
Watch for a new box the "Haunted Lost Ruins of Brandymore Castle".<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>
