<div>Well Carol, you and your band of merry 4Hers have 
done it again. The kids and I had a blast visiting all the animals, exhibits, 
events and the like this past weekend. We thought the letterboxing interwoven 
into the fair atmosphere was the best. What a great way to spend the day. We 
were even lucky enough to get our 50th!!! It was great seeing Dan, Melissa, 
Wanda and Pete again. And boy did that BBQ chicken dinner smell great. If we 
hadn't had plans for dinner, we would've stayed for that for sure. Your 
involvement in the 4H is to be commended to say the least. On another note, 
thanks, Allison now wants a pig as a pet. Great, just what I needed. I hope we 
can make it to the RI event in September. </div>
