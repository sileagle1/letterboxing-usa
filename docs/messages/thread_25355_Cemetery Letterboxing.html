                    <div class="plaintext-content">Cemeteries are good but the "respectful" part is really, really important.  More than in some other settings, you have to anticipate the results of boxers misunderstanding the clues and searching in the wrong places.<br/>
<br/>
You don't want to set something up so that it's reasonably possible for someone to wind up partially-dismantling a wall, thrashing through a memorial garden, or the like.<br/>
<br/>
Sensitivities are very high when it comes to cemeteries - whether the graves are new and thus the grief is fresh, or old and thus historic.<br/>
