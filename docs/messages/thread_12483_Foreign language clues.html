                    <div class="plaintext-content">Come to think of it, we found a letterbox here in the US with clues <br/>
written only in Polish.  I don't speak a lick of Polish and my <br/>
German, French and other foreign language skills didn't help a bit <br/>
in the translation.  Regardless, we were still able to translate it <br/>
and ultimately found the letterbox last October.  Talk about an <br/>
exciting event!!!  We were that much more excited to have found the <br/>
box, knowing how challenging it was in itself to simply translate <br/>
the clues (needless to say via cell phone from 2,000 miles away).<br/>
<br/>
Where there is a will, there is a way! IMHO, I don't see the <br/>
language issue as a problem at all.  After all, the internet <br/>
translators prove quite handy in these situations--even if you don't <br/>
have a Cyrillic/Hangul/Hanja/etc. keyboard and are too lazy to go <br/>
the ASCII route. ;)  Also, if you check many of the personal foreign <br/>
letterboxing sites, (Germany, Netherlands, etc.) their clues are <br/>
written primarily in English and then also translated into their <br/>
native languages when they opted to do so.  Most of these <br/>
letterboxers started the hobby while visiting Dartmoor and were <br/>
inspired to bring it to their own countries.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I hear where you're coming from.  A language other than English <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; the US is one thing.  I think if you're going to place a letterbox <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; some foreign country, it should be accesible to the people that <br/>
live <br/>
&gt; there.  Otherwise it really seems to me that we are just leaving <br/>
