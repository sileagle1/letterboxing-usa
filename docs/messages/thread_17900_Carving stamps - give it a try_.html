                    <div class="plaintext-content">With all the new letterboxers joining this site (including me) and <br/>
with the recent discussion about store-bought stamps...<br/>
<br/>
I have NO objection to store-bought stamps.  But if you're just <br/>
afraid or nervous to try your hand at carving, don't be!<br/>
<br/>
It's a lot easier than it looks.  Visit the links on the LbNA site <br/>
to various carving tutorials and tips.  Get yourself a Speedball <br/>
carving tool and go for it.<br/>
<br/>
My first 3 stamps were gouged out (and I mean that the negative way) <br/>
with woodcarving tools.  Two of them are my sig stamps, large and <br/>
small versions.  The third one is in the "Fleur de Lis Pizza" <br/>
letterbox.  Some who find that one may think it stinks, but I think <br/>
it's OK for an early effort.<br/>
<br/>
Once I got the Speedball tools, things improved fast. I recently <br/>
finished a 1.5 by 1.5 inch carving of a cool museum logo which <br/>
includes words.  It came out great!  I wouldn't have believed I <br/>
could do that 3 months ago.<br/>
<br/>
Start with a reverse carving, where you just carve the outline and <br/>
you're done.  The bigger the image, the easier it is to carve.  <br/>
You'll be surprised how good even that will look.  I still do some <br/>
reverse carvings, especially on tiny stamps.<br/>
<br/>
As you get better, you'll be able to handle smaller things.  And <br/>
regular carvings where you carve away material instead of just <br/>
carving around an outline.  Save the letter carving until you get a <br/>
little experience under your belt.<br/>
<br/>
My sister recently carved her first stamp - a signature stamp.  She <br/>
was very frustrated while she was working on it.  I kept telling her <br/>
to calm down, that it was looking good.  I made her make impressions <br/>
along the way so she could see how it was shaping up.  When it was <br/>
done, she was surprised.  It'a a bowling ball knocking down 3 pins - <br/>
pretty ambitious for a first-time carving in my opinion - and it <br/>
came out GREAT!  I think her first is equal to my 10th or 12th <br/>
effort.<br/>
<br/>
Key thing is not to quit, keep going.  Keep carving no matter how <br/>
crummy you think it looks, until you've carved it all.  And then <br/>
carve another.  And another.<br/>
<br/>
What do you have to lose?  The tools cost less than $10.  If, after <br/>
you've carved about 30 stamps, you still think they're awful then <br/>
you have my permission to give up. <grin>  But that WON'T happen!  <br/>
You'll do fine - maybe not Rembrandt, but you'll surprise yourself.<br/>
<br/>
And, no, I don't draw, paint, sculpt, or even do any crafty things - <br/>
until now with the eraser carving.  So I was pure, untested, no-<br/>
talent go-out-on-a-limb material.  And, hey - I'm gettin' pretty <br/>
darn good!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with you. I had to carve some linoleum in my high school art <br/>
class about 12 years ago. That was my first and only experience with <br/>
carving until now.  I just made my first letterboxing stamp<br/>
(personal) using the speedball tools and a chunk of SpeddyCut.  It <br/>
came out great!  My only advice to a new carver would be to go slow <br/>
and give yourself room for error.  If you are going to leave a thin <br/>
line to be stamped, carve it thick and then shave it to the thinness <br/>
you desire.  <br/>
<br/>
I can't wait to make more.<br/>

really aggravating to have it go missing again.   Grrrr.   Now I have to decide <br/>
if it's worth it to re-hide this one, or if I should just move on to another <br/>
one somewhere else.<br/>

That's what I did the first time it went missing.   Same nature trail, but <br/>
different section.   I'm wondering if I should just find a completely different <br/>
area.   Hate to, because this little nature trail is perfect (other than <br/>
swallowing boxes, of course!)<br/>
