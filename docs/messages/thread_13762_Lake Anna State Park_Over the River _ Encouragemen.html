                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was recently notified by a letterboxer that the "Encouragement" <br/>
hitchhiker I had left with the Over the River box in Lake Anna State <br/>
Park in VA was turned into a "Bonus Box" because someone thought it <br/>
wasn't a real hitchhiker (or something like that).<br/>
<br/>
I'm quite dismayed that someone took it upon himself/herself to <br/>
decide the fate of my hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
We drove all the way from CT to Atlanta and we stopped at Lake Anna <br/>
solely for the purpose of finding it's two boxes and leaving a <br/>
hitchhiker from CT.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this letterboxer thought it odd that it was in a box of it's <br/>
own, but up here in the northeast, I've ran across many that were in <br/>
their own container and did not think twice about giving it it's own <br/>
travelling home, both for its safety and for convenience of someone <br/>
moving it around.<br/>
<br/>
Supposedly somewhere in the Over the River box there are directions <br/>
on how to find the hitchhiker. (must be in the logbook??)<br/>
If anyone happens upon the box, would you please take it out of the <br/>
park and start it on it's hitchhiker journey.<br/>
I may not be able to travel out of my corner of CT much, but it gives <br/>
me great joy to know that something else that I love can <br/>
travel...anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
To whoever thought it best to make it a bonus box, no hard feelings, <br/>
but I really would love to see it get out and about.<br/>
<br/>
with many thanks,<br/>
Kristen<br/>
