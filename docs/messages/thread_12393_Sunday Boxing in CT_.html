with Lobsta Lady, Moonstone Baby and Butterfly to go boxing today, since <br/>
yesterday was such a washout (literally!)!<br/>
<br/>
While I was in church this morning (see who the REALLY GOOD PERSON WAS?????), <br/>
Lobsta, Moonstone and Butterfly were able to find the Nehantic State Forest <br/>
(DEP) and Walden Preserve boxes with no problem.  They were all in good <br/>
condition from what I've been told (see??? I told you I was in church!).<br/>
<br/>
We then met up and tackled the first two boxes of Seven Falls in <br/>
Higganum/Middletown, since the first is said to be missing.  Both boxes had <br/>
water in them and the first box really needs a new container.  We also <br/>
planted a new box somewhere out in the wild blue yonder called Soaring (get <br/>
the pun???).<br/>
<br/>
We then headed out to Hammonassett State Park to find Ancient Fish, <br/>
Hammonassett Men and Hammonasett Beach boxes.  The ones with the word <br/>
Hammonassett in them were all in good condition, however, as I previously <br/>
reported, Ancient Fish was attacked by the killer raccoons.  We pulled the <br/>
box and hope to have it back to judi ASAP for repairs.  While out finding <br/>
Maine Man (or just stamping into it) we met and exchanged with the Cravens <br/>
from my neck of the woods (or suburbia if you want to be technical).  It was <br/>
nice to meet such new and enthusiastic letterboxers!  I'm hoping that they <br/>
will be able to make it to the Gerbil (or is it a Hamster) Funeral on the <br/>
17th, so they can get LOTS of exchanges!  They're really new at this, so it <br/>
would be great if they could boost their X count!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was a great day of boxing!  Thanks to all, especially Moonstone <br/>
Baby for driving all the way from RI to our neck of suburbia!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting to All!<br/>

(who's term paper is ALMOST DONE!  When done, she can get serious with this <br/>
sport called LETTERBOXING!  Woo Hoo!  1000 here I come!)<br/>
