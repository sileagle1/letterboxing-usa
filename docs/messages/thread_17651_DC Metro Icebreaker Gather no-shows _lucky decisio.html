                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I'm sorry that we missed it and glad that you would have been <br/>
understanding of my still nearly-empty notebook.  Sounds like just what <br/>
I'd been hoping for, but I panicked at the last minute.  :-&lt;  It's a <br/>
good thing we didn't go, though!  Unbeknownst to us at the time I wrote <br/>
my message, our littler one (who turns 2 a month from today) had <br/>
overindulged herself before we awoke with at least a dozen dried <br/>
apricots.  Starting around 11:30 until late afternoon, she...  well, she <br/>
wouldn't eat anything else until nearly dinnertime and things were <br/>
pretty ugly all day.  Hate to think what would have happened to the car <br/>
&amp; mall had we come to join you.  LOL.  But OK, I'll try not to feel <br/>
inadequate ;-&gt; about my lazy searching - I should have known you guys <br/>
better.  This isn't high school any more.  Definitely hope to see you in <br/>
the spring (even if I still haven't gotten another stamp by then).<br/>
