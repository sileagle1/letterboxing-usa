you that on May 17, 2003 @ Hop Brook Lake in Middlebury will be the <br/>
letterboxing social event of the season...or at least for the month of May. <br/>
There is swimming and fishing at at least 10 letterboxes there even as we <br/>
speak.<br/>
I also got a handy dandy official permit to place boxes at the park!!<br/>
We have rented the pavillion with electricity and have planned many great <br/>
surprises!! This event is to commemorate poor Gerbil in the gold foil box <br/>
who had been buried on top of my Cemetary Search box in Naugatuck.<br/>
Anyway, we are planning a really cool raffle you enter as you stamp the <br/>
event book. I might be raffling off a autographed photo of me and Governor <br/>
Rowland.....of course it's MY autograph...please don't fight, I'll sign <br/>
more!! AND a hitch hiker exchange. Either bring a HH you have carved or one <br/>
you have found along the way place it in a specially designated basket and <br/>
take a new one home with you to release.<br/>
<br/>
Bring food to share and we will provide the plates, come hungry for food, <br/>
fun and fellowship!!<br/>
I hope to put faces to some of my stamps!!<br/>
