<br/>
     Sue and I just got back late this afternoon from our VT vacation <br/>
and even had time to do some letterboxing in NH.<br/>
<br/>
     These are the following boxes we found, all in great shape:<br/>
<br/>
Honey Hill Letterboxes, Swanzey, NH 6/02/03<br/>
Franklin Pearce Letterbox, Hillsborough, NH 6/02/03<br/>
Fuller Public Library, Hillsborough, NH 6/02/03<br/>
Fox Forest, Hillsborough, NH 6/02/03<br/>
Deering Overlook, Deering, NH 6/02/03<br/>
Deering Public Library, Deering, NH 6/02/03<br/>
Lovely Weed, Hillsborough, NH 6/02/03<br/>
Man in Stone, Dorset, VT 6/04/03<br/>
<br/>
     The mosquitos and no-see-ums were wild with all of the rain the <br/>
first weekend of our vacation - felt like we were in the Florida Keys <br/>
or the Everglades with all of the insects!!<br/>
<br/>
     RTRW: Great stamps and nice locations for the above boxes that <br/>
are yours - almost missed the Deering Library! And the bugs prevented <br/>
us from finding your Town Pound box - we searched for about 15 <br/>
minutes and had to leave. We will try this again in the fall! Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
     I will add some commentary tomorrow night to our website, as <br/>
well as a few new CT Gerbil Photos and some personal boxing pictures <br/>
that came in the mail while we were away. <br/>
<br/>
     Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
