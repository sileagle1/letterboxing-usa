                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking it might be about time for another Letterboxing gathering<br/>
in the Portland area.  It's been a while.  We had a wonderful gathering<br/>
in Portland in August 2002 at Upper MacLeay Park organized and hosted by<br/>
Funhog, which was a blast.  <br/>
<br/>
In November 2002 Bethany, a.k.a. Dvntrcker or however she spells it,<br/>
hosted an event that exceeded expectation, food, and letterboxing fun in<br/>
the Olympia/Tacoma area!!!  (South Sound Chili is outstanding and easy,<br/>
by the way!)  Lots of great letterboxers showed up for that and God<br/>
blessed us with a beautiful day and a wonderful view of Mt. Rainier.<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking Oxbow Park in the Gresham/Boring area might be a good place<br/>
to host.  It does cost an admission fee of $3 per car, though, unless<br/>
you have a Metro Parks pass, and if that is cost-prohibitive I'd be<br/>
willing to take other suggestions.  There are two letterboxes there<br/>
already -- Cara's Oxbow Letterbox #1 -- (#2 has been missing forever)<br/>
and Funhog's Riverbend Box.  It's a large and wonderful park that would<br/>
have lots of good hiding of letterbox opportunities.  It is right on the<br/>
Sandy River, too, for those who enjoy canoeing, kayaking, innertubing or<br/>
swimming.<br/>
<br/>
I'd appreciate input on what you think of the idea and appropriate dates<br/>
for such an event.  The end of July is out for me, otherwise, I'm open<br/>
to all ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>

Another possible location (one that would be free) is the Hopkins Memorial <br/>
Tree Farm near Oregon City.  Don't picture knee-high monoculture--this is a <br/>
very nice woods that could accomodate many boxes, has an outdoor picnic <br/>
shelter for the boxers, and *might* be available on a certain day only--or <br/>
mostly--to letterboxers (I would have to check that last bit with my husband, <br/>
who works there--but he's sensibly sleeping right now.  What the heck are the <br/>
rest of you doing up this late?????).  <br/>

&gt; Hello one and all! I am the nakedone living the wonderful life in<br/>
&gt; Portland. I have been completely enraptured by the idea of<br/>
&gt; letterboxing now that I know of it. A friend showed me the site while<br/>
&gt; we got ready to go up Dog Mountain on a hike. We found the letterbox<br/>
&gt; and I have been hooked since!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was hoping to see if there were others involved in the Portland<br/>
&gt; area, and was rewarded that this was so by finding this group and<br/>
&gt; some local names in the few letterboxes I've found in the Greater<br/>
&gt; Portland area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Despite being new to this, I'm dedicated completely to it as I've<br/>
&gt; been loving hiking for some years now. However, adding a<br/>
&gt; little "treaure hunt" makes it all the better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If there's a gathering, let me know and I'll be there!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope to hear from you soon!<br/>
