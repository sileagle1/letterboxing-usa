Well, after finding more that 100 boxes without a H.H. in sight, along came
my birthday month and the Letterboxing Gods smiled on me. I am reporting
 Six H.H. found,  not by me alone~~ but with friends.<br/>
<u>Mighty Mouse </u> on opening Day at the Inn.!! <br/>
<u>The Great Pumpkin</u> found resting at The Inn of the Beginning as we
check in [ and  already picked up ]-<br/>
<u>The Wood Duck</u> , Woodie. found at Marathon Man in Niantic Ct.<br/>
<u>Costa Rica or Bust</u>  pick up while at the Ma gather on Jan 18 , living
with The  Fern .<br/>
<u>Bastille Day</u>  found in my Birthday Box at Rocky Neck this morning
, Jan 19, planted by Music Woman [Thanks]<br/>
We checked in at the Inn as we went by and exchanged  [?] and picked up <u>Thumbs
Up</u>. It was fun to see where it has traveled as last year on Feb. 12, 
I found it while letterboxing with Leader of the Pack at State Symbals. <br/>
This has been a fun month !! I love the rush of  finding a box and when there
is a H.H. it is a time to really give a yell.<br/>
