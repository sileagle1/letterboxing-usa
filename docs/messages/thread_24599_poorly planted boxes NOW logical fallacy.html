Sorry Randy but I don't agree. This logical fallacy argument is over used and does not <br/>
negate an argument in all circumstances. It is impossible to prove nonexistence of <br/>
something that has never been proven to exist (God, or something infinite or in an infinite <br/>
system) however, we prove the nonexistence of known (proven to exist) entities in finite <br/>
systems everyday. A doctor can prove that you don't have a tumor in your fibula. Or a <br/>
bomb squad that there's no bomb in a building. Or a child that there are no tater tots on <br/>
their plate.<br/>
<br/>
It's all probabilities (of course our very atoms are probabilities) but given a finite system it <br/>
is only a function of time and resources to prove that a known entity is or is not present in <br/>
that system. If a letterbox clue says that a letterbox is within a certain area and you have <br/>
correctly interpreted the language and searched in an adequately large area you can state <br/>
with some degree of certainty that the box is or is not present. You can easily have 100% <br/>
certainty that it is present, it would require significant resources and time to state with <br/>
100% certainty that it is not present but it can be done, ergo, no logical fallacy. The <br/>
accusation of logical fallacy as a device to negate an argument is often misused (creating <br/>
it's own logical fallacy). Unless you are going to argue that the existence of such a thing as <br/>
a letterbox is in question then I don't see a logical fallacy nor do I see a flaw in the <br/>
assertion that one can state with a reasonable degree of certainty that a given letterbox is <br/>
likely to be missing.<br/>
<br/>
You cannot state that the argument that a letterbox is missing is always a logical fallacy <br/>
and thereby negate the argument and conclude that it is impossible to state that any <br/>
letterbox is missing.<br/>

&gt; but given a finite system it is only a function of time and resources <br/>
 &gt; to prove that a known entity is or is not present in that system. If<br/>
 &gt; a letterbox clue says that a letterbox is within a certain area and<br/>
 &gt; you have correctly interpreted the language and searched in an<br/>
 &gt; adequately large area you can state with some degree of certainty<br/>
 &gt; that the box is or is not present. You can easily have 100%<br/>
&gt; certainty that it is present, it would require significant resources <br/>
 &gt; and time to state with  100% certainty that it is not present but it<br/>
 &gt; can be done, ergo, no logical fallacy.<br/>
<br/>
Rebuttal to the rebuttal:<br/>
<br/>
Summary: I find the rebuttal simply pushes the problem to another<br/>
assumption of existance.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there are alot of "ifs" in the above quoted text.  I'll grant<br/>
the assumption that it is a finite system, even tho I don't necessarily<br/>
believe it, because it doesn't matter.<br/>
<br/>
The assumption that "you have correctly interpreted the language" is a<br/>
big assumption to swallow, as that is the crux of the original argument.<br/>
I've had people "correctly interpret the language", tell me the box<br/>
is missing, describe the area, etc, and be off by counties, towns, or<br/>
states.  I also find "with some degree of certainty", which your<br/>
rebuttal hinges on in some sense, categorically different than<br/>
"safely assume", which is what I was responding to.  Perhaps hair<br/>
splitting, but I would not have responded to "with some degree of<br/>
certainty" (because, quite frankly, I find the phrase a bit vacuous).<br/>
But, this doesn't matter that much either in my rebuttal.  While<br/>
appropriate to the question of letterboxing and interpreting clues,<br/>
it is not all that rhetorically interesting (at least to me).<br/>
<br/>
The the big assumption that fails on closer inspection is: "it<br/>
would require significant resources and time to state with 100%<br/>
certainty that it is not present but it can be done, ergo, no<br/>
logical fallacy."<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the Laplacian view of physics, which asserts that the<br/>
universe is a finite, determinate system, and that if you knew the<br/>
positions and velocities of all the particles in the universe, you<br/>
can calculate what it will look like 100 years from now.  In theory,<br/>
true, but in practice false, as, from the point of view of information<br/>
theory, it is not possible to perform the calculations (the universe<br/>
would die of heat death well before the calculations get to square<br/>
one, and/or doesn't have enough EM to build and program the computing<br/>
equipment -- AFAIK, this argument isn't controversial).  And its not<br/>
my point to debate whether Laplace was right (he was writing before<br/>
quantum theory was developed, for example, forgetting any metaphysical<br/>
arguments); the point is that there is a big difference between "in<br/>
theory knowable", and "in practice knowable".<br/>
<br/>
I claim the same principle causes the above assumption, on which<br/>
your rebuttal depends, to also fail.  To wit "but it can be done".<br/>
No proof is offered that "it can be done", and, as I alluded to,<br/>
I counterclaim that it is too complex to be done, regardless of<br/>
how much free energy there is to do it.  To wit, I specifically<br/>
claim that there is not enough free energy within the letterboxing<br/>
community to search a sufficiently complex area to prove beyond a<br/>
shadow of a doubt that the box is missing.  (And I guess we could<br/>
argue bounds, whether the argument should be couched within the<br/>
universe of letterboxing free energy or universal free energy; I<br/>
don't think it matters for my rebuttal to work, nor do I think it<br/>
is interesting).<br/>
<br/>
Your assumption that there is enough free energy to do it is akin<br/>
to assuming there is enough free energy to search every crevice<br/>
of existence for God, thus rebutting the ontological argument<br/>
without actually demonstrating the existence of said free energy;<br/>
that is, without actually doing it.  That just pushes the problem<br/>
of existence to something else, unfortunately, and, at the end of<br/>
the day, does become a faith argument.<br/>

Rebuttal to the rebuttal to the rebuttal:<br/>
<br/>
Ok, let's split some hairs. We'll probably end in an argument about semantics by parsing <br/>
every statement but I'm game.<br/>
<br/>
You made the broad generalization that "it is not possible to prove non-existence, only <br/>
existence". You then applied this to a specific argument about a specific entity in a finite <br/>
system. I stand by my assertion that there are many instances in which we prove <br/>
nonexistence and further that we can in many (NB: I said many not all) instances do so <br/>
with little expenditure of energy. I was careful to clarify that there are instances in which <br/>
we cannot prove nonexistence such as proving that something is nonexistent in an infinite <br/>
system or proving something is nonexistent which is neither tangible nor proven a priori <br/>
to exist in any form. Getting back to the point I was making, this negation by accusation of <br/>
logical fallacy is overused and only applies in special circumstances...and not in this one. <br/>
All non-virtual letterboxes are tangible and most if not all are limited to the the upper 100 <br/>
yards of the earth's crust and lower 5000 feet of it's atmosphere. It is then a matter of the <br/>
specificity of the clue and the limitations of language. Regardless of how you feel about <br/>
language we both must accept  its limitations because letterbox clues must be <br/>
communicated and that requires some form of language and all language systems, in-fact <br/>
any communications, have inherent limitations. (Want to debate the problem of authorial <br/>
intent? That's a big one when it comes to letterbox clues ain't it) <br/>
<br/>
If I misunderstood you and you meant that you cannot prove actual existence of some <br/>
entity in all instances of that entity (the nature of existence itself) then I withdraw but I <br/>
believe that everyone here can accept the existence of letterboxes. From there it is only a <br/>
matter of probability. Here again you're trying to negate my argument with broad <br/>
statements. You state in essence that because you can conceive of a letterbox about <br/>
whose whereabouts so little is known that it would require an impractical amount of <br/>
energy to locate that you have negated my argument, not so.<br/>
<br/>
The expenditure of energy to prove that something agreed to be tangible does not exist is <br/>
determined by the amount of energy with in the finite system that contains it or which is <br/>
claimed to contain it. If the clues or language are vague then the degree of certainty with <br/>
which you can state that it is missing, after expending a reasonable amount of energy <br/>
searching, decreases; I grant you that, it doesn't drop to zero however. Sure there are <br/>
limits of practicality (Who wouldn't consume all the energy on earth looking for a <br/>
Mapsurfer box) but practical is not actual; the former only approaches zero the later <br/>
reaches zero. Somewhere around the midpoint between the clue that says 'this letterbox is <br/>
at the following GPS coordinates' and the one that says 'this letterbox is somewhere on <br/>
earth' those limits of practicality are exceeded but I think we could agree that most boxes <br/>
are in the range if higher specificity.<br/>
<br/>
Without debating the numbers and bounds I think it is fair to state that it is likely or <br/>
probably or safe to assume (ack language again) that a given letterbox is missing and if <br/>
someone says so about one of mine I will check. I will not assume however that no one can <br/>
prove nonexistence therefor no one can state that my letterbox is missing. Here is where <br/>
theory meets practicality. I will go check and if needed replace my missing box you seem <br/>
to be saying that you, realizing that no one can prove nonexistence, would stay <br/>
comfortably at home confident of your interlocutors false logic.<br/>
