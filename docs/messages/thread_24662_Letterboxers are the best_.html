there who make this pastime so great.  <br/>
<br/>
I planted for the first time this summer, and included a little <br/>
surprise for finders to enjoy while stamping in.  I didn't know if it <br/>
was reasonable to expect that the little extra something I put in my <br/>
l'box would still be there after multiple finders, but upon replacing <br/>
the full logbook last week, the "something extra" that I put in was <br/>
still there.  I am quite pleased to find so many people in a global <br/>
pasttime who are so considerate and respectful of each other.  So a <br/>
big "thank you" to those of you who rehide with care, who leave such <br/>
nice comments in logbooks, and who make this such an enjoyable pasttime!<br/>
