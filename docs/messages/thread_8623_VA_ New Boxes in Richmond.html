<br/>
Two new letterboxes were placed on October 21, 2002, in Richmond, <br/>
Virginia at Three Lakes Park by mlgainey. Three Lakes Park is in <br/>
Henrico County. The closest city is Richmond.<br/>
<br/>
Admission is free. There is a charming aquarium in the park and you <br/>
can fish from one of the lakes. There is a nice playground area, too.<br/>
<br/>
Park as close as you can to the aquarium.<br/>
<br/>
Take the paved path behind the aquarium past the Enabling Garden.<br/>
<br/>
The paved path eventually becomes a gravel path.<br/>
<br/>
Cross the bridge after the "Uneven Footpath" sign.<br/>
<br/>
Take the right fork.<br/>
<br/>
The Heron Box is under the third bridge that you cross from where you <br/>
began on the paved path near the aquarium. It contains a pencil. <br/>
Please rehide completely from view.<br/>
<br/>
Get back on the path going in the opposite direction from whence you <br/>
came.<br/>
<br/>
Take the left fork.<br/>
<br/>
Take the trail around the lakes. Watch out for sections covered in <br/>
tree roots.<br/>
<br/>
Take the right fork.<br/>
<br/>
At the "No Fishing on This Lake" sign, go right.<br/>
<br/>
Take the right fork through the wooded area at another "No Fishing on <br/>
This Lake" sign.<br/>
<br/>
At the top of the hill, go left on the gravel path.<br/>
<br/>
Go right on the paved path.<br/>
<br/>
Take the gravel path to your left.<br/>
<br/>
The Turtle Box is on your left very shortly after the fishing pier.<br/>
It <br/>
is in a cavity in a thin pine tree. It is a microbox and does not <br/>
contain a pencil. Please rehide completely from view.<br/>
<br/>
To get back to your car, retrace your steps back to the paved path. <br/>
Continue on the paved path to the parking lot.<br/>
