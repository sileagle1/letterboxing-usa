 Went back and read the orignal post. Not to rain on Amber's parade too much but here is my <br/>
 question. How does this involve new people in boxing? I f anyone needs "prizes" other than <br/>
 the hike and the box maybe they should geo-cache. <br/>
 Taking a picture of them holding the t-shirt? Why not just take a picture of them holding the <br/>
 box? <br/>
 Now the question of ink. Have you stamped on fabric before? Not as easy as one would think. <br/>
 A tiny bit of moisture with a watercolor marker or dye ink pad and the shirt would become a <br/>
 tie-dye mess.<br/>
 OK, the horse is dead and the lemur has been flung.<br/>

In reference to Chicago area boxers.  I don't know how many of 'em, if any,<br/>
read this list, but I could easily give ya a dozen or more Chicago boxers<br/>
that might've jumped at figuring out a way to do it.  There are a lot of<br/>
things going on behind the scenes here that arguably might not be called<br/>
letterboxing.  It's been dubbed Twu Letterboxing With a Twist. A group just<br/>
finished up a letterboxing hunt New Year's Eve.<br/>
