I want to carve a new signature stamp and send it somewhere to get it made<br/>
into a self-inking stamp I can carry in my pocket. Does anyone know of a<br/>
company that will do that? I want it like an address stamp I have for<br/>
envelopes - you press down on the top and the stamp (which is normally<br/>
inside) flips down and stamps onto the envelope, then goes back up inside<br/>
the stamp.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have done just that.  I pulled out the "Sold" stamp that was inside the biggest stamper I could find, and I used that as a "go-by" for the size of stamp I wanted to carve.  Then I stuck my stamp inside where the "Sold" stamp was, the base was still sticky.  I have used this for years now, perfectly wonderful for events.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to those of you who replied - I think I'll go with buying the biggest self-inker I can find and replacing the stamp.  I e-mailed the places you suggested to find out if they could make me up something if I sent it in, but short of that I think I'll go with replacing something with my own carving.  Thanks!<br/>
