Hi Chuck-<br/>
Ginger is VERY close....I found her in MA on Wednesday...She is <br/>
visiting with MY Molly (I have a yellow lab named Molly) right now <br/>
and is eager to meet up with you and your Molly. I won't have time to <br/>
drop her off this weekend but I promise to plant her close to you.<br/>
