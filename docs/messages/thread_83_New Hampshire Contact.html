Hi Danielle,<br/>
<br/>
You happen to live in an area that is good for letterboxing.<br/>
Vermont has 8 or 10 letterboxes and New Hampshire has <br/>
at least one other letterbox enthusiast (Nisa).  Nisa's e-mail<br/>
address is mailto:teapot@teapot.mv.com<br/>
<br/>
If you want to see the spread for Vermont's letterboxes<br/>
go to the web page at http://www.pclink.com/elf/<br/>
and click on the State of Vermont on the right-hand U.S. map.<br/>
Vermont's contact person (Erik &amp; Susan Davis) happen to be<br/>
cofounders with me of Letterbox USA.  Their e-mail address<br/>
is mailto:davisarc@wcvt.com<br/>
<br/>
Welcome aboard.  Their is a lot of useful information for you<br/>
at the page mentioned above.  My hope is that each person who<br/>
joins will submit one or two letterboxes and then eventually<br/>
we will all have something to search for.  The long-term goal<br/>
of course is to have a variety of letterboxes to search for<br/>
all over the country.  Realistically, it may be a few years<br/>
before we reach that point.  We started this last April and<br/>
already there are abouit 45 letterboxes in 10 different states.<br/>
<br/>
There is no shortage of enthusiasm and willingness to help out.<br/>
We have a lot of nice people in our group who contribute their<br/>
ideas and resources.  If you have any questions don't hesitate<br/>
to ask any of us.  We are all willing to help.<br/>
<br/>
Hint:  Try the Group Mail option at the page mentioned above.<br/>
