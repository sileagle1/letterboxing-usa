I just wanted to say that my husband, my sister-in-law and her <br/>
husband (Wanda and Pete) did Little Dam today for the first time <br/>
since that section of the trail was relocated.  We had a great <br/>
chuckle when we got to the Sunny Outcrop and read your description of <br/>
taking care climbing down.  <br/>
<br/>
This was the site almost ten years ago to the day that my mother-in-<br/>
law broke her ankle.  We were hiking with my mother-in-law's hiking <br/>
group (full of 60 and 70 year olds) when it happened.  Wanda ran for <br/>
help while we waited and waited and waited.  When we could hear the <br/>
rescue vehicles heading off passed us and going to Lantern Hill we <br/>
decided to rig up a stretcher to carry her out.  We finally got to <br/>
the corn field when they found the right spot.  We think that maybe <br/>
you should reconsider calling it Broken Ankle...<br/>

PS My mother-in-law is in her 70's and still with her hiking group.<br/>
