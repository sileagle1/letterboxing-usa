                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many thanks to those who enthusiastically recommended the birdhouses <br/>
of Needham, MA.  We don't expect to get back here soon so with all <br/>
the encouragement we attempted it in the oncoming dark anyway.  And <br/>
it got darker and darker.  We couldn't believe what we were finding, <br/>
all the little things, so many of them leading us deeper and deeper <br/>
in to the woods and Dark.  But such an incredible surprise at the <br/>
end.  We wish we'd had a match for the lantern. Many thanks for this <br/>
one to the birdhouse RR'ers.  We'll be back.<br/>
<br/>
We found Psychomommy in Salem, MA!  Imagine our surprise to open up <br/>
the Salem letterbox and find the hitchhiker we carried around VA for <br/>
a while, Psychomommy's Caveat. We were almost the last people to sign <br/>
into this hitchhiker before it came north.  We now will try to find a <br/>
place to leave Caveat on Cape Cod before we head home south.  I've <br/>
only found a couple of HH's in the wild.  Wouldn't you know that two <br/>
of them would be the same one and 900 miles apart.  Knight's of <br/>
Colombo, did you leave this one up here?<br/>
<br/>
We started seeing Wanda and Pete's stamps in letterboxes on Cape Cod <br/>
just before Christmas.  They had been there just the day before.  If <br/>
only we'd arranged to meet.  Then at the next letterbox they had been <br/>
there that same day!  I was just telling Night Owl we should, "Look <br/>
for a maroon Outback. ..." when, "There it goes."  They passed us and <br/>
we followed in the car, jumping out when they stopped at the next <br/>
letterbox site, and surprising them.  We last saw Wanda in VA and <br/>
were really happy to see her again and to meet Pete.  We had a great <br/>
afternoon letterboxing together and they were nice enough to visit <br/>
Night Owl's new Bird on a Wing Island letterbox.  Hope to see y'all <br/>
again soon.<br/>

you would come across him twice at such a distance? I would claim him <br/>
twice since he was found in a new resting place. Thanks for the <br/>
update.<br/>
