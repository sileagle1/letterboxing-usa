                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is an opinion on the imposition of more moderation as the result <br/>
of a few loud and/or obnoxious folks.<br/>
<br/>
Some folks have said things along the lines of 'ruining it for <br/>
everyone.' - I hope it was not your intention, but, please don't <br/>
speak for me or as a majority representative.  Of the 1,454 members <br/>
on the list I can't be the only one to not have been disenchanted by <br/>
the list discussions.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't make sense to me to put the whole class under heavy guard <br/>
because 'Johnny' was acting out.<br/>
<br/>
Ignore, Warn or punish by Boot the offenders, not those who play <br/>
nice.  And be very clear on what offenses are punishable by boot.<br/>
How many demerits before I'm booted?  If I've not offended the <br/>
moderators but someone in Omaha, does it still count as a demerit? <br/>
How can I earn back demerit credits?<br/>
<br/>
Granted, being moderated shouldn't effect my posting at all because <br/>
it's extremely rare that I'm going to slam someone publicly.  It just <br/>
sticks in my craw that I'M being moderated.<br/>
<br/>
Where is the line drawn?  How can I speak and NOT offend ONE of the <br/>
1,454 members?  AND heaven forfend if THAT someone is a squeaky wheel.<br/>
<br/>
I was once taken aback by the inconsistency of list moderation when <br/>
someone put out a post looking for adj. adj. noun letterboxers <br/>
(Msg#30634) - and many chimed in to say that person's post was <br/>
inappropriate.<br/>
<br/>
Later, (Msg #32658) someone else was looking for adj. adj. noun <br/>
letterboxers, and was NOT met with the same "this is inappropriate" <br/>
response.<br/>
<br/>
Which would you deem inappropriate?  Irish or Gay? Pagan or Step-<br/>
Dancer?<br/>
<br/>
#31275 Newbie asked for clarification of what IS acceptable to post.<br/>
<br/>
#32343 Writer said they almost didn't plant boxes because of the <br/>
negative attitude they found on the list.<br/>
<br/>
#14484 Writer became the target of a poll vote - "Should the <br/>
initiator (and all of his aliases) of message 14484 (Newbies make me <br/>
want to vomit!) be banned?"<br/>
<br/>
My reaction to all of this: Let every person be quick to listen, slow <br/>
to speak, slow to become angry.  Do what you will without harming <br/>
others.  Laissez Faire moderation and Laissez Faire attitudes.  <br/>
