beginning to think that it was either a figment of her imagination <br/>
or a cruel joke she played on the LB community. But the third time <br/>
being the charm, I can now verify that it indeed exists though it is <br/>
a bit lonely. I understand I'm not the only other person who <br/>
couldn't find it. I encourage eveyone to make a journey out to visit <br/>
it. If you don't find it at least you'll have the consolation of a <br/>
raging headache and recurring nightmares about it!<br/>
