<div>My son and I spent the day in El Dorado Park in 
Long Beach CA tracking down the El Dorado series.  We found 4 and missed 
3.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p>#1 The El Dorado Nature Center Letterbox - We tried to find 
this one but were unsuccessful.  There wasn't a lot of trail traffic but 
there was enough that we kept being interrupted.  In addition, it was 
raining for three days straight here in So. Cal. so every thing is pretty 
waterlogged.  We'll have to try again.</p>
<p>#2 The El Dorado Express Letterbox - Alive and 
well.</p>
<p># 3 Elvis of El Dorado - This was my second try at finding 
the King and this time I brought a compass instead of guesstimating the 
headings.  Still no luck even though the area we ended up at matched the 
directions really well.  The area looks pretty trampled up and the area is 
a popular fishing area so perhaps Elvis has left the building?</p>
<p># 4 El Dorado Lady - I'm pretty sure that the Lady is 
missing.  I brought my son and put him on my shoulders to confirm that the 
hole was empty.  No one was home.</p>
<p># 5 The Search for El Dorado - Alive and well.  This 
one is a lot of fun to find when it has been raining.  : P</p>
<p>#6 "Billie Boswell Bike Path" - Alive and well.</p>
<p>Bonus Box - It was floating and visible when we found it 
(if someone knew where to look).  The container also leaked and had smelly 
water in it.  I dried everything out as well as I could and rebagged 
the log book (damp) and stamp (completely waterlogged).  I used one of 
the old bags as a gasket between the lid and the bottle to see if that will help 
keep the water out of the container.</p></div>
