If you're going to be on I-684, it would be well worth your while to take a small detour east along I -84 to Danbury, CT. and attend the gathering!(were you already planning on that?) If you didn't know about it, under the CT clues, print out the "Tarrywyle Park" clues. They have directions to the park in them from 84 east or west. There will be a large abundance of letterboxers present that could suggest/arrange quite a day or two of letterboxing here in CT!!  Hope to see you there!    --- Northstar<br/>
