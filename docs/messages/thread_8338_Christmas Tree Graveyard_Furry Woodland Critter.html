Boy, just a little rain can sure make a path slippery!  We slid our way down <br/>
the hill and across the creeks.  Some of the stairs had given way and were <br/>
pulling out of the bank.  Later on we saw a couple of "trail closed due to <br/>
erosion" signs.  But, since the rain in the creek had lifted the sign off of <br/>
its post we didn't really know to which trail it referred!  I would have to <br/>
guess they meant those stairs.  However, the sign was farther down the creek <br/>
so who knows!  No wood peckers were sighted although we wore red caps to <br/>
match their red heads!<br/>
<br/>
We had a little trouble with the furry woodland creature, taking the wrong <br/>
path and generally making life harder on ourselves....  The stamp was very <br/>
cute!  We will have to try and carve our own.  The littlest BeMa member went <br/>
scrambling all over the house looking for big 'ole erasers to carve into <br/>
stamps (the thought of her with a carving knife is a leetle scary!...)<br/>
<br/>
It was nice to be peaceful in the woods and not worrying about whether it is <br/>
safe at the strip centers or missing all the soccer games which have been <br/>
cancelled.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe tomorrow we'll go out again.  Our schedule has cleared up a lot <br/>
unexpectedly (they even cancelled puppy kindergarten!)  BeMa<br/>

We got turned around looking for Furry too.  Because we made <br/>
assumptions.  But figuring it out despite problems is part of the fun.<br/>
<br/>
Your littlest BeMa can draw and you can carve right?  I've had a lot <br/>
of fun just tracing pencil over small pictures and them turning the <br/>
paper over and rubbbing it on the eraser to transfer it.<br/>
