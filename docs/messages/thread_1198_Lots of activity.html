What a coup that would be to get an article there. Do we have a generic article that we can use to copy and paste and send to newsletters or clubs and organizations that we belong to. I know I have some places I could try to get it printed in but I am not a good writer or explainer of things so a generic article would be great for me. I really appreciate the work others have done in this regard. I'll try to thank you by hiding more and more boxes. Come on down!<br/>
