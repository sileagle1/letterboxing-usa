&gt; Here is another in the Wolf Mystery Letterbox series.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Title:   Maine Wolf Mystery Letterbox<br/>
&gt; Location:   Somewhere in Maine<br/>
&gt; Difficulty:   Easy, could even be called a drive by. Total round <br/>
trip is 1/2 mile.<br/>
&gt; Placed on 28 September 2002 by the lonemasswolf and YIMS<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Clues:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am located in my woods on my road next to my farm.<br/>
&gt; From the parking lot, take the Shore and Casco Bay Trail to the <br/>
intersection with the Casco Bay Trail.<br/>
&gt; At the intersection, continue right on the Casco Bay Trail.<br/>
&gt; Follow this trail to the Animals of the Bay Sign.<br/>
&gt; Continue along the trail for 40 more paces.<br/>
&gt; Look into the woods towards the left to see two large flat sandwich <br/>
rocks.<br/>
&gt; I am hiding in the crevasse between those two large flat rocks.<br/>
&gt; You will need a stick to get me out.<br/>
