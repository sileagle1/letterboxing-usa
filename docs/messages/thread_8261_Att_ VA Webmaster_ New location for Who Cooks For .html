                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've moved Who Cooks For You? because it was so near private <br/>
land. I apologize for the extra work this has caused you.<br/>
Riverbend Park #4, Fairfax County VA. Nearest town is Great <br/>
Falls. Follow the previous instructions to Riverbend Park Nature <br/>
Center. Difficulty: It is about a 20-25 minute walk each way and <br/>
the return trip is partly uphill. You will need a compass, and you'll <br/>
need to differentiate between a step and a pace. From the <br/>
parking lot walk to the Nature Center and follow the signs to the <br/>
Paw-Paw Trail. Take the trail down the hill, across the bridge and <br/>
up to the intersection with a service road. Turn right on the <br/>
trail/road and walk down past the pond (bearing right here) to the <br/>
intersection with the River Trail. Head upriver on this trail for <br/>
10-12 minutes till you come to a new earthen bridge over a <br/>
creek. Cross the creek and walk about 80 paces (1 1/2 minutes) <br/>
till you come to a small path bearing about 8 degrees, almost <br/>
due south. Follow this path for 14-15 paces to a double-trunked <br/>
tulip tree with a horizontal scar 3 1/2 feet up its north trunk. From <br/>
this tree walk, on a heading of 158 degrees, about 25 paces to a <br/>
tall sycamore. Now take a bearing of 38 degrees and walk about <br/>
14 steps to another large sycamore. Who Cooks For You? is at <br/>
the base of this tree, on the north side, under sticks, leaves and <br/>
sycamore bark.<br/>
