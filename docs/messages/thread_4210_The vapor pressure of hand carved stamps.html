<br/>
*We had a meeting - me, myself, and I - and I was the only one that <br/>
thought I should write this.  So I'm writing it.<br/>
<br/>
The simple fact is that stamps disappear.  Of the 56 boxes I have put <br/>
stamps in, two of the stamps have disappeared - so far - 3 months.  <br/>
Eleven of the total stamps are actually in geocaches.  One stamp was <br/>
definitely stolen by a non-letterboxer.  The rascal left the box, and <br/>
the log, but took the stamp.  From what I can gather it was one of <br/>
the Procyon lotor, a group of notorious stamp stealers.  I believed <br/>
all precautions had been taken, but the odor of the box apparently <br/>
led to its discovery.<br/>
<br/>
Another stamp was discovered to be missing - uh, not discovered to be <br/>
present - in a hybrid geocache/letterbox.  No note was made in the <br/>
log about taking the stamp, either in the box or on the web.  A <br/>
search of the ground around the box found no accidentally dropped <br/>
stamp.  The ammobox had none of the puncture marks usually left as a <br/>
calling card by the Procyon lotor clan.  <br/>
<br/>
I was left with no other reasonable explanation other than - like a <br/>
drop of water on a summer sun heated rock - the vapor pressure got to <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
*******************<br/>
<br/>
In our web letterboxing web pages we have made sure that those <br/>
looking for letterboxes know:  <br/>
<br/>
WAIVER OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLAIMER:  Letterboxing, like any <br/>
outdoor sport, carries the risk of unforeseen hazards... <br/>
<br/>
You know the rest by heart. <br/>
<br/>
I think it may be about time we included another WORAD:  It could go <br/>
something like this:<br/>
<br/>
WAIVER OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLAIMER:  <br/>
Leaving letterboxes out for others to find is a usually enjoyable <br/>
activity albeit with several known risks and it likely has other <br/>
risks less well understood - what doesn't?  <br/>
-There is a small risk that the enjoyment of creating, writing, and <br/>
placing the letterbox and its associated clues will not offset the <br/>
expense or trouble expended in creating the box, stamp, and clues.  <br/>
This risk benefit ratio - as experienced by the letterboxer may <br/>
change from time to time.  <br/>
-IMPORTANT: There is a risk that your box may not be found for a very <br/>
long time, a time which can extend to the environs of infinity. (A) <br/>
-IMPORTANT: There is a risk that the box, or a portion of its <br/>
contents, may be stolen, borrowed, photographed, replaced with a key <br/>
chain, or simply evaporate.  This experience may be irritating to <br/>
painful, may cause lost sleep, additional expense, may occasion new <br/>
creative efforts, and require additional hiking and driving time <br/>
while further wearing down your boots, tires and suspension. (B)<br/>
-It is well understood that the more likely you design your clues and <br/>
the physical placement of the box to attract and engage others in the <br/>
actual finding of the box, the more likely it is that the previous <br/>
set of risks (B) will transpire, but this approach will limit risk <br/>
set (A).<br/>
-It can never be best understood by more than one letterboxer - how <br/>
to make boxes which maintain high appeal while engendering only <br/>
minimal risk of ever being discovered by more than a half of a <br/>
handful of individuals.<br/>

Unfortunately my tongue is stuck so deeply in my cheek that I may now <br/>
need to repair to the Emergency Department for treatment. ;o<br/>

<br/>
I've had this happen twice.  Apparently, some local critter found the<br/>
contents of the box interesting of of possible nutritional content.<br/>
In one case, extensive searching of the surrounding area actually<br/>
located the stamp, dirty, and possessing a number of distinct bite<br/>
marks indicating that the stamp was sampled.  Apparently, the critter<br/>
didn't care for Staedler erasers.  It apparently wasn't a racoon,<br/>
though, the bite marks are rather small.  Any experts in animal<br/>
dentition?<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, that stamp moves on... I've got it all prepped as a hitchiker<br/>
for the next box I come across.<br/>
