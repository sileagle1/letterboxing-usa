        We decided to do the Gazebo Series today due to the heavy <br/>
snow cover (AGAIN!  Isn't it spring yet?).  We found them all dry and <br/>
safe, and WOW are they terrific!!  Just wanted to let you know that a <br/>
few of the log books were full- #2,4 and 5.  Also, the velcro <br/>
appeared to have come off box #2 and almost off on box #4.  Other <br/>
than that, they were in great shape.  We loved the locations of the <br/>
boxes and the gazebos.  We found some lovely views.  Thank you for <br/>
some pleasant snowy boxes. <br/>
