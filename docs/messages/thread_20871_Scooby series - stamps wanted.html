Hello!<br/>
<br/>
We have a series planted in VA right now featuring the faces of the <br/>
five main scooby doo characters.  We'd like to get a whole bunch <br/>
more stamps of other scooby related things - monsters, etc.  Neither <br/>
of us are that great at carving so we were wondering if anyone would <br/>
like to send in stamps?  The series is along a great trail and <br/>
everyone seems to enjoy it.  I'd like to just take over the whole <br/>
area and have it be filled with all scooby.  <br/>
<br/>
If you're interested in having your stamp be part of it the series, <br/>
please email us at justplaingeorge@yahoo.com and let us know <br/>
who/what you'd like to carve!  We'll do the planting and the clue <br/>
writing for you!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
