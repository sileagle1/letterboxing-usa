   Take Rte 89 at Mansfield Center Drive past Southeast School and <br/>
Park at the ballfields.<br/>
<br/>
Hut one , hut 2 , blitz ,and touchdown............  off the field <br/>
look between touchdown and the Golden Gate. About half way between is <br/>
a tree which is full of information. Behind it is what you seek. <br/>
Stamp privately and return as you found it for the next letterboxer.<br/>
