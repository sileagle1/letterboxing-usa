I'm afraid this LB is missing; I reported it missing on this Group in <br/>
March. It's a very pretty hike, though, and seemed like a great <br/>
hiding place. <br/>

&gt; Clues were pretty straight forward, and everything went exactly as <br/>
it <br/>

&gt; This was planted in December by 'Threedigs', does anyone know if <br/>
