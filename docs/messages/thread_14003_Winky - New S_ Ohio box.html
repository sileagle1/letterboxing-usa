Near the intersection of U.S. Route #52 and Ohio Route #93 at <br/>
Ironton, Ohio, is an old highway tunnel known as the Historic 75 <br/>
Tunnel.  This is where you need to go.  The tunnel is blocked off so <br/>
you can't go in there but beside the tunnel is a seemingly endless <br/>
set of wooden stairs up to an overlook on top of the hill.  Climb <br/>
these stairs.  Admire the view, catch your breath, and then notice a <br/>
ramp from the platform down to the hilltop.  Go down the ramp and go <br/>
about 7 paces (1 pace = 2 steps) straight ahead to a tall maple tree <br/>
with a fork about 3 feet above the ground.  Behind this tree you'll <br/>
find our little Winky hiding under some sticks and rocks.<br/>
