kept us away.<br/>
On 3/16 a partial ESAK crew, with a few additions, headed out to <br/>
Cedar Hill Cemetery and found three out of the five boxes hidden <br/>
there. We knew going in that two were missing but that didn't stop us <br/>
from following the clues to their exact locations anyway. Sam Colt <br/>
and JP Morgan Letterboxes at Cedar Hill Cemetery have gone missing as <br/>
the clues stated. All other boxes are in fine shape.<br/>
<br/>
But on a good note, we found the Julliette Hitchhiker and will be <br/>
back in the field soon.<br/>
<br/>
On 3/29, Josina and I spent the day riding our mountain bikes from <br/>
Vernon all the way to the East Hop River Rail Trail letterbox. What a <br/>
great ride that was. Not for the casual biker I would say, especially <br/>
from Vernon. My guess is its close to a 30 mile round trip if the <br/>
East Hop River box is your target.  <br/>
<br/>
We picked up the Rockville Spur box which was right out in the open <br/>
(we replaced it at the spot intended) and then headed back out to bag <br/>
the Valley Falls Rail to Trail box along with the West Hop River Rail <br/>
to Trail box. All 4 boxes are in fine shape.<br/>
<br/>
Time was short so we didn't pick up the three boxes at Valley Falls <br/>
but we'll be back for sure to get those.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for the great box locations.<br/>
