You need to complete this clue during the daytime, when the <br/>
Visitor's Center is open (usually between 10am and 4pm). The <br/>
facts you'll need to answer these questions can be found by: <br/>
watching the film at the Visitor's Center; reading the signs at the <br/>
house next to the farm; reading the signs at the base of the huts; <br/>
or, reading the signs on the trail itself (but not necessarily in that <br/>
order). But, which Visitor's Center could it be?<br/>
<br/>
For each of the following questions you'll find four choices; next <br/>
to the correct answer you'll see a corresponding number. These <br/>
