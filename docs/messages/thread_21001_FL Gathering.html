                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm posting notice of this mostly on the Southeast boards and list, but in <br/>
case there's anyone planning to be in the Fort Lauderdale area on February 5, <br/>
we're having in picnic/exchange/meet&amp;greet that day.<br/>
<br/>
Come join us for Florida's Fabulous Flamingo Fiesta, on February 5, 2005.   <br/>
We'd love to have you come.   If you can let me know at StDebb at aol.com, <br/>
that'd be great, but if not, and your plans change at the last minute, y'all come <br/>
anyway!<br/>
<br/>
It'll be a Tree Tops Park in Davie, FL (which is basically southwest Fort <br/>
Lauderdale).   There'll be boxes in the park--some are already there, some will <br/>
be planted for the event--which everyone will be free to go after on their own <br/>
schedule.   We'll picnic (bring your own food, and a dish to share if you <br/>
wish), we'll exchange, we'll talk boxing.   A good time will be had by all!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there!<br/>
<br/>
