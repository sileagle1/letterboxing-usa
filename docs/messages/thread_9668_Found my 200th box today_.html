                    <html><body>While out at Merrow Park in Mansfield, CT, I found my 200th box at the Merrow Park Letterbox!  Alan (Letterboxer2002) came prepared for the celebration by bringing two bottles of the best Root Beer to pop open at the box site!  I don't remember what brand it was off the top of my head, but the bottle is in the car....  All I know, it was awesome!
<br/>
<br/>Another great treat of the day, was meeting up with Chuck, Molly and Chickabirdie at the Coney Rock Preserve to exchange and hand over to Chuck the Purple Heart stamp for getting injured in the line of letterboxing!  We (Alan and I) were excited when Chickabirdie handed us a couple of packages of Christmas cookies (They're the ones that look like snowflakes... I think they're italian ?????) and two hitchhiker exchanges!
<br/>
<br/>After our lovely chat with the Straub family, we headed out to find the Singing Men, and I'm happy to report that we were victorious!!!  It was actually not very hard, once we found the correct parking lot :-)  So all in all, we found the following boxes in fairly good order.  If not in good order, I will state this.
<br/>
<br/>Mother Daughter: GREAT STAMP AND COLOR!
<br/>The Princess Diaries Hitchhiker
<br/>The Duffer Hitchhiker
<br/>THe Singing Men
<br/>Barrows Pond
<br/>Squirrel's Treasure
<br/>The Three Letterboxes in the Pink Panther Series
<br/>The Three Wizards Letterbox Series
<br/>Merrow Pond (needs a new ziploc... we were unfortunately all out :-(    )
<br/>Dendrology 101  (needs a new ziploc....we were unfortunately still all out :-(  )

<br/>Thanks Alan for a great day!

   Giving Chuck the Purple Heart was a neat thing to do. He deserved <br/>
it. Chickabirdie and Molly should get hero medal stamps for saving <br/>
the wounded veteran letterboxer. (I just love happy endings)<br/>
