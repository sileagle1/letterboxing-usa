Clue page: http://www.pcdx.com/pclg/clue21.htm<br/>
<br/>
The hertzian waves were something of a mystery, magic in the air, intangible. <br/>
How, then, to harness the ether, to command it to bend to our will, to assist <br/>
us in speaking to the stars?<br/>
<br/>
One man attempted to answer this question, and in doing so, changed the <br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
First, he reached one end of his house from the other. Then, he spoke to the <br/>
garden.<br/>
<br/>
Later, his voice grew stronger, reaching farther than ever before, beyond the <br/>
range of vision and imagination, across the seas and through the clouds. <br/>
Around the world, people applauded, awed by that which was now possible.<br/>
<br/>
Later, this man built towers, adorned with bronze. The towers reached into the <br/>
sky, as if to grasp the heavens and pull them closer to home. The waves <br/>
streamed outwards, a power never before seen.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, another man even used this power to make his points. The spark of this <br/>
act is the location you seek. And, although the spark has faded, you'll find a <br/>
memento at this place to keep forever.<br/>
<br/>
Under the northeast corner of the wooden structure, look underneath a small <br/>
pile of rocks....<br/>
