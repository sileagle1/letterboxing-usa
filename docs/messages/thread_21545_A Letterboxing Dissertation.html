<br/>
Some of you may remember my post to the talklist in July last year.  I was<br/>
preparing to conduct a disseration on letterboxing to complete my<br/>
geography degree in the UK.  I'm am now pleased to say that after over a<br/>
year of work on this dissertation, it has been completed and I handed it<br/>
in only the other day.<br/>
<br/>
This post is really to say a big thank you to all of the people who gave<br/>
me so much help with my work.  Thank you to all of you who visited my<br/>
website and completed my questionnaire, I had somewhere in the region of<br/>
300 responses!  Also a big thanks to my fantastic interviewees who<br/>
provided me with some great information and a real insight into their<br/>
world of letterboxing;<br/>

My thanks are also extended to all those who met me in Sleeping Giant<br/>
State Park, it was a day of letterboxing that I'll never forget.  Further<br/>
to this I'd like to thank Butterfly, Sadie and Russ, Pete and Lobsta Lady<br/>
for spending another day with me that weekend, you showed me some lovely<br/>
places, beautiful letterboxes and the company couldn't have been better. <br/>
To everyone in the LbNA Baker's Dozen, also to Pam and Debby, thank you<br/>
for sharing your trips to Dartmoor with me and helping me in finding my<br/>
first 100 letterboxes with lots of laughs along the way!<br/>
<br/>
Lastly but by no means least I'd like to say a huge thank you to Mark and<br/>
Sue Pepe.  You really did make my trip to CT a complete success and I<br/>
can't thank you enough for all the help you gave me with my work not only<br/>
in CT but before and after my trip through the many emails that we sent. <br/>
I can't wait to see you both again either on your next trip to the UK or<br/>
when I eventually get back to the US!<br/>
<br/>
Once again my thanks to everyone connected to my disseration.<br/>
Without you it just wouldn't have even been possible.<br/>

What a great accomplishment! Is there any chance we'll have the opportunity<br/>
of seeing the finished product?<br/>
I hope we'll get to meet up with you again, either on the next Dartmoor trip<br/>
or here in the states.<br/>
Keep in touch.<br/>
