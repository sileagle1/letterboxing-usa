way today and stopped to hunt this one down, but the only successful <br/>
hunting was a park ranger who noticed I hadn't paid the daily fee (I <br/>
didn't have the right change -- honest).<br/>
<br/>
I am quite confident I had everything right -- it all fit like <br/>
clockwork.  But just to be sure, I tried several other options and <br/>
pace counts, etc., but there really are only a few pines trees in <br/>
that area.  I found the open place in the tree, the dead piece of <br/>
wood and the leaves, even a hollow where a box was possibly <br/>
sitting...  but none to be found.  I wasn't able to find a working e-<br/>
mail address for the person who planted the box -- Arbo, but if they <br/>
will e-mail me off list I will give a better description of where I <br/>
was looking.<br/>
