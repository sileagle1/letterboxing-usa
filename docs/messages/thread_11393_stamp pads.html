<div>We always include either a stamp pad or colored markers in our boxes for a 
couple of reasons.  One reason is that sometimes we carve stamps that we 
think would look best in a certain color, or colors.  Also I know I 
wouldn't want all the stamps in my journal to be the same color.  And 
finally if everyone used a different color ink, the stamp would be filthy, 
everyone would end up with a brown stamp image.  Living in Connecticut we 
have come across very few stamp pads that didn't survive the weather.  Only 
pads that have gotten wet have been a problem for us.  </div>

<p>Never monochromatic!  We agree!  That's why we carry around two different rainbow pads.  In this way, our images are nice and colorful, especially when they feature the additional set of finger prints, dirt smudges, etc. that come from stamping on the ground!...</p>

<div>The Marvy Uchida company makes a line of pens 
called Le Plume II.  These pens have a fine point pen on one end and a 
'brush' tip on the other end.  The brush tip can be used to color the 
stamps and the pen end can be used to write in the log books.  They come in 
packs of 12 and there are several different set of colors.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The nice thing about these is their 
portability.  The multiple colors can be used to color the stamp as 
multiple colors.  After coloring all of the different colors that you want, 
breathe on the stamp.  The moisture and heat of your breath will ensure 
that the colors will transfer from the stamp onto the paper.  This is 
called 'huffing'.</div>

<p>Of the paltry 12 or 15 boxes I have found, I don't think even 1/4 of them 
  had pads or pencils.  I solve the color issue for myself by carrying 6 or 
  8 different cat's eye pads.  They are tiny and come in wonderful 
  colors.  That way I have been able to choose a color that seemed to go 
  with the image.  (I also change the colors I use for my signature stamp,

But spare pens or pencils are easy enough to include as long as there<br/>
is room. I'm surprised how many people stumble across the boxes and<br/>
don't have a stamp or anything to write with. Such scatter-brained<br/>
letterboxers! At least with a pen in there they can leave a comment<br/>
telling how they found the box or what they think of it.<br/>

&gt;    After reading todays posts about soggy ink pads, am I correct in <br/>
&gt; thinking all the New England boxes have their own stamp pads? We live <br/>
&gt; in the mid-atlantic region and we are wondering why would you put <br/>
&gt; them in the boxes when you carry your own stamp pad that could be <br/>
&gt; used. <br/>
&gt;    Yesterday was the first time we encountered a stamp pad included <br/>
&gt; in every box. I also notice you put pencils in your boxes too. We <br/>
&gt; don't. Our boxes are bare bones; logbook and stamp. Occasionally you <br/>
&gt; might find one of Appledumpling Gangs marbles and I do have a little <br/>
&gt; wizard statue floating around. <br/>
&gt;    So anyone heading to MD, DC, or VA should bring their own stamp <br/>
&gt; pad and pen or pencil.<br/>

Hi Psychomommy,<br/>
<br/>
Of the 200+ boxes we have found here in NE all but 2 had there own <br/>
ink pads . The ones that didn't I assumed were missing and left a <br/>
spare that I always carry ( Luckily the green fit in well with the <br/>
stamp images ) Some boxes I would think need a certain color  " Blue <br/>
Jay at Blue Pond " just wouldn't have seemed right in our green or <br/>
any other color . I like the idea of a multi color ink pad and will <br/>
add one to the  way too much stuff I already carry . <br/>

  Thanks for posting advice about using these markers. My daughter <br/>
and I spotted them at Michaels just the other day and we bought one <br/>
to try, along with our cats eye inkpads.<br/>
I will have to pick up a few more colors so we can try multi colors <br/>
that fit the picture. More fun!  <br/>
  Is the ink reasonably permanent?<br/>

&gt; The Marvy Uchida company makes a line of pens called Le Plume II.  <br/>
These pens have a fine point pen on one end and a 'brush' tip on the <br/>
other end.  The brush tip can be used to color the stamps and the pen <br/>
end can be used to write in the log books.  They come in packs of 12 <br/>
and there are several different set of colors.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The nice thing about these is their portability.  The multiple <br/>
colors can be used to color the stamp as multiple colors.  After <br/>
coloring all of the different colors that you want, breathe on the <br/>
stamp.  The moisture and heat of your breath will ensure that the <br/>
colors will transfer from the stamp onto the paper.  This is <br/>
called 'huffing'.<br/>
