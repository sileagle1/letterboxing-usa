the world and elements. Hidden on the historical Society's property <br/>
they called a member cleanup crew to see what could be done with the <br/>
tree and the school outhouse it crushed. There was the box. One of <br/>
the workers said" I found someones diary!" But a wiser and more <br/>
enlightened member said" NOoooo that's a letterbox! I know what to do <br/>
with that." So it is home waiting for the mess to be cleaned up and <br/>
the grounds quiet again and then to be returned to a quiet spot <br/>
there.So please all interested give us a couple weeks and the little <br/>
red school will return to it's spot. Thanks   leader of the Pack<br/>
