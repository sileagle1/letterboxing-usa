Can you see the Date Line interview.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So tell me again why are you in jail?<br/>
<br/>
Well I hid a tupperware in the woods containing a log and hand <br/>
carved stamp, and post clues on the internet for folks to go find <br/>
and enjoy the park it was in.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So someone most have been injured or something for you to be <br/>
here?<br/>
<br/>
No, just multitudes of people arriving at different times to find it <br/>
and enjoy the area.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And they put you in jail?<br/>
<br/>
Ya I'm bunking with Bubba who killed his whole family after smoking <br/>
crack.  He wants me to carve him a P stamp so when he gets out on a <br/>
technicality he can try this LB thing.  He's even going to make me a <br/>
shank to carve with.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Mr. Legislator why do you think Mr. Nut should be in jail?<br/>
<br/>
Well he hid something on our property that enticed people to visit <br/>
our parks and generate tourist dollars to our state and we just <br/>
won't have that.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well that doesn't sound so bad.<br/>
<br/>
Oh but it is.  These LB'rs walk off the trails and damage the <br/>
vegetation.  The next thing they'll do is pick up trash along the <br/>
trails and then who knows what next.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Isn't it park policy to walk off the trail 50' or more to <br/>
answer the call of nature and what's wrong with picking up trash?<br/>
<br/>
Well when they pick up trash it's taking away jobs from our Rangers <br/>
and I don't think anyone pee's in the woods anymore.<br/>

Given your history with the "Law", Steve, if anyone ended up bunking <br/>
with Bubba over tupperware in the woods it'd probably be you. :-P<br/>
<br/>
JK... Great interview, man. Hope I never see it in real life!<br/>
