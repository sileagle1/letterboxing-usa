Fun in the Cold Letterbox <br/>
<br/>
Placed by J&amp;A-Bear on 15 February 2003 <br/>
Cascade, ID <br/>
Valley County <br/>
<br/>
Directions: From State Route 55 at Cascade head<br/>
northeast on Warm Lake Road/FR22 for about 23 miles<br/>
until you come to Forest Road 474.  We parked on the<br/>
right as the FR 474 was closed to vehicles this time<br/>
of year because of snow.  <br/>
<br/>
Description: An easy 4-mile hike round trip takes<br/>
about 2-3 hours on snowshoes.  In the winter you can<br/>
cross-country ski, snowshoe, or use a snowmobile to<br/>
access this letterbox.  In the summer you can actually<br/>
drive right to the trail and only walk  a mile<br/>
roundtrip. There is Mollys Tubs Hot Springs on the<br/>
way and Mollys Hot Springs (unfortunately this one<br/>
has been neglected) near the letterbox.  For more<br/>
detailed information read about the Hot Springs in<br/>
Hiking Hot Springs in the Pacific Northwest, a Falcon<br/>
Guide written by Evie Litton.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Start your trek at the intersection of Warm<br/>
Lake Rd and FR 474 and follow the Forest Road south<br/>
about 2 miles (.6 miles past Mollys Tubs) to your<br/>
first trail junction.  Head west/right on the path<br/>
blocked to motor vehicles.  Cross the bridge and meet<br/>
the tree standing 15 steps/8 paces in front of you. <br/>
Shoot for the arrowhead crack in the rocks at 320<br/>
degrees.  Under the flat rock to its left is Fun in<br/>
the Cold letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
Beware when reaching into dark places.  <br/>
