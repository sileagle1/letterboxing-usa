Christmas Star of Wantastiquet<br/>
Wantastiquet Mt., Hinsdale, NH<br/>
Cheshire County<br/>
(Also very close to Brattleboro, VT)<br/>
<br/>
When: August 23, 2002<br/>
By: Ellen, Mountain Maple<br/>
Distance: 1.4 hours<br/>
Time: 2-3 hours<br/>
Difficult Walk/ Easy Hike<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take I-91 to VT exit 1 and drive into downtown Brattleboro, VT.<br/>
At the intersection of Canal, Bridge and Main street, take a right onto<br/>
Bridge which is also Route 119.  Cross the two bridges that take you into<br/>
New Hampshire, after the second bridge, take your first left, onto Mountain<br/>
Rd.  At the end of the dirt road, drive between the two granite posts and<br/>
park in the lot.<br/>
<br/>
Wantastiquet is a Native American word meaning "Waters that flow from the<br/>
West."  At the base of Wantastiquet is the confluence of the West and<br/>
Conneticut rivers.  Every Christmas a large lighted star is set upon the top<br/>
of Wantastiquet, a friendly sign of peace watching over the residents of<br/>
Brattleboro below.  From the top of the mountain you will share the view<br/>
that the star does.<br/>
<br/>
Hike Wantastiquet mountain!  The main trail up was once used as a road and<br/>
is therefore fairly level, with many switchbacks.  You'll see a series of<br/>
smaller trails branching off the main trail... these are steeper shortcuts,<br/>
but all will lead you back to the main trail.<br/>
<br/>
When you reach the top of the mountain, enjoy the view!  All of Brattleboro<br/>
and Southern Vermont stretches below you in a panorama.<br/>
<br/>
When you are ready, put your back to the checkerboard marker, facing back<br/>
down the trail from where you came. Sight down the trail at 74 degrees and<br/>
take approximately 22 paces.  Careful on the rocks!  Exact paces not<br/>
necessary.  From here you can see a large lichen covered boulder to your<br/>
right.  Under the NE side of the rock you'll find your prize!<br/>
<br/>
Please be discreet... this mountain is an extrememly popular hiking spot.<br/>
<br/>
Watch for glass.  There are many broken shards all around the top of the<br/>
mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
