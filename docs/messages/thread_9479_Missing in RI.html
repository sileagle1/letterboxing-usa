<br/>
I am surprised to hear that the Fort Weatherill box is among the <br/>
missing.  I just did it less than 2 weeks ago (NOV 20) and the box <br/>
was fine.  It is such a beautiful spot, to bad it went missing.<br/>
<br/>
I am sad to hear about the Quonochontaug box.  It was the first <br/>
mystery box I ever found.<br/>

Grrrrrr ... Quonochontaug.  Let me tell you about Quonochontaug.<br/>
<br/>
I find it odd that this of all LBs would go missing.  I know that it <br/>
had been moved once or twice (since the clues listed junipers but the <br/>
box lay beneath arborvitaes, with a note in the journal indicating <br/>
the move ....)<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm ... maybe Mulder took it with him when he went on the run!  We <br/>
could have our first extraterrestrial hitchhiker on our hands!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, it's the tryptophan from the turkey ....<br/>
