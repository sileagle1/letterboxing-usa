Woods in North Bennington, Vermont. In the Mid 19th century Trenor<br/>
Park-Thomas left the frantic pace of San Francisco and returned to his<br/>
family home in Vermont. He suffered a nervous breakdown but devised an<br/>
ingenious form of self therapy. He decided to construct a carriageway<br/>
through the family woodlot that was exactly one mile in length and did not<br/>
require the cutting of a single tree. Unfortunately, later generations were<br/>
not so conservation minded. The woods you see here today are second growth<br/>
with the remains of Park-Thomas' original trees scattered here and there.<br/>
One of these has become a cozy home for the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: From Bennington head north on 67a to the town of North<br/>
Bennington. At the diminutive town green turn left on West Street. One<br/>
block up is the entrance to the historic Park-McCullough House. you can<br/>
stop here and tour the house and walk to The Mile-Around Woods or proceed a<br/>
quarter mile farther up the road in your car and park in a gravel turnout<br/>
on the left side of the road. <br/>
To the letterbox: Take the path between the stone pillars and bear right to<br/>
the beginning of the Trail where you will find an interpretive sign. Take<br/>
note of the dates when the property was acquired and when the builder of<br/>
the trail returned from California as well as the address of the folks who<br/>
maintain the trail today.<br/>
Walk counter clockwise around the loop until you see a lithic landmark to<br/>
your right. At this point set your compass to the last three digits of the<br/>
Fund's zip code. Then multiply the third digits in the two noted dates to<br/>
learn the number of steps to the letterbox. It lives behind a wooden hatch<br/>
cover.<br/>
