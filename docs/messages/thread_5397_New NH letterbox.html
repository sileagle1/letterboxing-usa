Dedicated to our parents, Bob and Rose, Mario and Lena<br/>
<br/>
Franconia Notch, NH<br/>
Planted by GBHeron on 5/4/02. <br/>
<br/>
Time: Approximately 2 1/2 hours  (Bring a picnic lunch or snack for<br/>
      the summit.)<br/>
Distance: 3 miles, round trip<br/>
Trail Difficulty: Continuous moderate climb to summit.(Inadvisable in <br/>
                  snowy or icy conditions)<br/>
<br/>
Getting There: From  NH Rte. 3 in Franconia Notch take Flume Visitor <br/>
Center Turn Off. On driveway into visitor center turn left and park <br/>
near the start of the Bike Path. Take the Bike Path north.  The Mt. <br/>
Pemigewasset Trail starts at a left turn 100 ft. up the Bike Path. <br/>
(For a slightly longer hike, try ascending the summit via the 1.8 <br/>
mile AMC Indian Head Trail.  The trailhead starts just north of the <br/>
Beacon Resort and just south of the Franconia Notch State Park <br/>
boundary on Rte. 3.  The two trails meet and join near the summit.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  The Mt. Pemigewasset Trail is poorly marked but well-worn <br/>
which makes it easy to follow.  The trail ascends steadily through a <br/>
hardwood forest, crossing four brooks before reaching halfway up the <br/>
summit.  The upper portion of the trail brings you through a forest <br/>
of evergreens before landing you on top of the ledge. Enjoy the view <br/>
of the valley and mountains to the south and west.  Continue along to <br/>
the left and rear of Pemi's stony brow.  Franconia Ridge rises in the <br/>
E-NE.  Heading north you will reach a point where you can go no <br/>
further (unless you're Spiderman).  Turn back.  Under the west side <br/>
of a small boulder Parental Presence is waiting to offer it's gift.  <br/>
Be careful, discretion may be tricky.  This summit was heavily <br/>
traveled even in early May.  <br/>
