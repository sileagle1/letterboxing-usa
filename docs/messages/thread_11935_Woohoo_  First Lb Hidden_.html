Texas.  No others are listed on the web site or in any other sites I <br/>

excitement, I forgot to date the logbook!  Would whoever finds this <br/>
box first please add the date "Planted April 12, 2003" to the cover?  <br/>
I have the "Planted" part but forgot to go ahead and put in the <br/>
date...I was afraid we might not find a suitable spot in our hunt <br/>
yesterday.<br/>
Thanks to all of you for introducing me to a fun new hobby I can <br/>
share with my family!<br/>

Well, I did it again!  In my excitement to report the planting of <br/>
this letterbox, I put in the wrong date!!!!  If you are the first one <br/>
to this box, please put the date of April 13 on the cover!  Sorry!<br/>
