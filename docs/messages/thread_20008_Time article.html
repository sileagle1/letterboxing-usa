Though I rarely post, I wanted to respond to your concerns about <br/>
publicity because your posts over the years have always been <br/>
respectful of others, cogent and thoughtfully written.<br/>
<br/>
I was involved with the "Time" reporter and article. Like you, I <br/>
hestitated about doing this at all. I exchanged emails with the <br/>
others who were mentioned, all veteran letterboxers, and, I think I <br/>
can speak for all involved. We felt that if we didn't do this and <br/>
emphasize the traditions associated with the game, the wrong <br/>
impression would have been given to the reading public and, sadly, <br/>
even more letterboxes would go missing. Doing this was truly a double <br/>
edged sword. <br/>
<br/>
Further, we invited the writer of the piece, Deirdre Van Dyk, to <br/>
Connecticut to letterbox with those of us in the East who had done <br/>
phone interviews with her. Deirdre graciously gave up her one day a <br/>
week off and joined us. Before we set one foot on a trail, we sat <br/>
with her at lunch and discussed in great detail the nuances of the <br/>
game and how playing it runs along a continuum from complete stealth <br/>
and anonymity to others who are much more open. Incidentally, in <br/>
advance of Deridre's coming to Connecticut and writing the piece, she <br/>
read Randy Hall's book. Most of us had several telephone <br/>
conversations with her and we emailed back and forth constantly <br/>
because she was committed to painting as accurate a picture as she <br/>
could. Shortly before publication, her editor reduced her allotted <br/>
space to 99 lines so she had to cut quite a bit of content from the <br/>
piece. <br/>
<br/>
While we all were letterboxing with Deirdre, we happened upon some <br/>
technical scenarios that, I feel, helped her understand how the game <br/>
is played and some of the issues we all face and discuss on the talk-<br/>
lists. We came upon a poorly hidden letterbox, some clues that were <br/>
written in such a way as to cause undesirable impact to the <br/>
environment and a box hidden in plain sight of a family gathering <br/>
that we decided to pass on. We took the time to point these things <br/>
out to her and I feel she achieved a more balanced perspective that <br/>
most letterboxers are sensitive to the environment and LNT, are <br/>
thoughtful and respectful people who would pass up a letterbox rather <br/>
than compromise its location to non-boxers. <br/>
<br/>
Whether the piece was 99 lines or 9 pages, it would have attracted <br/>
people to our beloved game who had both good and bad intentions,  <br/>
some who will stay and become great and interesting players or others <br/>
who will try it, lose interest and fade away. In that regard, if <br/>
the "Time" article was to happen at all, ironically, we probably have <br/>
the writer's editor to thank for preventing too much from being <br/>
written about it. The downside is that regional media sources who <br/>
picked up on the piece are now clammoring for their own spin, as many <br/>
of you have already found out. Best kept secrets aren't secrets for <br/>
very long.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think we are all saddened by the loss of a letterbox, particularly <br/>
when it happens at the hand of man. While art is ephemeral, it still <br/>
smarts and makes us ask why anyone would be so thoughtless. This is <br/>
one reason so many of us harp "ad nauseum" on the importance of <br/>
rehiding a box carefully and making good choices about hiding spots. <br/>
These things need to be reiterated over and over somewhere so that <br/>
those who are new to the game of letterboxing follow on with respect <br/>
for the efforts by and hard work from every boxer who preceded them. <br/>
It's also just one reason why so many of us are not publishing our <br/>
clues any longer and making them WOM. <br/>
<br/>
Your comment about media people having their own agendas is true.The <br/>
nature of the press is that, in theory, it may strive for balance, <br/>
but the end result is always presented with a point of view. It was <br/>
extremely important for those of us who were involved with "Time" to <br/>
make sure that the article was as balanced as it could be. If it had <br/>
to happen at all, I, for one, am thankful to have worked with a <br/>
reporter who was generous of herself and her time, understood our <br/>
delimma and attempted to write about letterboxing as fairly as <br/>
possible.<br/>

&gt; Perhaps I am misunderstanding this. You participated in the article <br/>
and directed people to the website but then don't post your own clues <br/>
on the website for fear of repercussions from publicity? It doesn't <br/>
seem to make sense to me....<br/>
<br/>
This is not an inconsistent logic. By participating in the interview, <br/>
a top-notch 'boxer like Alafair has the opportunity to put the best <br/>
possible spin on the article. Ignoring the inevitable "Time Article" <br/>
does not make it go away. If the hobby is to stay strong and not <br/>
succumb to dilution from "non-traditionalists", experienced boxers <br/>
need to speak their minds, emphasizing the secrecy of the clues and <br/>
the boxes while publicizing the sport.<br/>
<br/>
As far as WOM (word of mouth) clues, "repercussions from publicity" <br/>
is certainly not the only reason for using them, but it is a valid <br/>
one. Persistent finders will get them, hooligans may not. Keeping <br/>
some of the clues off of the LBNA site, or off of the web entirely, <br/>
adds another dimension to the game. Phyto and I have been known to <br/>
drive hundreds of miles for a good underground box while forsaking <br/>
ten easy boxes near home. <br/>
<br/>
My hat is off to Alafair for speaking up for traditional 'boxing and <br/>
for doing whatever she pleases with her clues!<br/>

<br/>
I figure I can put my take into this, since I participated in the <br/>
article as well but don't post all of my clues to the LbNA website.<br/>
<br/>
I've found my boxes tend to last longer when fewer people find them.  <br/>
I'd like my boxes to last for a long, long time.  Therefore, <br/>
sometimes, it is best if the clues aren't always easily accessible.<br/>
<br/>
If I think too many people are finding one of my boxes--either too <br/>
many for the environment to handle or too many of the types of people <br/>
that I feel aren't doing a good job rehiding the boxes, I'll take the <br/>
clues off LbNA.<br/>
<br/>
Some people don't list clues if they planted the box in a national <br/>
park or some other location where boxes shouldn't be.<br/>
<br/>
There's a lot of reasons not to publish a clue on LbNA, but <br/>
essentially it boils down to the fact that there's someone (or <br/>
several someones--either individually or as a group) that use LbNA <br/>
for their clue source that you don't want finding your letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Historically, there's never been a 'difinitive source' for clues.  <br/>
Part of the challenge is finding the clues in the first place.  Part <br/>
of letterboxing is interacting with other letterboxers that can give <br/>
you tips to other clues that might not be as readily accessible.<br/>
<br/>
The wonderful thing about letterboxing is the variety of people of <br/>
types of boxes it supports.  Some people like easy, straight-forward <br/>
clues served to them on a silver platter--and there are clues for <br/>
those people.  Some people like more selective boxes where the clues <br/>
are hard to come by and once acquired, impossibily difficult to <br/>
crack.  And there are clues for those people.<br/>
<br/>
In the 'old' days, boxes were so few and far between, even listing <br/>
clues on LbNA didn't guarantee anyone would ever get a chance to find <br/>
your boxes anytime soon.  Nowdays, any easy, drive-by box is likely <br/>
to have a full logbook within a few weeks.  A couple of years, it <br/>
might only take a couple of days.<br/>
<br/>
Things change, and people have to adapt.  Those of us who were here <br/>
years ago are adapting by creating WOM clues.  Or listing them on <br/>
alternative websites.  Or listing them only on their own websites.  <br/>
Or clues that need to be mailed.  We aren't necessarily opposed to <br/>
new blood joining the hobby, but we're adapting to that fact.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I hope this helps you see it from my perspective.  *shrug*  =)<br/>

<br/>
When CSCM and I  decided to agree to be interviewed by the Providence<br/>
Journal over a year ago, we agonized over it. We finally decided that we<br/>
would do it BECAUSE reporters have their own agenda. We figured that, as<br/>
veteran 'boxers, we would be able to strongly emphasize the importance of<br/>
hiding, and secrecy and 'leave no trace'. If we didn't do it they might have<br/>
gone with a newbie or with text from the talk list (taken out of context)<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
We figured it was going to be written ANYWAY, so why not be able to steer<br/>
it. We were very explicit..."It's really important to stress this or that to<br/>
your readers..."<br/>

It's a double edged sword, but we wanted to be the ones wielding it. It was<br/>
definitely the same situation with TIME Magazine.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Time article<br/>
<br/>
Don,<br/>
<br/>
Though I rarely post, I wanted to respond to your concerns about<br/>
publicity because your posts over the years have always been<br/>
respectful of others, cogent and thoughtfully written.<br/>
<br/>
I was involved with the "Time" reporter and article. Like you, I<br/>
hestitated about doing this at all. I exchanged emails with the<br/>
others who were mentioned, all veteran letterboxers, and, I think I<br/>
can speak for all involved. We felt that if we didn't do this and<br/>
emphasize the traditions associated with the game, the wrong<br/>
impression would have been given to the reading public and, sadly,<br/>
even more letterboxes would go missing. Doing this was truly a double<br/>
edged sword.<br/>
<br/>
Further, we invited the writer of the piece, Deirdre Van Dyk, to<br/>
Connecticut to letterbox with those of us in the East who had done<br/>
phone interviews with her. Deirdre graciously gave up her one day a<br/>
week off and joined us. Before we set one foot on a trail, we sat<br/>
with her at lunch and discussed in great detail the nuances of the<br/>
game and how playing it runs along a continuum from complete stealth<br/>
and anonymity to others who are much more open. Incidentally, in<br/>
advance of Deridre's coming to Connecticut and writing the piece, she<br/>
read Randy Hall's book. Most of us had several telephone<br/>
conversations with her and we emailed back and forth constantly<br/>
because she was committed to painting as accurate a picture as she<br/>
could. Shortly before publication, her editor reduced her allotted<br/>
space to 99 lines so she had to cut quite a bit of content from the<br/>
piece.<br/>
<br/>
While we all were letterboxing with Deirdre, we happened upon some<br/>
technical scenarios that, I feel, helped her understand how the game<br/>
is played and some of the issues we all face and discuss on the talk-<br/>
lists. We came upon a poorly hidden letterbox, some clues that were<br/>
written in such a way as to cause undesirable impact to the<br/>
environment and a box hidden in plain sight of a family gathering<br/>
that we decided to pass on. We took the time to point these things<br/>
out to her and I feel she achieved a more balanced perspective that<br/>
most letterboxers are sensitive to the environment and LNT, are<br/>
thoughtful and respectful people who would pass up a letterbox rather<br/>
than compromise its location to non-boxers.<br/>
<br/>
Whether the piece was 99 lines or 9 pages, it would have attracted<br/>
people to our beloved game who had both good and bad intentions,<br/>
some who will stay and become great and interesting players or others<br/>
who will try it, lose interest and fade away. In that regard, if<br/>
the "Time" article was to happen at all, ironically, we probably have<br/>
the writer's editor to thank for preventing too much from being<br/>
written about it. The downside is that regional media sources who<br/>
picked up on the piece are now clammoring for their own spin, as many<br/>
of you have already found out. Best kept secrets aren't secrets for<br/>
very long.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think we are all saddened by the loss of a letterbox, particularly<br/>
when it happens at the hand of man. While art is ephemeral, it still<br/>
smarts and makes us ask why anyone would be so thoughtless. This is<br/>
one reason so many of us harp "ad nauseum" on the importance of<br/>
rehiding a box carefully and making good choices about hiding spots.<br/>
These things need to be reiterated over and over somewhere so that<br/>
those who are new to the game of letterboxing follow on with respect<br/>
for the efforts by and hard work from every boxer who preceded them.<br/>
It's also just one reason why so many of us are not publishing our<br/>
clues any longer and making them WOM.<br/>
<br/>
Your comment about media people having their own agendas is true.The<br/>
nature of the press is that, in theory, it may strive for balance,<br/>
but the end result is always presented with a point of view. It was<br/>
extremely important for those of us who were involved with "Time" to<br/>
make sure that the article was as balanced as it could be. If it had<br/>
to happen at all, I, for one, am thankful to have worked with a<br/>
reporter who was generous of herself and her time, understood our<br/>
delimma and attempted to write about letterboxing as fairly as<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
Don and Gwen, I am very sorry for the loss of your letterboxes.<br/>

to have a full logbook within a few weeks. A couple of years, it<br/>
might only take a couple of days."<br/>
<br/>
Just to throw in my own two cents, here in Utah it still just like the<br/>
old days.  I can have a logbook sit for several months in a drive-by<br/>
location and still have no visitors. So I confess that here in Utah I<br/>
welcome new boxers with somewhat more enthusiasm.  Try to remember<br/>
that the rest of the country does not look like Connecticut. In the<br/>
entire state of Utah there are only 59 boxes on the LBna site, while<br/>
Connecticut must have most of the 10,000 boxes that are posted. Be it<br/>
a blessing or a curse!<br/>

Now I've got your attention, right?  =)  But seriously, I want to state at<br/>
the outset that these are just my opinions and aren't really directed at<br/>
anyone in particular.<br/>
<br/>
    I just wanted to share with all of you that -- gasp -- *I* am one of<br/>
those "news folks."  I'm a political reporter.  I'm a letterboxer.  I'm also<br/>
a Time newbie.  How about that?  (Wonder if I can pile on any more odious<br/>
categories.  Good thing I'm not a lawyer. ;)  )   I've been watching the<br/>
recent Time thread and am really perplexed by the distrust of the media<br/>
that's being talked about here.  I'm not saying reporters don't make<br/>
mistakes -- they do.  But by and large they're because of human foibles, not<br/>
because of some nefarious plot.  To ascribe such sinister motives to a noble<br/>
profession, especially one to which I've dedicated my life, is just more<br/>
than I can take without saying something.<br/>
<br/>
    I can't speak for everyone -- there are bad apples in every barrel --<br/>
but I and my colleagues all work long hours for relatively little pay for<br/>
mostly idealistic reasons.  If anything, a reporter's agenda -- if you want<br/>
to call it that -- is to make people in power of ALL PERSUASIONS answer for<br/>
the things they do.   It's an important job.  (Remember Watergate?<br/>
Iran-Contra?  Ernie Pyle?)  I'm just a regular old person with a job to do,<br/>
and so are my colleagues.  And contrary to what you'll hear from politicians<br/>
and pundits, reporters -- certainly the ones I know -- really don't have an<br/>
"agenda" except to do our jobs well, make a difference in peoples' lives,<br/>
and write something that people will want to read.<br/>
<br/>
    I'm not suggesting that it's wrong to be skeptical of news reports, or<br/>
to carefully examine what the media does.  In fact, it's ESSENTIAL that<br/>
every citizen do both because of how influential news can be.  But, please,<br/>
form your OWN opinions on this.  Have you read a newspaper and truly found<br/>
an article to be biased, independent of what some talking head or politician<br/>
said on CNN or FOXNews last night?  Here's a bit of perspective:  People in<br/>
power have always and will always criticize the media, because it is our job<br/>
to hold their feet to the fire.  Nobody likes to have someone look into what<br/>
they do, to have their dirty laundry aired (this is why people don't like<br/>
the police).  Be skeptical of them, too.  What is THEIR agenda when they<br/>
talk nebulously about the left-wing or right-wing media?  (Believe it or<br/>
not, I've been accused of being both -- guess I'm doing my job.)<br/>
<br/>
    To bring it back to the topic at hand, I can assure you that the Time<br/>
reporter had no agenda except to write an interesting piece.  Let's be real<br/>
here -- it was a softball article giving readers a glimpse into a very nice,<br/>
fun hobby, not examining a political campaign.  What agenda do you suppose<br/>
she had beyond reporting and writing something someone would want to read?<br/>
Just a question to ponder.<br/>
<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Time article and others<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I just popped into the SoCal list here in the KOA, Idaho Falls, Idaho<br/>
while we are on a letterboxing/shooting junket. Since this Newbie/Time topic<br/>
has come up I thought that I would give my perspective. We were contacted by<br/>
the Time  writer, but we chose not to respond. Not only do I think that the<br/>
game is better served by word of mouth, I have a great distrust of most news<br/>
folks as they will always follow THEIR agenda. When we started letterboxing<br/>
there was only 14 letterboxes in the state, and we tried to generate other<br/>
letterboxers by either word of mouth or with some articles in the<br/>
neighborhood papers. I noticed that everytime that an article was printed,<br/>
either in neighborhood papers or even in the Orange Co Register we would<br/>
lose letterboxes. After the Time article I think we have 8 confirmed missing<br/>
and clue pages pulled or edited, and another 5 that may have a problem?<br/>
Publicity for this game can be detrimental to the viability of the planted<br/>
letterbo xes. That is just the way it is. For those that only "Find" the<br/>
missing letterbox is an inconvenience. For those that "Plant" the missing<br/>
letterbox is more than that, and a little part of you is gone. We have<br/>
always attempted to replant one time when a box goes missing, and it usually<br/>
gets a better stamp than on the first plant, but if the box goes missing<br/>
again it doesn't get replaced. Examples would be "El Dorado's -Train,At Bat,<br/>
Wm Tells Target",and currently "Seal Beach's 101". Do we need publicity?<br/>
probably not, but since there is no way to stop it, try and replace your<br/>
loss with better stamps and when you plant remember that some of the finders<br/>
aren't as slick as they should be.<br/>
We just checked on one of our  letterboxes here in Idaho Falls- "Early<br/>
Hunters". Last year we planted it across the two lane highway from a lava<br/>
tube(cave) about 16 miles outside of Idaho Falls. Other letterboxers (2)<br/>
planted their letterboxes inside the very long lava tube. Now we thought<br/>
about it at the time, but figured that some one would discover boxes inside<br/>
the cave, and we were right. Upon entering the cave a few days ago we found<br/>
various letterboxing paraphernalia, boxes, baggies, and letterboxing notices<br/>
scattered about, and only one box had survived inside the cave. Now hiding a<br/>
box inside the cave is really cool(pun intended), but just getting folks to<br/>
the site is what we like to do. I can't imagine anyone stumbling upon our<br/>
letterbox in the other direction , the location isn't as neat, but the box<br/>
should last and finders can still go into the cave.<br/>
<br/>
.. No Buzzard we are delighted that someone has moved into Seal Beach. I<br/>
think we were able to get some of the best spots first. I haven't had the<br/>
opportunity to check out the clue sheet yet, and I'm for more plants. Well<br/>
as long as they aren't Geocacher s that grab your sites.<br/>
<br/>
Popping back out, helping to plant Idaho seeds.<br/>

I have dealt with many different types of reporters over the years, be they newspaper, television, magazine or what have you, and I have found the exact opposite to be true in many cases, with all manner of negative repercussions.<br/>
<br/>
They may not have an agenda starting out, but more often than not, they latch onto a facet of a topic that appeals to them and 'run with it', because they think it is more likely to get them published or aired...it is more sensationalistic....it's a better photo op...you name it.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, I was once interviewed by a reporter when I was a state park ranger. The article was supposed to be about the programs we offered for children in the park I worked at. Somehow she had gotten info on our salaries and then a simple question to me about why us environmental educators work for so little ("because we believe in what we are doing")turned into an article about how park rangers are disgruntled about their poor pay....when I had said nothing of the sort. Luckily my supervisors knew me better than that - otherwise I could have lost my job. <br/>
<br/>
Most of my experiences with reporters has shown me that because many reporters are plagued by their deadlines and their need to appeal to the masses (rather than tell the whole truth), they tend to do very poorly at 'getting the whole story' or 'telling all sides'or 'exposing these stories to the world' - political or otherwise. They tend to be hurried, superficial and impatient.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned that I need to tell reporters doing 'light' or 'family fun'-type stories exactly what they need to tell people and what not to put in.<br/>
e.g. "You MUST let your readers know that there is an admission fee" or "It is imperative that you tell your audience that letterboxing has a strong 'leave no trace' ethic". <br/>
<br/>
Certainly, there are great reporters out there, but my experiences have taught me not to wholly entrust a story to them. If we have a story to tell, it is OUR job to make sure it is told correctly. I'm not leaving it up to anyone else.<br/>

<br/>
Ryan hit it just right--the advertisers and, I say, the editors (those in<br/>
charge of "selecting" what people do and do not read) are usually the people<br/>
with<br/>
$$$ in their eyes. I'm sure the article in TIME held lots of marketing<br/>
value--notice the "Big Cats" issue on the stand now? Right when readers are<br/>
exhausted from election hype and war? Perhaps letterboxing functioned in a<br/>
similar fashion.<br/>
<br/>
An informed audience is the best we can hope for right now. So, I hope all<br/>
newbies join this listserv and learn about the community, say, "first-hand."<br/>

I once took a management course given by my employer,(before it was realized <br/>
that I had absolutely no career potential) and one of the subjects was dealing <br/>
with the press. The bullet points included things such as, In terms of money <br/>
and prestige journalism is second only to retail. The press are all angry <br/>
socialists, etc....  When I read these posts I just chuckled and recalled that <br/>
class.  After all there are worse things, such as journalists who went to law <br/>
school. <br/>
