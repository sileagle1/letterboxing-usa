problems good instraucions. "Canopy Rock" planted by the Drew Clan <br/>
also had good instructions and the box is in place and dry. Only <br/>
problem here is the ink pad falls out of it's plastic case but still <br/>
has ink and is usable. "Haley Farm SP" Planted by Bill Haalck and <br/>
John has no problems and also in fine condition. Good directions. We <br/>
had a great day at Haley Farm State Park and recomend it to other <br/>
letterboxers.....Chuck, Molly and Chickabirdie<br/>
