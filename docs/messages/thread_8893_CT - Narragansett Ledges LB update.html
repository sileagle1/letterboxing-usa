Yesterday I did boxes 1 &amp; 3 of the Narragansett Ledges series in <br/>
North Stongington (did not have time to get to the 2nd box; will save <br/>
for another time.)  <br/>
<br/>
Box 1 is in good shape.  The container for box 3 (the Wyassup Lake <br/>
Box) is damaged and leaks badly.  There were 2 log books in the box.  <br/>
The second log book is ok but the first log book is saturated with <br/>
water and mold and is falling apart.  I took it home to dry it out.  <br/>
What would you like me to do with this log book?  I can mail it to <br/>
you if you like. Also, the container to this box should be replaced.  <br/>
I can try to bring a new container the next time I am out in North <br/>
Stonington.  I heard you work in North Stonington so I thought maybe <br/>
you might be able to replace the container since you will be there <br/>
before I get there again.  Let me know.  I should be back out there <br/>
in another couple of weeks.<br/>
