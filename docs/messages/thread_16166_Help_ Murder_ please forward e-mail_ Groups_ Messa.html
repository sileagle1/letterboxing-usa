Okay, this callous response to a heartfelt cry for help proves what <br/>
some folks have alleged: that you, Ryan C., are in league with Hong <br/>
Kong brain police murderer. How else can you explain this trip up the <br/>
entire width of the US of A? Spreading brain probe, no feel, no use <br/>
dry battery, technology to unsuspecting letterboxers in Appalachia, <br/>
that is what the voices in MY head told me. <br/>
<br/>
Next thing you know (1*10**100D) more letterboxer buy gliding shoe <br/>
which have wheel in bottom! More (1*10**100D)letterboxer told to <br/>
cheese race! <br/>
<br/>
This letter may come as a surprise to you, but friend told me you are <br/>
reliable business person in USA. General Idi Amin (Dada) was <br/>
letterboxer and left unclaimed letterboxes in safety deposit box in <br/>
Nairobi bank totalling 1.75 million units of Master Carve (MC). If <br/>
you mail us (firm of JugglerMouse, Balthazar, and Raven) your logbook <br/>
and bank account number, I am empowered to transfer 351,205 <br/>
letterboxes to your account.<br/>
<br/>
May St. Brie, the patron saint in our crusade against cheeseracing, <br/>
pray for you,<br/>

That's because they probably have a small machine installed in their head, <br/>
