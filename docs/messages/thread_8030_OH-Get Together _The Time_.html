we can meet there UNLESS WE ARE HURTING THE PARK BY STANDING ON THE GRASS AND THEY THROW US OUT..  (LOL)<br/>
<br/>
 Time will be 10:30am.<br/>
<br/>
 Place in the park (Hummm)  Look for a RED Mustang with a RED Ba-Loon tied to it.  WHY!!  Because I do not know which picnic table I can get to in the morning, I can tell you it will be some where next the the KING Fisher Trail.<br/>
<br/>
 Also, Between now and the 6th of October, If you wish, Make a stamp just for the gathering and hide it in the park.  Team Jedi and Beagle Troop will have stamps hidden. If you do hide one and wish to e-mail us the clues, I will print them up and bring them with me so we can give everyone a copy.  <br/>
<br/>
 After the Gathering we/you can post them on the Letterboxing.org website for the people who could not make it to find later.<br/>
<br/>
 If you get a chance, Please E-Mail us how many will be attending with you so we can get an idea of how many to exspect.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks<br/>
