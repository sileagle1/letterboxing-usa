We also tried finding the box Sayreville and were unsuccessful, perhaps it warrants checking on.  I am afraid that you are probably right about the Panic attack box--it was not well hidden and it was only a matter of time before someone unscrupulous discovered it.<br/>

&gt; Traveling from Newark to Lakewood on Saturday, we stopped along the way to<br/>
&gt; hunt for two boxes. The first, MartianMaggot's letterbox at Kennedy Park in<br/>
&gt; Sayreville, NJ, completely eluded us. Although the clues are brief and the<br/>
&gt; hike simple, we were nevertheless unsuccessful in finding it (despite<br/>
&gt; spending a good deal of time poking around nearly every "double pine tree" in<br/>
&gt; the place). Our disappointment was short-lived when we sought out and found<br/>
&gt; the second box of the day, the "Crabbing Bridge" letterbox at Cheesequake<br/>
&gt; State Park. An interesting hike and a very nice stamp!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Two mystery boxes placed by New Jersey's Perfect Circle Letterboxing Guild<br/>
&gt; (which, BTW, has a terrific website) awaited us on Sunday. First up was<br/>
&gt; "Panic/Attack"; we were in the right town, in the right park, at the right<br/>
&gt; monument (worth the visit alone), but were unable to locate this box! After<br/>
&gt; scouring its resting spot (unmistakable from the clues), we reached the sad<br/>
&gt; conclusion that this letterbox must be missing from its perch. Perhaps<br/>
&gt; someone from PCLG can confirm whether or not this box is still in place.<br/>
&gt; Disappointed but undeterred, we headed to another, final resting place and<br/>
&gt; easily found the "Mooving Tale" letterbox. After wiping a tear or two from<br/>
&gt; our eyes, we stamped in and then proceeded on our way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All in all, we had another excellent roadtrip, made even more enjoyable by<br/>
&gt; those Jersey letterboxes. Many thanks to the "Jersey girls" and "Jersey boys"<br/>
&gt; who planted 'em!<br/>
