Here's how I mount my stamps:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/articles/00000012.php<br/>
So far, the results have been very good. I've recently started using <br/>
Gorilla Glue, and it seems to be really terrific for the task. The largest <br/>
issue with mounting stamps using this method is to make sure that the stamp <br/>
is glued in such a way that it provides a flat stamping surface on the <br/>
stamp. A gentle clamp after applying the Gorilla Glue can help, since this <br/>
glue expands after it's applied. (I cut off any excess around the edges <br/>
with a knife after it's dried.) You might think about aligning the wood <br/>
grain so that if it does warp, it pushes the center of the stamp outward -- <br/>
if it warps so that the sides of the stamp are pushed out, then you won't <br/>
get a good image in the middle of the stamp, but if the center is higher <br/>
than the edges, you can rock the stamp back and forth slightly to get a <br/>
good impression.<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">#1 I don't use mounting if the stamp is small and the material is 3/8" or more thick. When I use a backing, it's usually wood that is then varnished. I have heard good things from people that use material cut from a thin plastic cutting board, but haven't tried that myself. Sometimes you can find stamp mounts in a hobby store or buy an inexpensive stamp to reuse the backing.<br/>
<br/>
#2 I don't use cushion.<br/>
<br/>
#3 My stamps are usually pretty small to match my carving skill. I think they get a good impression, but probably not as good as if I used a cushion.<br/>
<br/>
#4 I use Elmer's Stix-All. It claims to be "Dishwasher Safe" which is what got my attention. No problems with it so far.<br/>
<br/>
#5 I've heard NOT to use GOOP, as it warps the stamp material.<br/>

&gt; #1  Do you mount your stamps on a ridgid backing?<br/>
<br/>
One inch thick pine or alder.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; #2 If you mount your stamps, do you use a cushion inbetween?<br/>
<br/>
No<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; #3  If you mount directly to wood, do you get a good impression?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I never leave a good impression, but my stamps do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; #4 What adhesive do you use?<br/>
<br/>
Goop- Household. I use PZ Kut, and to prepare the stamp for glue I <br/>
clean the back of the stamp with Acetone. I probably lose a few <br/>
brain cells when cleaning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; #5 Is there an adhesive to definately NOT use?<br/>
<br/>
Any waterbased glue.<br/>
<br/>
There is a good possibility that the stamp backers will warp if in a <br/>
wet climate. Here in Kernville we aren't sure what wet is. If the <br/>
backers do warp the finder can apply the page to the stamp after <br/>
inking rather than applying the stamp to the page.<br/>
