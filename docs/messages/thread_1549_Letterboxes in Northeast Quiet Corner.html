clicking on the dot next to Hartford on the CT map.  I dont know of any in<br/>
Pomfret, Woodstock, Brooklyn or anywhere like that.  There is also a great<br/>
series of boxes in Union.  Also a couple in Scotland.  Good Luck<br/>

&gt; Does anyone know of some hiking areas in the Northeast Quiet Corner of<br/>
&gt;CT where there would be letterboxing and how I would obtain the clues?<br/>
&gt;I referred to the map at http://www.letterboxing.org/ but there was no<br/>

I placed a letterbox in pomfret on 10/15 however I haven't posted the<br/>
cluse so the only one who has found it has been my mom and her friend,<br/>
and no I didn't help them. Actually we gave them no clues at all because<br/>
we wanted to see how accurate our clues were. I'll post the clues<br/>
tonight so that everyone can check it out. It's really cool about 2<br/>
hours round trip, just under 3 miles, and fairly easy except one large<br/>
hill. Also it's within a few minutes driving so that I can go back and<br/>
check on them often. Also if you know the area, or if you get a trail<br/>
map. You can drive back and check them to. There's 2 boxes and their in<br/>
Mashamoquet State Park. Sorry for taking so long to post it, but I'm a<br/>
college student and I work in retail. all of October was ordering, and<br/>
now it's selling and finals. Fun, Fun, Fun.<br/>
Well talk to ya tonight. <br/>
