                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh what I day I had today!  <br/>
<br/>
I started out by finding Rec Park letterbox in Columbia, which is a great <br/>
short hike... However, I'm wondering if the Columbian Bugs know that just about <br/>
200 feet away, there is another box?????  So if any of you are out boxing, <br/>
bring those other Columbia clues with you, so you don't have to the same place <br/>
again from the other side of the preserve!<br/>
<br/>
My day went downhill from there!  I went out to find Willimantic River Trail, <br/>
and on my way to the box, what do I find???  A burnt animal (probably a deer) <br/>
carcass right smack dab in the middle of the trail!  UGH did it stink!  Then <br/>
to make matters more interesting, when I got to the box, the box had been <br/>
totally trashed (looks like by an animal) and the logbook had been chewed apart!  <br/>
I have pulled the box for Chuck so don't go out looking for it!<br/>
<br/>
Then, I went to Camp Exploration in Windham to find the first two boxes <br/>
totally ruined by rain and animals.  I have also pulled those boxes and have <br/>
refreshed them, however, I have not replaced them yet, so don't go looking!  BTW... <br/>
I couldn't find the third box, and wonder if through all of the clear cutting <br/>
that happened, that the box was located and thrown away.  Since the boxes are <br/>
(I think) orphaned, I don't know who to contact concerning that.  <br/>
<br/>
After that, I went and found, successfully, the North Windham Station <br/>
letterbox, and it was in good order (thank goodness!).  <br/>
<br/>
Since I had Chuck, Chickabirdie and Molly's box in the car, I thought I would <br/>
drop it off at their house.  I called but left a message, but by the time I <br/>
got there, Chickabirdie was home and I got to have a pleasant conversation with <br/>
her, Molly, Max, and Lily.  Daisy decided that I was a stranger and was <br/>
hiding somewhere.  (BTW... Max, Lily and Daisy are the three cats).<br/>
<br/>
After a nice chat, I went on and found Eternal Love and all of the John Wayne <br/>
Series in Coventry, on my way home.  By the time I found the last John Wayne <br/>
box, the rain was coming down in buckets.  Of course, when I got back to my <br/>
car, I didn't see my car!  It was because somehow (even in gear and on what I <br/>
thought was a level parking spot... I have a manual transmission car) my car <br/>
decided to cross the street and fall into a small gully on the opposite side of <br/>
the street!  Thank goodness it didn't hit another car, or person, or a tree.  <br/>
It just has a scratch on its front (brand new) bumper.  Thankfully, only one <br/>
wheel was in the gully, and I was able to get the car out safely.  <br/>
<br/>
I decided at that point that I had had enough excitement for one day and <br/>
called it quits.  Lets hope tomorrow's boxing experience is much less eventful.  <br/>
Hopefully I'll find some boxes without the hoopla!<br/>

misfortunes, obviously, but this was a good one for my boyfriend. <br/>
I cant tell you how many times we go out looking for a letterbox <br/>
and he expects the clouds to part and the sun to shine sweetly <br/>
on our faces and little birds come out to help carry our things and <br/>
small little creatures to guide us to the letterbox where you see a <br/>
golden light gleaming from the box (like something in Indiana <br/>
Jones) and all the world is happy. NOT!! He has the patience of a <br/>
2 year old sometimes and I just appreciate the fact that I can tell <br/>
him this story so he doesn't think that letterboxing is easy for <br/>
everyone but us. Like we're some kind of letterboxing misfits!! <br/>
Anyway this one put it into perspective for him. So thanks!!<br/>
