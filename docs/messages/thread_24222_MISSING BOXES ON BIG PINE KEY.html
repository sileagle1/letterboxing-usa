We decided to go box hunting Saturday 7th at Big Pine Key, which is<br/>
about 30 miles south of where we are in the keys.There were two boxes<br/>
here according to the maps.<br/>
<br/>
One was in the deer key refuge at a location called the"Blue Hole".  we<br/>
are familiar with this location because we have been there many times. <br/>
We followed the clues, which are a little vague, but we are reasonably<br/>
sure we looked in the right place.  The box is missing.   we did meet a<br/>
family from England though, and enjoyed talking to them.<br/>
<br/>
The other box was located near the "Big Pine Flea Market".  It was late<br/>
in the day when we looked for this one and the market was closed.  if<br/>
you searched for this during market hours it would be very difficult to<br/>
be descreet as this is very crowded area.  The clues were more detailed<br/>
for this one and we are sure the box is missing.<br/>
<br/>
we have looked for eight boxes now and only found three.  not a good<br/>
average.  we are heading back to Ohio next week and we will resume our<br/>
hunting back in the Buckeye State.<br/>
