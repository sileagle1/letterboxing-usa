                    <div class="plaintext-content">Letterboxing is funny. Boxes mostly disappear but sometimes they <br/>
resurface. Pandora planted the original St. Patrick's Fliers on St. <br/>
Patrick's Day 2003. Awhile later, the box seemed to disappear. Pandy, <br/>
being the never say die kinda girl, recarved the stamp. This next one <br/>
showed how far she had progressed in her carving. She hid that stamp <br/>
in a different location but in the same area.<br/>
<br/>
Now the strange part of the story, Princess Lea came to the area in <br/>
August and found St. Patrick's Fliers. When she showed it to me, I <br/>
noticed it was the original stamp! So, we went back to the box where <br/>
she told us she and Sleepy Cat had found it. Sure enough, it was the <br/>
original. Princess Lea had earlier clues. I gave her the newer clues <br/>
and she found the second (replacement) box, too.<br/>
<br/>
So now there are two St. Patrick's Fliers boxes. How about them <br/>
apples? Clues have been updated at letterboxing.org <br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of you can find both the boxes when you come here for the <br/>
October 4th, SLO Stamping in the Meadow.<br/>
