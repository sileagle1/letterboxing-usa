Yes, we counted our HHs released,or new HHs that we created in our <br/>
placed count.  Not when you place an existing HH at another box, <br/>
though.<br/>

Wanda and Pete still maintain their hitchhiker site.  If you wrote to <br/>
them, they will eventually answer back.  I don't think they do it on <br/>
a daily basis.  I think he updates the site when he has time.  If you <br/>
have an image of the hitchhiker on a webpage somewhere, they'll link <br/>
the listing to it if you want them to.  It's a great service and I <br/>
think we owe them a big thank you!  A link to the site is in the <br/>
FAQ's on the main site but I think their email is <br/>
wandaandpete@yahoo.com - hope this helps!<br/>

I'm sure they will answer your email. The're out boxing quite a bit. If you start your own HH, you count it as a plant but never count passsing along someone elses.....Chuck and Molly<br/>

That is the site I have for the Hitchhiker List. <br/>
<br/>
And yes, I count my HHs as placed boxes, but, no rules, right?<br/>
