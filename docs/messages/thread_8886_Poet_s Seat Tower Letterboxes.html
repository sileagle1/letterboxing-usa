Greenfield, Massachusetts<br/>
Adam Orth<br/>
htro@valinet.com<br/>
first placed July 2002, but not posted until October 2002.<br/>
<br/>
 Hidden away in western Massachusetts is the sleepy town of<br/>
Greenfield.  Once an industrial giant known as "Tap Town,"<br/>
Greenfield's current claim to fame is over-the-top property taxes and<br/>
its rejection of Wal-Mart. One of its most visible landmarks is Poet's<br/>
Seat Tower, which stands on cliffs overlooking the town. In times gone<br/>
by, residents used to hike up there to write poetry. <br/>
<br/>
Now, you can too, thanks to the three boxes I've hidden along one of<br/>
the many trails near the tower. You can bring poems with you -- as I<br/>
did -- or trust to inspiration. Either way, please leave something for<br/>
others to read.<br/>
<br/>
The tower is at the east end of town, accessible from Interstate 91 by<br/>
taking exit 26, entering the rotary and heading east on Route 2A. This<br/>
takes you though a traffic light, into lovely downtown Greenfield,<br/>
through a second traffic light, past the YMCA and the post office and<br/>
to the end of Main Street. Here the road splits, bear right. You will<br/>
drive a winding path but stay on the main road and then climb upward<br/>
to a stop sign and Mountain Road. Take a right and then prepare for an<br/>
almost immediate left into the bottom parking lot for Poet's Seat<br/>
Tower. There is a paved road that will take you right up to the tower,<br/>
but that's cheating. Park and get out. In winter and at night the gate<br/>
is locked.<br/>
<br/>
Plan for 45 minutes to find all three boxes. If you keep a steady<br/>
pace, the whole trip takes about an hour. Bring bug dope.  Unless<br/>
it's<br/>
winter, you'll need it. <br/>
<br/>
Box number 1<br/>
Proceed through the gate on the paved road that goes up to the tower.<br/>
(Note: There might be maps on the sign near the gate. Snag one,<br/>
they're useful.) Just walk up the paved road a ways and look for a<br/>
wooden trail sign on your right, nailed to a tree. You should also see<br/>
a white diamond blazed on a tree marking the trail. <br/>
<br/>
Head down the White Diamond Trail. It will descend a ways, and then<br/>
turn to the left. Keep your eye out for a large standing snag -- or<br/>
dead tree -- close to the trail. Which side, you may ask? Well,<br/>
there's only one right answer to that question. <br/>
<br/>
(I'm 6 foot tall and counted 104 strides to the snag. My wife is<br/>
5-foot 2-inches tall and she counted 172 steps to the box)<br/>
<br/>
Once you come abreast of the snag, you'll notice its top has broken<br/>
off and fallen to the ground nearby. I wonder what's hidden under it?<br/>
<br/>
Box number 2<br/>
Having found the first box, head on down the trail. It will seem to go<br/>
on forever. It doesn't. You might notice passing a side trail headed<br/>
uphill. Ignore it and stay on the main trail. You'll likely hear the<br/>
river and get scolded by chipmunks along the way. Ignore them. They<br/>
have no idea where the boxes are. You're looking for a stone wall that<br/>
crosses the trail. The box is hidden in the wall, on the uphill side.<br/>
Which side you ask? Remember that right answer last time? Well, that<br/>
answer won't do this time. <br/>
<br/>
Be careful. There's a section of old barb wire near the wall. Walk<br/>
uphill along the wall until you're halted by a clump of small trees.<br/>
You are hot, very hot.<br/>
<br/>
Box number 3<br/>
Having found the second box, walk over the wall and head uphill along<br/>
it. You are now on a trail blazed with what I say is orange and my<br/>
wife says is yellow. Continue up this trail heading to your left and<br/>
crossing the wall again. After a while, you'll hit a trail that looks<br/>
like a highway in comparison. This is the Blue Trail. Take a left on<br/>
to it. Proceed up the trail until you come to a Y-intersection marked<br/>
by a low stump. Head to your right and you will encounter a rocky<br/>
surface and see open sky. Keep an eye out for another dead tree off to<br/>
your left as you walk up the rocks. It's in a small clearing<br/>
surrounded by trees, but you likely can't miss it. If you walk up the<br/>
rock far enough to see Greenfield spread out before you, you've gone<br/>
too far. In the fall, you'll see the tower at about the right moment<br/>
to look left and see the dead tree. Please return the bark I've used<br/>
to hide this box's hole at the base of the tree.<br/>
<br/>
(A word of caution about this third box: There was a dragon nearby.<br/>
Well, OK, it was a garter snake. Either way, extract this box with<br/>
care, or make someone who loves you do it for you. Last time I<br/>
checked, the garter snake was gone. If a snake comes back, tell me and<br/>
I'll move the box so as not to deny it a home.) <br/>

family e-mailed me so I know there's haiku waiting for me when I do<br/>
make it back up to the tower. <br/>
