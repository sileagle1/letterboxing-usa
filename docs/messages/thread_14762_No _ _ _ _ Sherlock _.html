I wish I could have attended, but I think I was on the Moose River camping by a waterfall during the event.  This morning though I took a run over to No _ _ _ _ Sherlock ! and I'm sad to say there is no Sherlock anymore.  I found the box open near the stump with no stamp or journal. I searched the area hoping that a animal my have dragged it off, but couldn't find the box contents. The park is great though and had a nice walk around the pond with Grady (Grateful Dog, my lab) I hope Teamgreendragon can replace it or add another it to the park is a jewel.<br/>
