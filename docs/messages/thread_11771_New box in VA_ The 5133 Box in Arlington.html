The 5133 Box<br/>
<br/>
Lacey Woods Park<br/>
<br/>
Arlington, VA (Arlington County)<br/>
<br/>

For many years we lived a house near this park. 5133 was torn down shortly after we moved out. Fortunately, the developer left a beautiful old tree with a tire swing that was in our backyard. The branch had grown around the rope at the top. We have left this box to commemorate this tree and the fun we had in our North Arlington home. This is a quick box to find  enjoy a brief walk in the woods!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lacey Woods is a small park in Arlington at the corner of George Mason and Washington Ave.<br/>
<br/>
Park on Frederick Street (parallel to George Mason) across from 12th Street North. Enter the park on the gravel path with the green gate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Walk towards the playground and look for a tree with a double trunk on your right. Take the small path to the right just behind this tree. After a short walk you will come to a small intersection. Go left, on the left side of the green fence.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When you see a very cool knobby tree with the yellow X, stay to the right. At the next fork in the path, go right. You will encounter a fallen tree with a pathway cut through the middle. Keep walking through the woods in the same general direction until you get to a gravel path. Turn right.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As you approach a circle of benches, look for some larger stones set into the gravel paths right-hand side. There will be either 3 or 4, depending on what you consider larger. At the middle one (or ones), turn right into the woods and look for a fallen tree. Follow this tree until it ends and you see a burned out stump and another log. Follow this log to the left to its end.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At 11:00 look for yet a large fallen tree stump. The box is buried under the base near a holly bush. Have fun!<br/>
