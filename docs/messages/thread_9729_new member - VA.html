I happen to know their are several nice boxes in Arlington, ;-)  And <br/>
in case you didn't know there are three indoor boxes in the area: one <br/>
in a library in Loudon County, a temporary one in Pentagon City Mall <br/>
and really cool one in the Smithsonian castle.<br/>

&gt; No rules! That's good! The box we found was the one at Glencarlyn. <br/>
&gt; Didn't stamp in. We don't have stamps yet! The upcoming holiday has <br/>
&gt; us busy.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi, welcome to letterboxing. Too bad you had to see the talk list <br/>
&gt; in one of it's darker  discussions. This happens every so often and <br/>
&gt; usually doesn't have anything to do with the last arguement. It's <br/>
&gt; best to just stay out of those. Most of the time it's pretty tame <br/>
&gt; stuff. Just remember it's a hobby and there are no official rules <br/>
or <br/>
&gt; organization. Wishing you a good time and welcome to <br/>
&gt; letterboxing..Chuck and Molly in CT<br/>
