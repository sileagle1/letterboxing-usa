BOX NAME: Heart of Lake Washington Box<br/>
LOCATION:  Mercerdale Park, Mercer Island<br/>
NEAREST CITY:  Seattle, WA<br/>
COUNTY: King<br/>
DIFFICULTY: Easy clues, easy hike.  Kid-friendly.<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:<br/>
 From I-5, take the I-90 East exit and follow I-90 to exit 7A (77th SE). <br/>
  Take a right from the end of the exit onto 77th, and follow it 3-4 <br/>
blocks to where it dead-ends.  In front of you is the park. :)  Park <br/>
nearby, and find the place where 77th meets 33rd, (where 77th <br/>
dead-ended).  You're here. :)<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
Find the recycling center.  To the right is a circular garden, and at <br/>
the back, a set of stairs that starts the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the trail up the stairs.  Continue until the stairs split into <br/>
two, and take the left fork.  Follow the path down and to the right, and <br/>
continue on the gravel path until it ends.<br/>
<br/>
Turn left onto the concrete car-path, and follow it down the hill until <br/>
you get to the stone road on the left side.  Turn that way and follow <br/>
the road until you get to the sidewalk and follow it around a slight <br/>
left.  (There may be a fence in your way, if so, follow the perimeter <br/>
around.)<br/>
<br/>
You will come upon a sign on your left side that explains the rules of <br/>
the concrete jungle.  Go past the sign to the very back corner of the <br/>
cement.  There will be a wood-chipped path to your right.  Follow it.<br/>
<br/>
Go leftish on the path.  You'll see a bench on your left side.  Go <br/>
forward to the Y (several steps), and to right to the next bench.<br/>
<br/>
Facing the bench, look to your right.  There's a cut piece of a log. <br/>
Facing it, there's another wood piece on its left side.  Move it, and <br/>
the box is under the log in a hollowed-out space.<br/>
<br/>
This is a high-traffic area, so please make sure to replace the wood <br/>
chunk over the log hollow when you replace the box!  Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
