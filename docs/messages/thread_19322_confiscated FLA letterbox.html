Rules and regulations governing the Tibet-Butler Preserve prohibit <br/>
this type of organized activity.  It was only discovered today--June <br/>
29, 2004 after being placed in January of this year.  Your box is <br/>
being removed from the property as no permission was asked for its <br/>
placement.  Please refrain from letterboxing at this site and all <br/>
other County pards in Orange County.  Failure to comply may result in <br/>
legal action.<br/>

We have this arguement about whether or not to consult the management <br/>
whenever we place a box in a park or preserve, but this is our first <br/>
confiscation. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dang, we loved that box! That was our favorite find in FL. Great <br/>
stamp, great clues, great walk. It was also my favorite facility. I <br/>
remember that the park and facilities were *extremely* well cared-<br/>
for, so I guess that's one reason for their concern. The staff were <br/>
all very friendly while we were there. I imagine that it was the <br/>
combination of a) being an incredibly careful caretaker and 2) being <br/>
kept out of the secret is what set someone off.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully in six months or so, after they've cooled off and forgotten <br/>
how upset they were, some charismatic and cheerful letterboxer can <br/>
approach the management again about the idea. They seemed like the <br/>
sort who would welcome this kind of activity, if they could supervise <br/>
the placement and watch over the environmental impact of a box.<br/>
