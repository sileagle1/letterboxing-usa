	 This is "Budster2" with some information about the hidden "Bean Box" up<br/>
there in the Vacation State of Maine which is  about a 6 1/2  hour drive<br/>
from Boiceville,NY.<br/>
We just got back to it after a year a few days ago and was amazed to find<br/>
out all the fun that was shared by those that stamped in. On the same day<br/>
we checked it , there was a stamp in! We just missed seeing other<br/>
letterboxers! We found out some  other interesting things too. Maybe it's<br/>
not the 5th rock that it is supposed to be hidden under. I counted 4 from<br/>
one end and 8 from the other.<br/>
	Special thanks  to those that added the extra zip-lock bags to protect<br/>
it in the adverse weather. The box was in great shape all we did was add<br/>
two pens to it.<br/>
	 So many stamps with so many happy lber's - even on the rainy days ,<br/>
left us with a good feeling. <br/>
	So many that the log book was half full and it's one of those "FAT"<br/>
little spiral books, by next year at this time we will have to replace it<br/>
with a new one. Wonder what you do with a filled up log book? Suppose it<br/>
should be kept in the box to be shared with all. <br/>
	That's it for now.... Budster of the Catskills<br/>
