<br/>
Can you say anything about how the AQ minimum find feature works?  I have a friend who keeps referring to it.  She's wondering how many boxes we have to find before more clues "magically" appear...  Or at least that's how it seems to me.  Will we still see boxes listed, but get messages that we don't have enough finds to see the clues, or will the boxes be hidden from us until we reach the magic number?  What is the magic number--or are there different levels?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are such things as WOM (word of mouth) clues that are basically passed<br/>
from person to person, either by meeting up with each other, say, on the<br/>
trail, or via private email, or passed out at gatherings, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But folks also post clues online elsewhere than LbNA and atlasquest (which I<br/>
assume are the two sites you're referring to).<br/>
<br/>
Some folks, like me, post clues on their own website or on their own blog.<br/>
<br/>
Some folks have their own yahoogroup for the purpose of putting clues in the<br/>
files section for the members who have subscribed.<br/>
<br/>
Some folks belong to the regional letterboxing yahoogroup in their area and<br/>
post clues to their boxes in the files sections of those groups.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of ways to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I went to putting them on my own website because I wanted them to still be<br/>
"public" enough for anyone to find them without having to subscribe to a<br/>
yahoogroup but I wanted to cut down on the number of people who found the<br/>
clues because maintenance was becoming more and more difficult due to more<br/>
and more negligence, vandalism, etc.  It's helped dramatically, since for<br/>
many of my boxes the clues weren't all that difficult.....they were kinda of<br/>
geared to newbies and/or families with younger children.....and there were<br/>
just too many folks finding them and hence increasing the risk of tragedy.<br/>
I'm thinking this year of putting a bunch on letterboxing.org but with<br/>
muuuuch more difficult clues.<br/>

Now I only know of 2 sites to list letterboxes in North America, and I<br/>
know some people don't post finds, but do people hide letterboxes<br/>
without posting clues somewhere?<br/>

Hi!  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can you say anything about how the AQ minimum find feature works?  I have a friend who keeps referring to it.  She's wondering how many boxes we have to find before more clues "magically" appear...  Or at least that's how it seems to me.  Will we still see boxes listed, but get messages that we don't have enough finds to see the clues, or will the boxes be hidden from us until we reach the magic number?  What is the magic number--or are there different levels?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

Interesting about the crack pipe.  A friend and I were doing a series of five boxes once.  Two of the boxes were reversed, and we found a bong in the hollow log by one of them...<br/>

&gt; Hi!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can you say anything about how the AQ minimum find feature works?  <br/>
I have a friend who keeps referring to it.  She's wondering how many <br/>
boxes we have to find before more clues "magically" appear...  Or at <br/>
least that's how it seems to me.  Will we still see boxes listed, <br/>
but get messages that we don't have enough finds to see the clues, <br/>
or will the boxes be hidden from us until we reach the magic <br/>
number?  What is the magic number--or are there different levels?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt;  Word of mouth.? I have a large series in Ohio with clues I <br/>
passed out at an <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; event or to others I knew were experienced.? After this past <br/>
years rash of lost <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; or vandalized boxes, many folks chose to encrypt clues or to <br/>
keep them hidden.?? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Parents read about LBNA in magazines and then proceed to take <br/>
their young child <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; out to wreck havoc on boxes until they are bored with the idea. <br/>
Bored angsty <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; teens also wreck havoc should they stumble upon the easily <br/>
obtained clues on <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; LBNA, for that reason, many of us opted for AQ's minimum find <br/>
feature instead.? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The only boxes I've ever lost have been earlier plants on LBNA.<br/>

i was on amazon and found some herbal tobacco. i like to smoke a <br/>
pipe on ocassion and thought some blueberry, or raspberry might be <br/>
nice. but it was for a hookah. i thought a pipe is a pipe, the only <br/>
difference is what you smoke in it. and i thought a hooka was like a <br/>
bong (of course i knew that was. 20 years in the navy? oh please)<br/>
so i buy this stuff. it comes in, and i'm looking forward to a nice <br/>
flavored smoke. stuff looked the leftovers of making jelly. i wrote <br/>
to the people, and found out for a hooka pipe, you need to place a <br/>
charcoal in it, and smoke thru the charcoal, then the water.<br/>
doesn't it seem that after all that time in the service, several <br/>
trips overseas, etc i would have picked that up? nope.<br/>
so anyone going to the downeast tattoo show, that interested in the <br/>
hooka stuff, come see the crazy indian :)<br/>
<br/>
(yes it's off topic, but i thought it was funny)<br/>

&gt; next it'll be lsd sheets to stamp on(make sure you only take one or<br/>
&gt; you'll never get out of the woods)lmao<br/>

&gt; &gt; Interesting about the crack pipe.  A friend and I were doing a<br/>
&gt; series of five boxes once.  Two of the boxes were reversed, and we<br/>
&gt; found a bong in the hollow log by one of them...<br/>
