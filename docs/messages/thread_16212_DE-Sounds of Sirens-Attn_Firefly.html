alive and well as of 10/5/03. Team PresSinOn took a trip to the beach <br/>
again this weekend and found it along with the Seaside Nature Trail <br/>
and the Cape Henlopen Devil. We found the other Henlopen boxes a few <br/>
weeks ago. <br/>
Anyway, the reason for posting is to let you know that the log book <br/>
for Sounds of Sirens is full. We didn't have a spare one on us, but <br/>
we took a few pages from one of our logbooks to log in, and leave a <br/>
HH (I only mention the HH as an incentive to get people to come visit <br/>
DE. LOL). The next finder has nothing to stamp into unless they have <br/>
a spare book or some spare pages. <br/>
Just thought I'd let ya know.<br/>

We hope to head down to Bethany Beach and Dagsboro before it gets too <br/>
cold here, so we'll take an extra log with us and stop there on the <br/>
way. If someone gets there before us though, feel free to replace the <br/>
log if you have one. It'll still be a nice excuse for us to stop on <br/>
Rehoboth Ave. for a bit. :)<br/>
