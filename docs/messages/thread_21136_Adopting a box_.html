<br/>
I'm down in the DC area for Christmas and wanted to get as many of the boxes down here as I can before I go home.  As I posted a couple days ago, I wasn't able to get the clues to Mr. Jefferson's microbox, and Scarab was nice enough to find them for me.  His guess was that the Forest Frogs have stopped letterboxing, since their page no longer exists.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm hoping to go look for this box tomorrow.  If it in fact still exists, I'd like to adopt it.  If there is no way to get in contact with the original placer, how do I do this?  Since the placers do not have a website anymore, do I assume that they do not maintain the box anymore?<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions?  I don't want to irk anyone, but I'd hate to see a box go un-looked for (for lack of a better phrase... yeah, I'm a teacher...) if it's out there, you know?<br/>

I'm sticking my nose in, but it may be to a useful purpose. I went to the Frogs listing in search for boxes and found that 5 of their letterboxes have clue sheets listed through the LBNA site, and the others were apparantly listed on their own site with a link to the LBNA listing. While the 5 that are listed, and were listed there in 2002, seem to be viable clue sheets. The others that are listedhas the link to them broken and are obviously not viable.<br/>
If I were you I would try to make every attempt to contact them through "contact the placer", or through their address. I would search through the members listing to try to find their address. Since the clues are listed and not dwelling in the basement, then they still might be somewhat active letterboxers that just aren't answering their phone or are on an extended  trip. You could also peruse the basement to see if any of their letterboxes show up there. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-basement .<br/>

Don't think of it as butting in at all.  I posted it on the list because I wanted feedback.  :)<br/>
<br/>
The first step is that tomorrow I'm going to see if the box is still out there.  And if it is, I'll take your advice and see if I can contact them somehow through letterboxing.org.  They may not realize that the clues are inaccessable. :)<br/>

Thank you Chrissy for offering to adopt a box.  It is sad when <br/>
letterboxers loose interest in the hobby and boxes go "un-looked-<br/>
after".  I'm sure this happens all the time.  Then boxes become just <br/>
so much litter on the landscape.<br/>
<br/>
I have adopted several boxes and you are doing the right thing.  <br/>
Make reasonable attempts to contact the original owners, verify that <br/>
the box is in place, then contact the web masters to have it changed <br/>
to your name.  As you can see from my clues, I give credit to the <br/>
original placers.<br/>
