    Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow<br/>
    When in the snow, in the snow, in the snow!<br/>
My official answer is YES! We must take in the hazard factor. So the <br/>
equation is Blizzard, Hurricane, Earthquake, Great Mudpuddles etc. <br/>
plus finding a box equals two. Very simple, actually.<br/>
