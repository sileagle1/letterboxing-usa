                    <div class="plaintext-content">Martha arrived in Mass. on Friday just before the snow.  She has been <br/>
anxiously watching the storm in hopes that it will subside long <br/>
enough for her to move south and away from the large piles of snow.  <br/>
The weathermen give us hope that she will be able to depart for NC on <br/>
Monday.  In the meantime she has been supervising the Christmas <br/>
decorating and baking.  She has even discussed making snow candy.  We <br/>
have enjoyed her stay immensely!<br/>
