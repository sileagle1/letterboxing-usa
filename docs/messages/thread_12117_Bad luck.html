two times he has gone with me, we did not find the box! I keep <br/>
telling him this is fun, but I don't think he believes me. Yesterday <br/>
we looked for the Marblehead Lighthouse box. Great clues, we had to <br/>
do math and practice my new compass skills. It was very challenging, <br/>
but I was confident and excited we found the right spot. But we <br/>
couldn't find the box. I'm not sure if it is missing, if I'm not <br/>
figuring the location correctly, or if my husband is bad luck! (LOL) <br/>
I might head back out today to take another look. It was found as <br/>
recently as February.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, today he went with me to plant my first box. He was a little <br/>
more excited about doing this. He used to play Dungeons and Dragons, <br/>
so I thought he would be good at picking hiding spots and writing <br/>
clues. I was right about the hiding spot.<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to have someone try it to see if the clues make sense, <br/>
then I'll post them. Should be just a few days.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have someone who brings them bad luck?<br/>

Most of the time I can't find letterboxes is when I'm introducing <br/>
other hikers to the hobby.  It's happened twice, now.  I've met <br/>
people on the trail who get really excited about letterboxing (after <br/>
I discuss the hobby with them and see if it appeals to them or not &amp; <br/>
determine whether they'll keep the hiding spot a secret--sometimes I <br/>
invite them to look for the next box with me) and then we'll attempt <br/>
the box and it typically is the one that's difficult to find, a bit <br/>
off trail that might 'damage' the area a bit (not good for applying <br/>
the 'leave no trace' principle), or the box is downright missing.  I <br/>
usually leave a bit embarrassed and frustrated...  Hopefully, if <br/>
they're really interested, they attempt the hobby at another time!<br/>
