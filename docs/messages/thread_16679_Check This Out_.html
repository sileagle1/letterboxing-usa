I agree such posts shouldn't be tolerated (and the post in question <br/>
was rightly deleted), but as long as they show up, you don't have to <br/>
fall for it.  It's pretty obvious when there's a spammer at work.  <br/>
Just keep your eyes open for them instead of falling into their <br/>
traps.  That just gives them incentive to continue doing it.<br/>
