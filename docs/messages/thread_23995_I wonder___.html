Thats right, there are no rules... but, that also means that you <br/>
shouldn't be shoving you own rules down everyone elses throat.<br/>
<br/>
If they don't want to post boxes on the internet that is fine.  But <br/>
don't go crying that other people do, and further use those resources to <br/>
get clues themselves.  What is it?  Either the internet is good or not.<br/>

The discussion about finding boxes without the clues is an interesting diversion.  I know of an area park which has had a 20-box series planted in it for over a year now for which clues have never been posted.  As it's on the way to the Christmas tree farm we go to, I just may pop in there next weekend and try my luck -- should help even more that I have found several other boxes by the planters and am familiar with their MO.<br/>

  I've never been successful with "I don't have the clues but I know there's a box in this park somewhere"--although I found the most creative geocache I've ever seen that way (it was a hand-sized rubber frog stuck in a split in a tree).  Heck, with some people's boxes (naming no nominal list owners' names) I can HAVE the clues &amp; know I'm within 30 paces of the box and still not find it, repeatedly....  20 in one park would be good odds, though!<br/>

I had the clues to one of Happy Hippo's boxes but was obviously reading them<br/>
very very wrong because no matter how many different ways I tried it, I<br/>
couldn't follow the clues.  Couldn't get 'em to fit.  I figured there was<br/>
probably something very simple that I was missing.  So I took a stab at<br/>
where I thought the end result might be and started searching.  Lo &amp; behold<br/>
I found the box.   But I was still really bummed that I couldn't get the<br/>
gist of those clues.  So on another day when I had more time, I went back<br/>
and, knowing where the box was, I worked the clues backwards to figure out<br/>
where I'd gone wrong.  It had just really bugged me.<br/>
<br/>
But I've never just come across either a letterbox or a geocache purely by<br/>

Hey Mapsurfer, good to see you poke your head up -- watch out for flying<br/>
rutabagas though.<br/>
<br/>
The discussion about finding boxes without the clues is an interesting<br/>
diversion.  I know of an area park which has had a 20-box series planted in<br/>
it for over a year now for which clues have never been posted.  As it's on<br/>
the way to the Christmas tree farm we go to, I just may pop in there next<br/>
weekend and try my luck -- should help even more that I have found several<br/>
other boxes by the planters and am familiar with their MO.<br/>

At the end of the day we all have our own motivations. What's yours?<br/>
I hate to hike, I hate to walk but I love being in the woods. I use the <br/>
letterboxes as a carrot ( who said keep food away from them LOL). I have searched <br/>
for far more boxes than I have found but am never discouraged.  I bring extra <br/>
baggies to refurbish the boxes that need some TLC and bring something to pick <br/>
up litter.<br/>
When driving or riding I look for places to place the boxes I am planning and <br/>
I make letterboxing what I want it to be for me. <br/>
So what motivates me? On any given day it could be the fact I prefer to <br/>
letterbox than do laundry, the need to learn something orjust because!!!!<br/>

So today I will grab my cane...walking stick... and place the HH I found over <br/>

I had a guy write me a while back after finding one of my boxes in the same town and he mentioned that he had learned of letterboxing when he stumbled across one of these boxes of the 20-series.

I've happened upon geocaches a number of times over the past few years, but have never come across a letterbox that I wasn't looking for, but I tend to know of the letterboxes in a park before going there, which makes them boxes I *am* looking for.<br/>

  20--wow, there's a fun way to spend the day. How did you find out they were there?<br/>
<br/>
  I've never been successful with "I don't have the clues but I know there's a box in this park somewhere"--although I found the most creative geocache I've ever seen that way (it was a hand-sized rubber frog stuck in a split in a tree). Heck, with some people's boxes (naming no nominal list owners' names) I can HAVE the clues &amp; know I'm within 30 paces of the box and still not find it, repeatedly.... 20 in one park would be good odds, though!<br/>

&gt;jumping to the defense of phyto and Mosey?<br/>
<br/>
I can't speak for anyone else but... on Sunday when this was being<br/>
posted I was at a conference on the Divine Feminie at Northwestern<br/>
University. And now I am at work and I am swamped. Not that I mean to<br/>
pull the "I have better things to do than be on the internet" card, but<br/>
really, on weekends lots of people are actually out there doing the<br/>
hobby, right?<br/>
<br/>
To my dismay there were NO boxes listed on LB.org or AQ in Evanston<br/>
[IL]! You would think with the university and the the college and the<br/>
temples and the vast numbers of gorgeous locations in that town, there<br/>
would be some. bummer. It's a total pain to drive the hour plus there<br/>
and find parking, and since I was going to do that anyway, thought it<br/>
would be great to combine it. <br/>
<br/>
However, I have learned thru this brou-ha-ha there might be some boxes<br/>
there, just not listed on those websites. There was one in Skokie, and<br/>
I dragged my best friend and helped her find it. It was fun. I<br/>
literally was so freakin' busy getting ready for this conference<br/>
[getting up at 6 am to go pick up numerous people, not getitng home<br/>
until after evening receptions only to fall in bed and do it all again<br/>
on little sleep] that this weekend I did not have time to sit and snark<br/>
on the internet. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think I did support Phyto though -- I just posted that they are his<br/>
boxes to do what he wishes. And I believe that. Just like it is his<br/>
business how he finds boxes. As long as he is sealing them up and<br/>
rehiding them as they were....<br/>
<br/>
I *think* Mosey lives in my area, IIRC. Someday I may actually try and<br/>
find those boxes. I am aware of the clues on Mosey's website. I never<br/>
thought you could google for clues though. If Mosey [not sure of he or<br/>
she pronoun here] prefers to post clues on a personal website, well, so<br/>
what. If Mosey prefers to write clues and put them in a bottle and drop<br/>
the bottle in the ocean and hope someone finds it... so what. it is<br/>
Mosey's time and effort. Not mine. It doesn't hurt me.<br/>
<br/>
The only disagreement I really had was the intimation that if you don't<br/>
place you are not giving anything to the community. I think<br/>
letterboxing is all about relationship, about giving and receiving.<br/>
Some people give, some receive. There is an element of mutuality. You<br/>
can't give without a receiver. If someone hides a box would they not<br/>
prefer that someone go looking and find it? Is that not why one goes to<br/>
the trouble? So if I take the time -- 5 minutes or 5 weeks -- to find<br/>
the box then I have engaged with the placer. If the placer does not<br/>
value that engagement, said placer will probably stop hiding boxes<br/>
eventually. I have only planted one box outside by the way -- and I did<br/>
so bc a nice lady in this town had hidden a good 10-12 boxes for me to<br/>
find, as well as finding everything in the local area. So I planted one<br/>
just to give her something new to do. And she went and found it. If<br/>
someone else finds it that will be nice too.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly I found the whole placing thing to be a giant PITA. And I<br/>
don't like carving stamps! But I might change. I've only been doing<br/>
this 3 months, give me a second here.<br/>
<br/>
I think the main rule is, don't flame people on the mailing list.<br/>
Though personally it's not my business if people do, I am not a<br/>
moderator here. It's not place to tell people to settle down. We<br/>
certainly have some very passionate people in letterboxing.<br/>

So if you are a receiver and I am a giver, it is entirely on my back as a<br/>
giver to fulfill your mission as a receiver?  That's kind of like saying<br/>
"let's share the sled - you can have it on the trips up the hill, and I'll<br/>
have it on the trips down the hill."<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you though that it IS about giving and receiving.  BUT - until<br/>
you've had the opportunity to both give AND receive, you really can't<br/>
understand the dynamics of the whole game.  You can have a real good idea,<br/>
but you don't get the whole picture.  By understanding the feelings and<br/>
efforts that go into being a placer, you become a better finder.  By being a<br/>
really good finder, you become more attuned to how to create boxes worth<br/>
finding.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think you are missing the point of mutuality.  While it is about a give and receive relationship, it is better defined as both parties giving and both thus receiving.  Saying that some are the givers and some are the receivers is like showing up to the office christmas party with gift in hand, to find that half of your co-workers had not brought gifts to exchange, rather they will be the gift receivers.  While the gift giving experience certainly needs recipients to be meaningful, and it can even be said that some people prefer the giving over the receiving, I think most people would agree that in order for it to be considered mutual, both parties give and both receive.<br/>
<br/>
In letterboxing there is no obligation to place or to find.  A person can choose to do one or the other or some self-defined combination of the two.  I would agree with other comments that have been made that a person should not plant a box just because they feel obligated to do so, rather planting a box should be because a person truly wants to do so, whether that be a desire to create something or to give something to other letterboxers -- the reasoning is not important.  Some people may never want to plant a box and that is fine, although I agree with Lucy that it is difficult to get a true big-picture perspective on the game without actively participating from both the finding and the planting.  So be it, it is still okay to not plant.<br/>
<br/>
However, I wouldn't consider it to be a fully mutual relationship in that case.  It is true that finders are a necessary part of the letterboxing equation, but they are still on the receiving end of the equation.  So while a person who only finds boxes is most certainly an integral and valued part of the letterboxing game, they are not necessarily giving anthing other than participation, which is a fundamental given from anyone who letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
You youself gave the example of the person in your area who had planted several boxes and you then planted one to give something back to her.  To follow your reasoning, there would have been no need to plant a box for her, rather it should have been giving enough that you looked for her boxes.<br/>

This is meant only to present my perspective, not to win you over or attempt to tell you how to think or to imply that you or anyone else are not "real" letterboxers if you do not share my perspective.  As with anything else, taking any part of the above out of context will no doubt provide you with material to support your own arguments and show just cause for flinging rutabagas in willy-nilly fashion at anyone you consider to be an elitist.<br/>

No where, that's where. If you want to give, you give. And others receive. How can you give <br/>
with no one to receive? You can't.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't want to give, then don't. But don't put some martyrdom on me, like oh you <br/>
have to give bc I am forcing you to do so.<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely. That is exactly what I meant. I had no obligation whatsoever, and there was no <br/>
need at all bc she got enough joy out of me finding and appreciating her boxes. That was <br/>
my gift to her. She did appreciate the box I planted, but just my appreciation of her <br/>
planting efforts was enough for her.<br/>
<br/>
For me, receiving is a gift. I have had many such occasions where I gave gifts and no one <br/>
gave "gifts" back [including at Christmas] -- but their presence was a gift. Their receiving <br/>
is a gift. Their appreciation is a gift to me. Perhaps I am being too metaphysical here. [I am <br/>
used to posting more on esoteric spiritual lists. The giving/receiving is a part of <br/>
Benedictine philosophy. It's connected to the charism of hospitality.]<br/>
<br/>
To follow that logic... if someone is a lurker on this list and never says a word... if they <br/>
read my posts and think about them, they receive, that is enough. A comment back is <br/>
awesome of course -- but it is not why I write.<br/>

Okay, I totally get it and appreciate that. I thought your post was also written in language <br/>
that made that clear, even without the disclaimer, but thank you for it anyway.<br/>
