To be specific, the box is at Castle Rock Park in Walnut Creek. The directions and clues are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
If you're coming from Walnut Creek take Ygnacio Valey Rd. Turn Right on Walnut Ave.  At the end, you'll make a Right on Oak Grove Rd.,which turns into Castle Rock Rd.  Follow the road all the way to the end, and park at the entrance gate.  (Parking is free.)  At the gate you start on the path that takes you through the park.  You will see picnic benches and what looks like a playground.  This park is used for many large party picnics and such.  Continue on the path, taking the Diablo Foothills Trail.  Keep following the main trail until you get to a "T".  Bear Left and keep going on the path until you get to the creek.  You'll want to cross the creek on the Left side, not straight ahead.  Take the path upwards and to the Right.  Keep going up until you get to "Cave Man Curry Cave".  This is an interesting place to rest, as you have quite a hike a bit ahead of you.  The path will continue on the Right of the cave.  Go up in between the two walls of rock, over the one in the middle.  Just after you get over the rock, you'll see a small clearing on your right.  It's just a little grassy knowle (sp?) that takes you to the edge of the cliff.  You can stand there on a boulder and enjoy the view of the hillside.  If you turn directly around, facing the main path again, to your right you'll see two small boulders.  On the right of the boulders, and slightly in between the two, you'll find my box.  Please hide it nicely when you're done.  Good luck, and please email me if you have any trouble finding the spot.  For those adventurous hikers, you can continue to take the trail up the mountain and there is a secret way to get to the caves you see directly above you.  This hike is moderately difficult and takes about 35 minutes.  <br/>
<br/>
The date the box was placed was yesterday, Tuesday the 15th, April, 2003.  This box is in Walnut Creek, CA, contra costa county. <br/>
