When we think of the brave heroes that won independence for our country we<br/>
often think of men and most of our patriots were in fact men but truth be<br/>
told some were women. Some of these female heroes gave aid to those in need<br/>
and others bared arms against the enemy. While researching the Revolutionary<br/>
War I tripped over information about the following handful of women. I hope<br/>
you find their stories as interesting as I did.<br/>

Revolutionary<br/>
&gt; War I tripped over information about the following handful of <br/>
women. I hope<br/>
&gt; you find their stories as interesting as I did.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the Hale Homestead parking area (don't miss boxes Uncle Sam's <br/>
Nephew,<br/>
&gt; Stars and Stripes &amp; Charter Oak) Turn LEFT out of the drive onto <br/>
the main<br/>
&gt; road, South Street. Across the street from the Strong Porter House <br/>
there is<br/>
&gt; room for one or two cars to park. You will see two stone memorials. <br/>
One<br/>
&gt; marks the site of Nathan's childhood friend Asher Wright's home. <br/>
Wright<br/>
&gt; later went on to become Nathan's Army attendant. The other stone is <br/>
in honor<br/>
&gt; of Harry MsKusick who was the Chief Forrester for the State of CT. <br/>
His widow<br/>
&gt; is a dear friend of mine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Between these two stones is the old cart path you must take. Follow <br/>
straight<br/>
&gt; until the stonewall on your right comes to a corner.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The oldest of twelve children, Sybil Ludington was a responsible<br/>
&gt; 16-year-old. On the night of April 16 1777, word reached her <br/>
family's home<br/>
&gt; that the British were burning Danbury, CT which was 25 miles away. <br/>
She<br/>
&gt; convinced her father who was a colonel in the local militia to let <br/>
her ride<br/>
&gt; and alert people. Through the dark night she rode forty miles on <br/>
horse back<br/>
&gt; with only a stick to prod her horse, Star. The men she warned <br/>
arrived just<br/>
&gt; in time to drive the British back to their ship in Long Island <br/>
Sound.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Turn right at the intersection and walk 28 paces (Left Foot) on the <br/>
mowed<br/>
&gt; path. Stop! Look off the trail to the left. You will see a pile of <br/>
rocks at<br/>
&gt; the base of a tree. Wedged between 2 stones at the back side of the <br/>
tree you<br/>
&gt; will find BOX 1. Please make sure you seal all the boxes well as I <br/>
am not<br/>
&gt; sure of durability of the seals. Thanks! Back to the path.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A school teacher Deborah Samson had only one question "Why can't I <br/>
fight for<br/>
&gt; my country, too?" In May of 1782 she signed up to join the 4th <br/>
Massachusetts<br/>
&gt; Regiment using the name Robert Shurtleff. During a battle in New <br/>
York she<br/>
&gt; was wounded in the head and thigh. She didn't tell the field Dr <br/>
that her leg<br/>
&gt; was hit for fear of discovery. She tried to treat herself and her <br/>
leg never<br/>
&gt; healed right. Weeks later she developed a fever and this time the Dr<br/>
&gt; discovered her secret and removed her from the field. She was <br/>
honorably<br/>
&gt; discharged October 1783. Paul Revere petitioned Mass. to repay her <br/>
for her<br/>
&gt; duty. In the early 1800s she received a pension of $4 a month.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Continue on the path. To the right you will see the stone wall. <br/>
Three large<br/>
&gt; pines stand at attention on the path. 2 on the right and 1 on the <br/>
left. 5<br/>
&gt; paces after the pine on the left a small tree lies across the path, <br/>
pointing<br/>
&gt; directly at a distictive looking tree. At the back base you will <br/>
find BOX 2.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Angelica Vrooman, during the heat of battle, sat calmly in a tent <br/>
with a<br/>
&gt; bullet mould, some lead and an iron spoon, molding bullets for the <br/>
rangers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Back to the path. Go 20 paces. Ahead you will see a tree with 2 <br/>
trunks.<br/>
&gt; Under the old dead wood laying near by, you find BOX 3.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nancy Morgan Hart, and her husband lived on the banks of <br/>
the "Wahatchee"<br/>
&gt; (means War Woman) Creek. The Indians gave it this name in honor of <br/>
Nancy.<br/>
&gt; She was able to keep the farm running and spied on the Tories. Once <br/>
she<br/>
&gt; gathered information by selling eggs to the Tories another time she<br/>
&gt; pretended to be a half wit and was able to over hear key <br/>
information that<br/>
&gt; would help the American cause. One day a group of Tories killed her <br/>
turkey<br/>
&gt; and demanded she cook for them. While she cooked she fed them <br/>
alcohol and<br/>
&gt; told them stories. They became so drunk that she was able to take <br/>
their<br/>
&gt; weapons and hold them at gun point until help came.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Continue down the path. Trail bends to the left. At the bend veer <br/>
off the<br/>
&gt; path to the right. Just before the break in the stone wall turn <br/>
left and<br/>
&gt; follow the wall to it's very end. At the very end under a flat <br/>
stone you<br/>
&gt; will find BOX 4.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Margaret "Molly" Corbin followed her husband from encampment to <br/>
encampment.<br/>
&gt; The soldiers taught her to use the canons and guns inexchange she <br/>
mended and<br/>
&gt; cooked for them. In the battle of Fort Washington in New York <br/>
against the<br/>
&gt; Hessians her husband who was firing a cannon fell to his death. <br/>
Molly<br/>
&gt; quickly jumped in, took charge and manned the cannon. She was hit, &amp;<br/>
&gt; wounded. She was the first American woman to be wounded on the <br/>
battlefield<br/>
&gt; fighting for American independence. In June of 1779 she was granted <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; pension. She was the first woman to be paid a pension by the United <br/>
States<br/>
&gt; government for service to her country.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Back to the trail. Turn left and head back the way you came. Walk <br/>
all the<br/>
&gt; way back to the intersection with the large oak to your left. If <br/>
you turn<br/>
&gt; left you will go back to your car. If you turn right you will find <br/>
treasure<br/>
&gt; 5. Turn Right. A few feet in you will notice the stonewall on your <br/>
left and<br/>
&gt; on the right a pile of dead wood. In the end of one of the large <br/>
logs you<br/>
&gt; will find BOX 5.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

  you seal all the boxes well as I <br/>am not<br/>&gt; sure of durability of the 
  seals. Thanks! Back to the path.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; A school teacher Deborah 
  Samson had only one question "Why can't I <br/>fight for<br/>&gt; my country, 
  too?" In May of 1782 she signed up to join the 4th <br/>Massachusetts<br/>&gt; 
  Regiment using the name Robert Shurtleff. During a battle in New <br/>York 
  she<br/>&gt; was wounded in the head and thigh. She didn't tell the field Dr 
  <br/>that her leg<br/>&gt; was hit for fear of discovery. She tried to treat 
  herself and her <br/>leg never<br/>&gt; healed right. Weeks later she developed 
  a fever and this time the Dr<br/>&gt; discovered her secret and removed her 
  from the field. She was <br/>honorably<br/>&gt; discharged October 1783. Paul 
  Revere petitioned Mass. to repay her <br/>for her<br/>&gt; duty. In the early 
  1800s she received a pension of $4 a month.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Continue on the 
  path. To the right you will see the stone wall. <br/>Three large<br/>&gt; pines 
  stand at attention on the path. 2 on the right and 1 on the <br/>left. 
  5<br/>&gt; paces after the pine on the left a small tree lies across the path, 
  <br/>pointing<br/>&gt; directly at a distictive looking tree. At the back base 
  you will <br/>find BOX 2.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Angelica Vrooman, during the heat of 
  battle, sat calmly in a tent <br/>with a<br/>&gt; bullet mould, some lead and an 
  iron spoon, molding bullets for the <br/>rangers.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Back to the 
  path. Go 20 paces. Ahead you will see a tree with 2 <br/>trunks.<br/>&gt; Under 
  the old dead wood laying near by, you find BOX 3.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Nancy 
  Morgan Hart, and her husband lived on the banks of <br/>the "Wahatchee"<br/>&gt; 
  (means War Woman) Creek. The Indians gave it this name in honor of 
  <br/>Nancy.<br/>&gt; She was able to keep the farm running and spied on the 
  Tories. Once <br/>she<br/>&gt; gathered information by selling eggs to the 
  Tories another time she<br/>&gt; pretended to be a half wit and was able to 
  over hear key <br/>information that<br/>&gt; would help the American cause. One 
  day a group of Tories killed her <br/>turkey<br/>&gt; and demanded she cook for 
  them. While she cooked she fed them <br/>alcohol and<br/>&gt; told them stories. 
  They became so drunk that she was able to take <br/>their<br/>&gt; weapons and 
  hold them at gun point until help came.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Continue down the 
  path. Trail bends to the left. At the bend veer <br/>off the<br/>&gt; path to 
  the right. Just before the break in the stone wall turn <br/>left and<br/>&gt; 
  follow the wall to it's very end. At the very end under a flat <br/>stone 
  you<br/>&gt; will find BOX 4.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Margaret "Molly" Corbin followed 
  her husband from encampment to <br/>encampment.<br/>&gt; The soldiers taught her 
  to use the canons and guns inexchange she <br/>mended and<br/>&gt; cooked for 
  them. In the battle of Fort Washington in New York <br/>against the<br/>&gt; 
  Hessians her husband who was firing a cannon fell to his death. 
  <br/>Molly<br/>&gt; quickly jumped in, took charge and manned the cannon. She 
  was hit, &amp;<br/>&gt; wounded. She was the first American woman to be wounded 
  on the <br/>battlefield<br/>&gt; fighting for American independence. In June of 
  1779 she was granted <br/>a<br/>&gt; pension. She was the first woman to be paid 
  a pension by the United <br/>States<br/>&gt; government for service to her 
  country.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Back to the trail. Turn left and head back the way 
  you came. Walk <br/>all the<br/>&gt; way back to the intersection with the large 
  oak to your left. If <br/>you turn<br/>&gt; left you will go back to your car. 
  If you turn right you will find <br/>treasure<br/>&gt; 5. Turn Right. A few feet 
  in you will notice the stonewall on your <br/>left and<br/>&gt; on the right a 
  pile of dead wood. In the end of one of the large <br/>logs you<br/>&gt; will 
  find BOX 5.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Let me know if you visit the series and how it
