good shape. It's had quite a few visitors lately. It wasn't in the <br/>
original spot I placed it in though. I fixed that! The clues <br/>
say: "Just behind the trunk of that bush you will find the prize <br/>
covered will dirt and leaves." That is where I prefer it stays. Not <br/>
in front of the bush. Thanks in advance.<br/>
