<br/>
West Michigan, Oceana County, near Hesperia, MI, placed by Arbo on <br/>
7/30/02 <br/>
A 1-hour hike located in the Manistee National Forest along the White <br/>
River in the Pines Point Recreation area.<br/>
Getting there: From US31, Take the M120 North exit. Continue North <br/>
for an approximate 20 miles. Turn left at the sign for Pines Point <br/>
Recreation Area (Garfield Rd.); Turn left onto 168th Ave. This <br/>
becomes the main park road. At the stop sign turn right into the <br/>
parking area.<br/>
<br/>
Notes<br/>
<br/>
To really enjoy the area bring a lunch to cook on the grills <br/>
provided. This area is perfect for cooling off on a hot summer day by <br/>
tubing the river around the point. This box is really best found by <br/>
paddling the White River. You can find information on paddling the <br/>
river in Hesperia. If you don't have a boat, canoes and kayaks can be <br/>
rented in town also. <br/>
<br/>
Clues<br/>
<br/>
Find the boardwalk and following that trail you will walk through a <br/>
picnic area. Continue on to the point where you can stand with the <br/>
river on both sides of you.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the path where the river flows to your right side. <br/>
<br/>
Look for a frog pond. From there look towards the east and spy a tall <br/>
crooked dead standing stump on high ground.<br/>

&gt; Find the boardwalk and following that trail you will walk through a <br/>

&gt; river on both sides of you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Follow the path where the river flows to your right side. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Look for a frog pond. From there look towards the east and spy a <br/>
tall <br/>
&gt; crooked dead standing stump on high ground.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From this dead tree go 45 degrees and 16 paces to another standing <br/>
&gt; dead tree filled with woodpecker holes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then continue on at 48 degrees and 26 paces while looking for a <br/>
very <br/>
&gt; large pine tree.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At 88 degrees and 9 paces you will find a multi-trunk tree.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then a short 9 paces and 50 degrees will reveal the tree that holds <br/>
&gt; your prize. It is hidden under leaves and a dead piece of wood in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; open area of the tree. Happy hunting!<br/>
