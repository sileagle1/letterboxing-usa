On the Tupperware trail<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
           GLOCESTER -- The empty parking lot must mean something. Danger<br/>
abounds. Stay away.<br/>
<br/>
     But Christopher Martin and Kim Calcagno approach.<br/>
<br/>
     Their car pulls into the Durfee Hill Management Area. They step out and<br/>
fearlessly face the forest.<br/>
<br/>
     It's quiet, the calm before the kill.<br/>
<br/>
     Yes, they're here to hunt. And judging by their attire and demeanor,<br/>
they've got more than mushrooms on their minds.<br/>
<br/>
     The 36-year-old Providence man holds a map -- not the kind with roads,<br/>
but clues, as though looking for buried treasure. Take 10 steps from the<br/>
stump; turn right at the rock; that sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
     And the 31-year-old Holbrook, Mass., woman is the keeper of the<br/>
compass.        <br/>
<br/>
     Into the woods they walk, without weapons, apparently prepared to<br/>
pounce       on their prey with bare hands, rip off its stay-fresh top and<br/>
pull out       its plastic innards.<br/>
<br/>
     They're here to hunt Tupperware.<br/>
<br/>
     That's right. It's out there, hiding and living in the wild, feeding<br/>
off       who knows what -- leftovers most likely.<br/>
<br/>
     Or perhaps it's not eating at all, but storing food for later.<br/>
<br/>
     So call in your pets and small children. We're going after it. We're<br/>
tracking its scent, assuming its seal has been broken.<br/>
<br/>
     If not, that's fine. Martin and Calcagno say they've got all they need<br/>
for their pacifist brand of hunting, which they call letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
     It's part hiking, part orienteering, part stamping and scavenger<br/>
hunting. Here's how it works: Letterboxers create their own signature<br/>
stamp and carry around notebooks. A person hides a notebook and a stamp<br/>
in a waterproof container -- most often Tupperware -- and others try to<br/>
find it by following clues found on the world's official and communal<br/>
letterboxing Web site:       www.letterboxing.org<br/>
<http: www.letterboxing.org=""></http:> , which lists 4,648 letterboxes in 50 states<br/>
and       eight countries.<br/>
<br/>
     When a letterbox is discovered, its finder stamps and signs the<br/>
notebook       inside and stamps his own notebook with the letterbox's<br/>
stamp.        <br/>
<br/>
     Wanda and Pete Miner of Charlestown are the reigning American<br/>
letterboxing champions, finding 2,780 so far. They got started as so<br/>
many letterboxers do, hiking. They're walking in the woods anyway. Why<br/>
not, they thought, add intrigue to their outings?<br/>
<br/>
     "At first, I was not impressed," Wanda Miner says. "Why would I want to<br/>
go and look for a box? Now here I am in love with the hobby."<br/>
<br/>
     The goal is to get out. See and appreciate nature. In return, receive a<br/>
reward.        <br/>
<br/>
     "It's like someone has given me a gift," Wanda Miner says. "They're<br/>
giving me a special stamp, or leading me to a special place."<br/>
<br/>
     Letterboxing started in 1854. An Englishman put his calling card in a<br/>
bottle, hid it outdoors and others found it. For more than a century the<br/>
activity operated in obscurity, especially in the United States. Then,<br/>
in 1998, Smithsonian Magazine published an article about it.<br/>
<br/>
     Letterboxing burgeoned. Jay Drew is partly to blame.<br/>
<br/>
     The former Newport man, now living in East Lyme, Conn., his wife<br/>
Margaret and their four children, have hidden more letterboxes than any<br/>
other Americans: more than 350.<br/>
<br/>
     "There's something sneaky and fun about it," Drew says. "You have a<br/>
gleam in your eye wondering if someone will find it."<br/>
<br/>
     In most instances finding a box isn't difficult. Follow the directions.<br/>
That's all it takes.<br/>
<br/>
     But in some cases, it's not so simple. With about 10 percent of<br/>
letterboxes, the clues are cryptic.<br/>
<br/>
     With some, you must solve riddles, break codes or, even, translate<br/>
Polish. That would be the appropriately named Polish Box in Pulaski<br/>
Memorial State Park in Burrillville.<br/>
<br/>
     "That was evil," Calcagno says.<br/>
<br/>
     Fortunately, Martin works with a man who knows Polish. Unfortunately,<br/>
the box still couldn't be found, even after three outings.<br/>
<br/>
     As it turns out, someone stole it, or, as letterboxers say, it went<br/>
missing.        <br/>
<br/>
     "That's why you want to be low-key about people seeing you," Martin<br/>
says. "You don't know what other people's disposition is."<br/>
<br/>
     Not everyone understands, appreciates and supports letterboxing. In<br/>
fact, some public park officials are opposed to it.<br/>
<br/>
     "They consider it littering," Martin says.<br/>
<br/>
     Environment not disturbed<br/>
<br/>
     Letterboxers, of course, disagree. You can't see the boxes; they're<br/>
hidden. But they're not buried because that would disturb the<br/>
environment.       <br/>
<br/>
     "It's very important we leave no trace on the environment," Calcagno<br/>
says. "We tell everyone about boxing, but don't want them to notice us<br/>
while we do it."   <br/>
<br/>
     That explains much. Calcagno is a naturalist at the Massachusetts<br/>
Audubon Society's Moose Hill Wildlife Sanctuary in Sharon. She didn't<br/>
know about letterboxing until Martin told her about it more than a year<br/>
ago. And she didn't know there were four letterboxes hidden where she<br/>
works.        <br/>
<br/>
     But in hindsight, Calcagno says, it figures.<br/>
<br/>
     "There are four distinct places in the sanctuary where people visit."<br/>
<br/>
     As Martin and Calcagno walk into the woods, they enter a world of<br/>
staggering beauty, with a budding leaf canopy, a symphony of birds,<br/>
frogs and wind, and a relentless waterfall crashing on rocks. They stay<br/>
on the trail. This minimizes their impact on the environment. And they<br/>
pick up litter along the way.<br/>
<br/>
     Eventually, clues pull them from the path. But roughing it, Martin and<br/>
Calcagno are not. There's a code among letterboxers. Don't endanger each<br/>
other or the environment.<br/>
<br/>
     But still, there are mishaps. There are letterboxes hidden in the dead<br/>
of winter, that spring reveals in patches of pricker bushes and poison<br/>
ivy.        <br/>
<br/>
     "I know what poison ivy looks like," Martin says. "I just don't notice<br/>
it when I'm walking."<br/>
<br/>
     Waist deep in mud<br/>
<br/>
     There was a Virginia letterboxer known only as Psycho Mommy who one<br/>
spring, after the winter thaw, walked into waist-deep mud and had to be<br/>
pulled out by firefighters.<br/>
<br/>
     This is simpler. Martin and Calcagno walk along a brook, come to a<br/>
waterfall and turn toward a stone wall, the preferred letterbox hiding<br/>
place.        <br/>
<br/>
     "In New England it's easy because we have so many stone walls,"<br/>
Calcagno       says. "Other places you go, you find a suspicious collection<br/>
of stones."        <br/>
<br/>
     There's the letterbox, between the rocks, a hibernating full-grown<br/>
Tupperware container.<br/>
<br/>
     They open it. A note inside says "this is not trash." It's meant for<br/>
non-letterboxers. Martin and Calcagno stamp the notebook inside the<br/>
letterbox, read the messages left by others and add some of their own.<br/>
<br/>
     And off they go to look for other letterboxes, two in particular, one<br/>
called Laurel and the other Hardy. On their way, they come upon another<br/>
couple, a woman looking up into the trees and a man looking down at a<br/>
piece of paper.    <br/>
<br/>
     It's Wanda and Pete Miner.<br/>
<br/>
     "If you see people in the woods and they have a piece of paper and they<br/>
appear to be lost," Martin says. "They're probably letterboxers."            <br/>

No, I don't think it's an issue in this case -- it's only a one-line <br/>
mention.  Reprinting someone's complete story in a book or on a <br/>
website is a different thing.  Psychomommy's story is available in <br/>
the archives, as is Chuck's story of falling down the cliff.  If I <br/>
was looking to use their own words, I would ask permission first.<br/>

Psychomommy is from MD, it happened in MD and it happened in the <br/>
fall, during the horrible drought. Post # 18693.<br/>
   I suppose that is called Hollywood licensing. SO - Maybe the story <br/>
should now end with me falling in love with my handsome firefighter <br/>
and living happily ever after. And, of course, a fabulous, voluptuous <br/>
picture of me being rescued!<br/>
   Yeah, that would be cool!!!<br/>
   Thanks for the mention,<br/>

&gt; ago. And she didn't know there were four letterboxes hidden where <br/>
she<br/>
&gt; works.        <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      But in hindsight, Calcagno says, it figures.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      "There are four distinct places in the sanctuary where people <br/>
visit."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      As Martin and Calcagno walk into the woods, they enter a world <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; staggering beauty, with a budding leaf canopy, a symphony of birds,<br/>
&gt; frogs and wind, and a relentless waterfall crashing on rocks. They <br/>
stay<br/>
&gt; on the trail. This minimizes their impact on the environment. And <br/>
they<br/>
&gt; pick up litter along the way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      Eventually, clues pull them from the path. But roughing it, <br/>
Martin and<br/>
&gt; Calcagno are not. There's a code among letterboxers. Don't endanger <br/>
each<br/>
&gt; other or the environment.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      But still, there are mishaps. There are letterboxes hidden in <br/>
the dead<br/>
&gt; of winter, that spring reveals in patches of pricker bushes and <br/>
poison<br/>
&gt; ivy.        <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      "I know what poison ivy looks like," Martin says. "I just <br/>
don't notice<br/>
&gt; it when I'm walking."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      Waist deep in mud<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      There was a Virginia letterboxer known only as Psycho Mommy <br/>
who one<br/>
&gt; spring, after the winter thaw, walked into waist-deep mud and had <br/>
to be<br/>
&gt; pulled out by firefighters.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      This is simpler. Martin and Calcagno walk along a brook, come <br/>
to a<br/>
&gt; waterfall and turn toward a stone wall, the preferred letterbox <br/>
hiding<br/>
&gt; place.        <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      "In New England it's easy because we have so many stone walls,"<br/>
&gt; Calcagno       says. "Other places you go, you find a suspicious <br/>
collection<br/>
&gt; of stones."        <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      There's the letterbox, between the rocks, a hibernating full-<br/>
grown<br/>
&gt; Tupperware container.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      They open it. A note inside says "this is not trash." It's <br/>
meant for<br/>
&gt; non-letterboxers. Martin and Calcagno stamp the notebook inside the<br/>
&gt; letterbox, read the messages left by others and add some of their <br/>
own.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      And off they go to look for other letterboxes, two in <br/>
particular, one<br/>
&gt; called Laurel and the other Hardy. On their way, they come upon <br/>
another<br/>
&gt; couple, a woman looking up into the trees and a man looking down at <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; piece of paper.    <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      It's Wanda and Pete Miner.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      "If you see people in the woods and they have a piece of paper <br/>
and they<br/>
&gt; appear to be lost," Martin says. "They're probably <br/>
letterboxers."            <br/>

Nah, it's just our shoddy memories in relating the story!  Your post <br/>
is far more interesting than the one-line summary the reporter wrote.<br/>
