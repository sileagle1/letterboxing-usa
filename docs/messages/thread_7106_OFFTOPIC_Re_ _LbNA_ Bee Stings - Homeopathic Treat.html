but does not flower like it.  Chew a very small amount of it, and place <br/>
as a poltrice on the sting.  It's an old herbal remedy, and is very <br/>
convenient to have in the field...<br/>

&gt; Hello Everyone!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Recently, my hometown, Syracuse NY ABC-TV affiliate WIXT, aired a health <br/>
segment on treating bee stings after a local doctor succumbed to one. I <br/>
recently got stung and have had a mild, yet prolonged allergic reaction <br/>
for two weeks.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I contacted WIXT who kindly sent me the transcript of the segment <br/>
&gt; where a homeopathic product was mentioned that works for some <br/>
&gt; people. I like that this product is not heat sensitive like epi-pens.  <br/>
&gt; Below is that transcript.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; "...A PHARMACIST TOLD HER ABOUT THIS, A HOMEOPATHIC REMEDY CALLED <br/>
&gt; APIS, SHE WENT TO THE HEALTH FOOD STORE<br/>
&gt; AND BOUGHT SOME.  UNLIKE THE EPI PENS WHICH ARE HEAT SENSITIVE, APIS <br/>
&gt; CAN BE CARRIED IN THE CAR, AND AS YOU SAW, IT'S ALSO SMALL ENOUGH TO <br/>
&gt; KEEP IN YOUR PURSE.  IT'S ALSO QUITE INEXPENSIVE...WE CHECKED WITH A <br/>
&gt; HEALTH FOOD STORE AND THEY SELL IT FOR FOUR DOLLARS FOR 75 TABLETS.  <br/>
&gt; BUT THEY SAY  IT DOESN'T WORK FOR<br/>
&gt; EVERYONE, SO YOU NEED TO HAVE A BACKUP PLAN."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope this helps all of us. If anyone has used this either of these <br/>
&gt; products after a bee sting, I would like to know what your experiences <br/>
&gt; have been like. Thanks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
