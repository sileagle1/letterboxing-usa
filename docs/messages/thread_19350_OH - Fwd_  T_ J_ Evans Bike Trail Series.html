REGARDING:  LETTERBOXING NORTH AMERICA<br/>
<br/>
To Whom It May Concern:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We were made aware recently of the fact that your organization has <br/>
placed<br/>
"letterboxing" information along the T. J. Evans Bike Trail.  While we<br/>
appreciate your use of our facilities, we are requesting that you <br/>
remove all<br/>
letterboxing from each location along the trail.<br/>
<br/>
The Licking Park District maintains the bike trail for the T. J. Evans<br/>
Foundation and it is against Park District Rules and Regulations to <br/>
allow<br/>
such activities to operate in and on any of our facilities.  Please <br/>
be aware<br/>
that property owners along the trail would not appreciate anyone <br/>
walking or<br/>
searching on their property.<br/>
<br/>
Your organization may be faced with violating our rules and <br/>
regulations and<br/>
be guilty of a minor misdemeanor per the Ohio Revised Code.  There <br/>
are rules<br/>
in place regarding defacement, littering, safety, leaving personal<br/>
possessions, encroachment and organizational violations.<br/>
You failed to notify us of your actions and we need to discuss these <br/>
issues<br/>
with you.<br/>
<br/>
Please contact me as soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gay Anderson<br/>
Office Manager<br/>
