                    <div class="plaintext-content">That was one of my gifts too!  We drove down to Charlestown RI for <br/>
the day. First we did the Trustom Pond Quest. We spent 2 hours there -<br/>
 so much beauty to absorb! I saw my first bluebird ever, a redwing <br/>
black bird, a heron and lots of swans. We had a funny encounter with <br/>
a pair of swans that had commandeered a section of the path. One <br/>
acted like a military escort, accompanying us to and from the <br/>
observation deck, making sure we didn't get near a nest perhaps?<br/>
<br/>
After lunch we went on to Burlingame State park and did some of the <br/>
My Favorite Ornaments series. We found The Mushroom, the Broken <br/>
Heart, the Cuckoo Clock and the elusive "Pickle". The Support our <br/>
Troops Hitchhiker was visiting the Cuckoo Clock. We took it home to <br/>
Massachusetts and will find it a new host box very soon.<br/>
Great Day!<br/>
