                    <div class="plaintext-content">The `We Live and Breathe Letterboxing' event is not set up as a <br/>
typical gathering!  It is not a potluck at a park or a campout in a <br/>
campground.  This is completely different  more of a summer <br/>
overnight camp for letterboxers, or a letterboxing retreat.<br/>
<br/>
It will be impossible to `just drop in' or pay at the door, even for <br/>
the locals.  Every attendee MUST be registered before the deadline to <br/>
satisfy our contractual agreement with Camp Adams, our insurance <br/>
policies, and the kitchen counts for meals.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, there are a couple of people who are no longer able to attend <br/>
and may be interested in selling their registration.  If you want <br/>
more info, let me know.<br/>
<br/>
The absolute DEADLINE TO REGISTER IS WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 3rd  <br/>
midnight PST, as either a DayTripper or for the full weekend.  The <br/>
registration form is located at our website at <br/>
WeLiveandBreathe.com.   You are not considered registered until we <br/>
have received both your form and payment.  If you have any questions, <br/>
please feel free to contact me.<br/>
<br/>
Don't delay, sign up today!<br/>
