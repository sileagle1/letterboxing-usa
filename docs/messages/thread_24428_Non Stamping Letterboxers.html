So, in not having a stamp, they just sign in, use their thumbprint or even stamp the boxes stamp into the logbook!

simple move to the back side of the same really cool rock.  That easy move<br/>

they signed in anyway -- sometimes because they couldn't find the <br/>
cache they were looking for.  Another time I was doing some boxes in a <br/>
certain area and noticed a person simply signed in, and then when I <br/>
went home to do some boxing, this person had signed in with a stamp -- <br/>
I have a feeling that someone they found out about those boxes in the <br/>
one area and went out looking, got bit by the "bug" when he found <br/>
them, then came home and found a stamp.  I also came across a box once <br/>
where the person was on vacation and forgot to bring their stamp with <br/>
them, so they simply signed in to let the host know they were dropping <br/>
off a hitchhiker.  There could be a lot of reasons.  Laziness could <br/>
also be a reason, but I choose to give people the benefit of the <br/>
doubt....<br/>

&gt; Baker, my gut feeling is that you have a box (or boxes) that muggles are<br/>
&gt; finding.  Those seem to always be the ones without stamps of course.<br/>
<br/>
It's nice that they sign the log and replace rather than write <br/>
obscenities or steal the box.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of other possibilities here.  One is that the box <br/>
is hidden somewhere where it's difficult to stamp in without being <br/>
seen.  Some may opt to just sign and replace rather than breaking out <br/>
the stamp and ink pad, which might attract more attention.<br/>
<br/>
The proper thing to do in such cases -- in fact, in most cases -- is <br/>
to carry the box off a ways and take your time stamping in.  In <br/>
general, you never want to stamp in right at the hidey hole, because <br/>
a muggle might come by and see what you're doing and where you are.  <br/>
If he sees what you're doing at a picnic table 100 yards away, no <br/>
problem, in fact you can TELL him what you're doing -- you're not <br/>
giving away the hiding place.  And, of course, if you try to stamp in <br/>
at the hiding place and then see that a muggle is approaching, it's <br/>
too late to move off.  In general, always move away as soon as you <br/>
find the box before opening it up and stamping in.<br/>
<br/>
But many newbies may not know that, and decide that the most stealthy <br/>
thing to do is just sign and replace and get outta there.<br/>

&gt; Maybe it is letterboxers or geocachers not bothering with stamps. I <br/>
&gt; have noticed in geocaching that many people are just signing the log <br/>
&gt; book and are not exchanging trinkets...their custom similar to our <br/>
&gt; stamp exchange.<br/>
<br/>
That's probably most of them, actually.  A lot of geocachers are <br/>
adults, and most consider the trinket trading as just for the kids <br/>
who find the cache.<br/>
<br/>
In some cases, when I find a cache that contains nothing I'm <br/>
interested in, I'll take something anyway and leave something in <br/>
exchange just to move the toys around.  This is especially <br/>
appropriate in some cases where the geocache contains a zillion of <br/>
the exact same toy.  Some placers stock their new geocaches that way, <br/>
a whole box full of the same thing, you're supposed to trade stuff so <br/>
the toys move around.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of geocachers drop off a signature item, often a business card <br/>
or a wooden nickel or some such.  I personally find the practice <br/>
irritating; the signature item is rarely desirable as a trade item, <br/>
it just clutters up the cache.  Even when it is desirable, you're <br/>
left wondering if you're supposed to take a signature item or you're <br/>
expected to leave it in the cache.<br/>
<br/>
Some also have address labels printed up and stick them in the log <br/>
book.  Unfortunately, the things tend to peel off and then start <br/>
sticking pages together.<br/>
<br/>
I stamp geocache log books with my sig stamp.  It takes more time <br/>
than just signing, but it adds a bit of pizzazz to the log book <br/>
without taking up too much space or making a mess of things.<br/>

<br/>
I've been a member of the group for a few weeks and have been lurking every since.<br/>
<br/>
I placed a box back in March and in May got a message from a boxer that it had been opened and thrown about. When I looked to check in on the box I noticed the boxers whom logged in right before the box was reported damaged by the other boxer, all had no stamp just signed in. I had not seen their signatures before so I wondered if maybe they were new to boxing and didn't know to re-hide the box, but the signatures were very child like and maybe the chaperone didn't notice the kids didn't re-hide the box, either way I have seen the trend with other boxes were it seems they are not re-hidden well. MY friends and I just found a series last week were the first box appeared to be thrown into the bushes as apposed to being hidden under the rock were it obviously was before. I don't know if it's muggles finding the boxes or new comers not taking the time to re-hide the boxes. If it's new comers hopefully some might see this thread and start re-hiding the boxes; if it's muggles then hopefu<br/>
lly if they get into letterboxing they will know better for the next box they find. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Baker, my gut feeling is that you have a box (or boxes) that <br/>
&gt; muggles are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; finding.  Those seem to always be the ones without stamps of <br/>
&gt; course.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It's nice that they sign the log and replace rather than write <br/>
&gt; &gt; obscenities or steal the box.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; There are a couple of other possibilities here.  One is that the <br/>
&gt; box <br/>
&gt; &gt; is hidden somewhere where it's difficult to stamp in without being <br/>
&gt; &gt; seen.  Some may opt to just sign and replace rather than breaking <br/>
&gt; out <br/>
&gt; &gt; the stamp and ink pad, which might attract more attention.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The proper thing to do in such cases -- in fact, in most cases -- <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; to carry the box off a ways and take your time stamping in.  In <br/>
&gt; &gt; general, you never want to stamp in right at the hidey hole, <br/>
&gt; because <br/>
&gt; &gt; a muggle might come by and see what you're doing and where you <br/>
&gt; are.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; If he sees what you're doing at a picnic table 100 yards away, no <br/>
&gt; &gt; problem, in fact you can TELL him what you're doing -- you're not <br/>
&gt; &gt; giving away the hiding place.  And, of course, if you try to stamp <br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; at the hiding place and then see that a muggle is approaching, it's <br/>
&gt; &gt; too late to move off.  In general, always move away as soon as you <br/>
&gt; &gt; find the box before opening it up and stamping in.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; But many newbies may not know that, and decide that the most <br/>
&gt; stealthy <br/>
&gt; &gt; thing to do is just sign and replace and get outta there.<br/>

Well, I typically research something quite a bit before I take the <br/>
plunge, so I (and all other members of my family) had sig stamps when <br/>
we found our first letterboxes, and they were store bought.  In fact, <br/>
I have changed my store bought stamp since then, but do have plans of <br/>
carving one for myself as soon as I settle on something <br/>
distinctly "me" ;)<br/>

I started out with a simple store bought stamp as my sig, and have <br/>
since changed to two store bought stamps as my sig -- but I am working <br/>
very hard on designing a personal stamp (*think, think, think* tapping <br/>
head) that I will carve myself.  My family's stamps are all store <br/>
bought and probably will always be because they just aren't as into it <br/>
as I am -- they go along to humor me and to use as blackmail to get me <br/>
to do things they want to do....<br/>

I started out with a simple store bought stamp as my sig, and have <br/>
since changed to two store bought stamps as my sig -- but I am working <br/>
very hard on designing a personal stamp (*think, think, think* tapping <br/>
head) that I will carve myself. My family's stamps are all store <br/>
bought and probably will always be because they just aren't as into it <br/>
as I am -- they go along to humor me and to use as blackmail to get me <br/>
to do things they want to do....<br/>

I was bitten by the bug though, and by the time we went out again at the end of the week I'd carved my own stamp.  Still using the same one, although I recently changed my ink (couldn't find the original color in pigment)....<br/>

I did. It was the first stamp I'd carved, and I still use it for  sentimental <br/>
reasons. My first box was Houston Astros in Orange City, FL.  :o)<br/>

I haven't yet, but when I do, the original will most likely become a  <br/>
personal traveler. I just have to first figure out what image would mean enough  to <br/>
me to make the switch from the original.<br/>

I had a store-bought stamp for my first find (the letter Z)and had handcarved my first crude stamp for my mom ( now my personal traveler).  But quickly carved a rather crude padlock for myself.  WIthin a month or two I had carved the more elaborate stamp you see for me now.  I recently had my boxing stuff stolen, so I recarved my stamp with just a different background.<br/>

I also carved a sig stamp for Thot of Houston.  I'm not sure how <br/>
active he is; I carved a stamp for him to place, too, and the box <br/>
quickly went missing -- twice.  After I carved it the third time it's <br/>
apparently been more durable, but I think he was pretty disgusted <br/>

&gt; &gt; stamp exchange.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That's probably most of them, actually.  A lot of geocachers are <br/>
&gt; adults, and most consider the trinket trading as just for the kids <br/>
&gt; who find the cache.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In some cases, when I find a cache that contains nothing I'm <br/>
&gt; interested in, I'll take something anyway and leave something in <br/>
&gt; exchange just to move the toys around.  This is especially <br/>
&gt; appropriate in some cases where the geocache contains a zillion of <br/>
&gt; the exact same toy.  Some placers stock their new geocaches that <br/>
way, <br/>
&gt; a whole box full of the same thing, you're supposed to trade stuff <br/>
so <br/>
&gt; the toys move around.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A lot of geocachers drop off a signature item, often a business <br/>
card <br/>
&gt; or a wooden nickel or some such.  I personally find the practice <br/>
&gt; irritating; the signature item is rarely desirable as a trade item, <br/>
&gt; it just clutters up the cache.  Even when it is desirable, you're <br/>
&gt; left wondering if you're supposed to take a signature item or <br/>
you're <br/>
&gt; expected to leave it in the cache.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some also have address labels printed up and stick them in the log <br/>
&gt; book.  Unfortunately, the things tend to peel off and then start <br/>
&gt; sticking pages together.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I stamp geocache log books with my sig stamp.  It takes more time <br/>
&gt; than just signing, but it adds a bit of pizzazz to the log book <br/>
&gt; without taking up too much space or making a mess of things.<br/>

in. I had not seen their signatures before so I wondered if maybe <br/>
they were new to boxing and didn't know to re-hide the box, but the <br/>
signatures were very child like and maybe the chaperone didn't notice <br/>
the kids didn't re-hide the box, either way I have seen the trend <br/>
with other boxes were it seems they are not re-hidden well. MY <br/>
friends and I just found a series last week were the first box <br/>
appeared to be thrown into the bushes as apposed to being hidden <br/>
under the rock were it obviously was before. I don't know if it's <br/>
muggles finding the boxes or new comers not taking the time to re-<br/>
hide the boxes. If it's new comers hopefully some might see this <br/>
thread and start re-hiding the boxes; if it's muggles then hopefu<br/>
&gt; lly if they get into letterboxing they will know better for the <br/>
next box they find. <br/>

&gt; &gt; You may be right about that. I just hope that it is not a trend <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; &gt; newbies to get away from stamping.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baker, my gut feeling is that you have a box (or boxes) that <br/>
&gt; &gt; muggles are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; finding.  Those seem to always be the ones without stamps of <br/>
&gt; &gt; course.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's nice that they sign the log and replace rather than write <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; obscenities or steal the box.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; There are a couple of other possibilities here.  One is that <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; box <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is hidden somewhere where it's difficult to stamp in without <br/>
being <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; seen.  Some may opt to just sign and replace rather than <br/>
breaking <br/>
&gt; &gt; out <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the stamp and ink pad, which might attract more attention.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The proper thing to do in such cases -- in fact, in most cases -<br/>
- <br/>
&gt; &gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to carry the box off a ways and take your time stamping in.  In <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; general, you never want to stamp in right at the hidey hole, <br/>
&gt; &gt; because <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a muggle might come by and see what you're doing and where you <br/>
&gt; &gt; are.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If he sees what you're doing at a picnic table 100 yards away, <br/>
no <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem, in fact you can TELL him what you're doing -- you're <br/>
not <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; giving away the hiding place.  And, of course, if you try to <br/>
stamp <br/>
&gt; &gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; at the hiding place and then see that a muggle is approaching, <br/>
it's <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; too late to move off.  In general, always move away as soon as <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; find the box before opening it up and stamping in.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But many newbies may not know that, and decide that the most <br/>
&gt; &gt; stealthy <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing to do is just sign and replace and get outta there.<br/>

 I confess . . . I was sig-stampless on my first excursion. But I was <br/>
 instantly inspired that afternoon to run to an art supply store to get a <br/>
 carving block.<br/>
<br/>
 Here's a spin-off question . . .<br/>
 How many have updated/enhanced or completely changed there sig-stamp from <br/>
 their original carving?<br/>

 I'm thinking that there may just be a large contingent of newbies in<br/>
 the area, and they're all trying out some finds before they decide<br/>
 whether they're going to be interested enough to obtain a sig stamp.<br/>
 Somebody may even have suggested it somewhere, like on that infamous<br/>
 Chevy Suburban ad or something. Or maybe some primer described<br/>
 letterboxing and happened to omit mentioning the need for a sig<br/>
 stamp, and all these guys didn't have any idea a sig stamp was called<br/>
 for until they found their first box!<br/>

Embossing I guess. Years ago I made the mistake of buying an ink pad <br/>
for embossing, and when I got home and tried it out I knew immediately <br/>
that something was wrong. It's thick, gooey, and takes forever to dry. <br/>
I find it astounding that after stamping into the first box, anyone <br/>
would continue. I think it was particularily bad because after the <br/>
letterbox was closed there was no chance of it drying. I even had the <br/>
stuff on my clothes when I got home. But, it was a letterbox adventure, <br/>
and I have blue stains on my T-shirt to remember it by. :) <br/>

Embossing ink is a thick heavy ink that stays wet for a while.  You <br/>
stamp your image, then pour embossing powder over the ink, tap off <br/>
the excess powder and then use a heat gun to "set" the powder.  It'll <br/>
melt and harden, leaving the image raised (embossed) on the <br/>
paper.  Very cool and simple way to enhance your images on cards, <br/>
scrapbooks, etc.  Very bad idea for on-the-go letterboxing.<br/>

In my experience, most pigment inks aren't great for letterboxing, as <br/>
they usually take a long time to dry/set.  So, they stay wet on the <br/>
stamps and log books.  I'm sure there are exceptions, but in general, <br/>
pigment inks should probably be avoided for boxing unless you're <br/>
familiar with how they dry.<br/>

I can't say I've ever seen an ink pad that _wasn't_ acid free.  The <br/>
cheapest ink pads on the market, the StampCraft things sold at Wal-<br/>
Mart, are prominently labelled "acid free" and "archival safe".<br/>
<br/>
The one pigment ink pad I've purchased that didn't work well at all <br/>
just happened to be a Color Box.  I wonder if there's a lot of <br/>
variation from one pad to another, or maybe from one color to <br/>
another.<br/>

<br/>
Ah!  A heat gun!  Does the heat melt the powder itself?  And does the <br/>
heat also tend to dry the embossing ink, so that once done it's <br/>
pretty firmed up?<br/>
<br/>
I haven't noticed the heat guns.  Are they for sale on the same rack <br/>
somewhere?  Or do you just use a hair dryer?<br/>
<br/>
And do you generally apply such ink with a rubber stamp?  Or is this <br/>
some other unrelated idea?  If a rubber stamp is used, am I correct <br/>
in presuming it would need cleaning?<br/>

Offhand, I'm thinking it might be a very cool idea for a letterbox <br/>
log book cover.<br/>

<br/>
Y'know, the second pigment ink pad I purchased fits your description <br/>
perfectly, and as a result I don't use it.  The first one I bought <br/>
works great, though, I've never had a problem with it, the ink is <br/>
always dry by the time I'm through writing the date and whatever <br/>
comments I'm adding.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, everyone should have one black pigment ink pad in black simply <br/>
because black is used so often and the black dye ink pads are such a <br/>
lousy version of black, just a medium gray really.  My cheap pigment <br/>
ink pad makes things stamped in black look a lot better than that, <br/>
and Geometry Junkie's "graphite black" ink pad made mine look poor, <br/>
it is a true jet black when stamped.<br/>
<br/>
I actually have one black dye ink pad that makes a really black <br/>
image, from JoAnn Fabrics CraftEssentials line.  The problem is, if <br/>
you come back a week later, the image has grown a yellow border all <br/>
around it.  This is a really cool effect, it's especially nifty for <br/>
Halloween images, but it's not good for generic black images.<br/>

Funny you should say that. I was thinking the same thing. The color box  pads <br/>
that I have are the only ones I dislike. I find that their coverage of  the <br/>
stamp media is uneven, and the image is not very good-looking. I've had  great <br/>
success with All Night Media and Color Box pigment pads. Both of which dry  <br/>
quickly enough to use on the trail - even in our Florida humidity - and produce  <br/>
clear images.<br/>

LBing was my reason for hiking rather than stumbling across a box while hiking.  I'm the sort that prefers to get exercise as a by-product of something enjoyable. It alway amazes me how I can print off a few sheets of paper for several smaller hikes to make in a day, and spend 12 hours hunting boxes down, but used to find it impossible to find1/2 day to hike (The Adirondacks are a day trip around here).  If that isn't the epitome of weird, I don't know how to top it!<br/>
<br/>
And to answer the question at hand - yes, both 'ses' and I stopped at a craft store for commercial stamps (I used two together, so I suppose it was custom, but not hand-crafted) on our way to our first day's adventures!  (both of us having shed ex's similar to yours)<br/>

  Here, here!  I found out about boxing by coming across <br/>
the "Letterboxer's Companion" book at a library booksale.  I read it <br/>
cover to cover, ran to Michael's to find some pink stuff, attempted to <br/>
carve a stick figure and some lettering, then went out and found my <br/>
first boxes by myself as the sun went down.  Night boxing for a first <br/>
attempt! :)  Still using the same sig stamp a couple years <br/>
later...every time I think of recarving it (my skills improved a bit <br/>
with time), someone tells me how simple and happy it looks! hehe Guess <br/>
I'll keep it for awhile longer...<br/>
