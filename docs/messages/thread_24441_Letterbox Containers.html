Basically they are bowls with twist on lids made for liquid storage.  I will test them out in the kitchen before field testing them (LOL).  They didn't have a gasket but seemed, for the price, worth trying. Might be ok for some of the higher than ground level or urban plantings.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">While I did find Lock and Lock at my local Wal-Mart and clones at Job<br/>
Lot, the very best deal I found, provided they work as well, (I have a<br/>
couple but have yet to use them) are the L &amp; L knockoffs that I found<br/>
at a Dollar Tree store here in CT. They come in three or four sizes, and<br/>
all sizes are a dollar each. I found your Colonel Williams box and<br/>
loved it. If I'm correct in assuming that you live in that general<br/>
area, you can find Dollar Tree stores in Hudson Falls (a new one next<br/>
to the new Hannaford on Burgoyne Ave.) and in South Glens Falls in the<br/>
Midtown Shopping Center on Main Street. You might want to pay them a<br/>
visit. I can't remember if I saw them at the one in Hudson Falls when<br/>
I was there, but I can't imagine that one store in the chain would<br/>
carry them and another wouldn't.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also intrigued by, but have yet to find one up here, the amber<br/>
jars offered as LB containers at www.Dixiegrafix.com Click on the LB<br/>
link, and then on misc. They're four inches in diameter, and the size<br/>
might not be right for some bigger stamps. I'll probably order a<br/>
couple at some point. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, for the tip. I work near a recently opened OSJL.  I'll check it out at lunch tomorrow!  Funny how this obsession changes our shopping habits and the way we 'hunt' supplies!  I will also check out the Dollar Tree stores as Chris suggests.  One way I try to test boxes is to not only do the underwater test, but also to put it in the freezer for a week or so.  Being in Upstate NY, the winters can be tough on boxes.  Want to make sure that they can open easily and sustain jostling around rocks without breaking while in very cold temps. I'd rather spend a couple of bucks more than to spend $2 every year! Doing the research before starting the planting phase of LBing.<br/>
