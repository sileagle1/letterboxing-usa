<br/>
We tried the Tuckerman's Ravine II, with no luck.  There was a hole where the box should have been.  It is possible that a boxer was nearby with the box somewhere, logging in discreetly. There's no way to know.  We had to leave to get to the top of the mountain.  Tuckerman's Ravine by Bob and Judy was there, intact.  We were the second boxers to find it.  A skier had found it once by accident.<br/>
<br/>
We also sought and found all 3 of the Cathedral Ledge series, and The Old Man.  There were other boxes nearby but we'll have to go look for them.  Maybe another trip to NH is in order.  :-)   (But just Dan and myself, because our traveling partners don't care much for 'boxing.)<br/>
<br/>
These boxes had no notices requesting that their status not be shared. <br/>
