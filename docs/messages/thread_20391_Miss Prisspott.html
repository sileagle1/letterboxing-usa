Her Ladyship is quite at a loss to understand how use of the word<br/>
mensch (we'll discuss spelling of that word later) could offend. The<br/>
word derived from German and refers to mankind in the most general<br/>
sense and can refer to a specific man or even woman based on<br/>
contextual cues. You will have to explain your misunderstanding of the<br/>
meaning of this word to her Ladyship however for her to grasp your<br/>
offense.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In regard to spelling; Yiddish is a spoken language derived from many<br/>
Germanic dialects and is often spelled phonetically. There is a<br/>
project, which is attempting to establish uniform spelling for Yiddish<br/>
words however this is a recent project (late 20th century). The<br/>
spelling I used is quite correct however to be excruciatingly correct<br/>
it probably should have been spelled like its etymological source<br/>
which is "mensch". If you accept this posit then you too have<br/>
mispelled the word.<br/>

My interpretation of this word not only stems from its direct <br/>
translation of the German word (person) to the more colloquial and <br/>
perhaps more common use of the word (*!%$#$^&amp;)--this is the exact <br/>
phrase I use after that schmo cuts me off in traffic in Seattle (as <br/>
we're navigating the myriad roads in the area looking for those all <br/>
too obtuse letterboxes in these parts)! Of course, I only learned <br/>
this term from my exemplary driver's ed instructor as I earned my <br/>
Fuehrerschein in Germany way back when.  It comes in handier these <br/>
days as I'm able to 'respond' to the schmo without my kids really <br/>
knowing what I said!<br/>
