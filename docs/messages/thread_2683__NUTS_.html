&gt; Location: Metropolitan Park, Cleveland, Ohio<br/>
&gt; 	Urban parkland<br/>
&gt; Difficulty: easy to moderate<br/>
&gt; Time: short walk<br/>
&gt; P = footfall<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	The luminous vision of an aged outdoorsman said, "Go to <br/>
&gt; the Chalet". The<br/>
&gt; doughty explorer was startled, but undaunted turned south on the Pearl<br/>
&gt; Highway. Turning again on the valley parkway, the air was cool and<br/>
&gt; everything was green. The entry to the Chalet was 1 1/2 miles south. <br/>
&gt; 	Lifting a hand high to feel the breeze, the treasure <br/>
&gt; -seeker walked back<br/>
&gt; down the drive and across the road. The wind blew gently from <br/>
&gt; the north.<br/>
&gt; Turning into the wind and walking about 350 strides the tall traveler<br/>
&gt; came to a curiously worked piece of metal at the side of the <br/>
&gt; trail. The<br/>
&gt; adventurer turned 120d to follow the sound of a trickle of <br/>
&gt; water about 40<br/>
&gt; p to the base of a ridge. Tracks of the whitetail led up the <br/>
&gt; slope 50 P.<br/>
&gt; The tracks followed the ridge 150d for 20 P.  A small, furry, masked<br/>
&gt; scavenger scurried away at 80d to the base of a large tree <br/>
&gt; and vanished.<br/>
&gt; Another 15 p on the breeze twirled iridescent dust around the northern<br/>
&gt; fallen branch of a large oak, torn apart by the winds and storms.<br/>
&gt; Following the warming breeze along the fallen log, suddenly <br/>
&gt; all was very<br/>
&gt; still. <br/>
&gt; 	A sense of a missing piece of the puzzle in the silence made the<br/>
&gt; explorer search among the fallen logs. Hidden inside a piece of the<br/>
&gt; fallen tree was a message, the end of the vision, the beginning of an<br/>
&gt; adventure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	This is the first a letterbox series called "Emerald <br/>
&gt; Necklace". This box<br/>
&gt; is dedicated to a lifelong champion of the environment. The dedication<br/>
&gt; can be found in the inside front cover of the journal. The inspiration<br/>
&gt; came from finding an old fallen walnut tree along the river, <br/>
&gt; and reading<br/>
&gt; a Newsweek article in the Barbershop. <br/>
&gt; 	Watch for bees, poison ivy (3 leafs, hairy rope), <br/>
&gt; insects, and small<br/>
&gt; animals in these woods. Be cautious retrieving hidden objects. Be<br/>
&gt; prepared for the weather conditions, and take note of topography and<br/>
&gt; landmarks which will return you to your starting point. <br/>

&gt; clue. <br/>
&gt; 	Do your best to leave no trace as you use this park. <br/>
&gt; Take any trash with<br/>
&gt; you and dispose of it properly. do not harm wildlife or any <br/>
&gt; living thing,<br/>
&gt; or disturb local geology, geography or watershed. Respect the world we<br/>
&gt; live in and be a good steward. If you find trash , take it <br/>
&gt; out with you<br/>
&gt; and leave the woods and fields better than you find them. <br/>
&gt; Remember this<br/>
&gt; is for fun!<br/>
