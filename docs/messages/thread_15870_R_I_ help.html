this plea for help is a bit late so anyone who is not too busy may come <br/>
to our rescue.  Bluebird and I are traveling to the R.I. Gather from our <br/>
nests in Ct. and would love some help for suggestions of boxes along the <br/>
way that we may find before  arriving at the gather. We are mystified by <br/>
the lack of boxes listed on the R.I. map page . Trish, I know there are <br/>
some of yours in that area and can't find them.  Any and all help will <br/>
put a smile on our faces. :-)<br/>
Thanks, muchly  Butterfly in Ct,<br/>
