No, it's not a crappy stamp.  But it's not as nice as I'd have liked <br/>
it, so I'm labeling it an "okay" stamp.  Not to worry, though, I have <br/>
a crappy one that'll be coming out soon.  ;o)<br/>

     Can't wait for your less than 'okay' stamps to hit the region.  <br/>
Mine need some companions!  LOL  ;)<br/>
