                    <div class="plaintext-content">You know, I don't think enough can be said about the importance of re-<br/>
hiding boxes properly.  Not only does "sore rubbermaid" take the <br/>
challenge out of the search for the next group of Lb'ers, but it <br/>
obviously makes the box vulnerable to the mercy of just anyone <br/>
passing by.  And don't get me started on the problems caused by those <br/>
who do not seal boxes properly....  I've been lucky; my boxes have, <br/>
for the most part, been well-hidden and re-sealed, but I've seen some <br/>
beautiful, impecably done boxes almost trashed by a hasty re-<br/>
sealing.  <br/>
<br/>
We should treat the boxes we find with the same respect and care we <br/>
show those we place.<br/>
