The last two letterboxes I found were actually hybrid boxes - <br/>
geocaches and Letterboxes.  Pretty cool, if you ask me - a box <br/>
silently getting along with a split-personality.  I actually took a <br/>
trinket from one of them - an old Police Bus miniature truck - my <br/>
son-in-law is a police officer and collects such stuff.  I left a <br/>
lucky stone from my pocket in return.  My only complaint is that the <br/>
box was not labeled as a hybrid box, and probably should have been <br/>
labeled as such on both lbna and geocaching, and on the box itself - <br/>
obviously not everyone that does one knows about the other.  And to <br/>
confuse the issue even further, I left a hitchhiker with one of the <br/>
boxes - wonder if it will become a traveling bug?????<br/>

Here's a link to a Questing resource in the Northeast:<br/>

I have purchased one of their older Valley Quest books, completed some<br/>
quests, even hosted a workshop for educators on questing. I'd be happy<br/>
to answer questions as would several others on this board who are<br/>

<br/>
I believe Mark and Sue Pepe have found enough of the Valley Quest<br/>
boxes to earn a patch! Be sure to email Mark if you're interested, or<br/>
try one of their quests to see what the kids have created. I really<br/>
love the mapwork, it's a phenomenal way to get kids to think about<br/>
their natural environment.<br/>

Hey Simon! It's great to see your involvement on this letterboxing<br/>
board. I would love to be more involved with questing, but Maine is<br/>
still out of the loop so to speak. Have you been in contact with Peter<br/>
Zach from the MEEP program? (Maine Energy Education Program?) He and I<br/>
did a questing workshop together at Chewonki 2 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to our letterboxing community!<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

Maybe you ought to cross post this on the newboxers group.  I'd do <br/>
it, but I wouldn't want to do so without your permission.  It looks <br/>
like a great program, albeit very similar to boxing, not so much to <br/>
caching.<br/>

LB sites. The difference is my letterboxes still fit<br/>
the  letterbox definition i.e. no trinkets. I<br/>
specifically state that in my geocache pages (in bold<br/>
red font) and I also give plenty of info about what<br/>
letterboxing is and how to join in the fun. On my<br/>
cache pages, most have lat/long coords that take them<br/>
to the LB site but some only take them to the trail<br/>
head or almost to the site but then they need to use<br/>
directions to get the rest of the way. <br/>
<br/>
I'm apprehensive about hiding a true hybrid because I<br/>
think it might be confusing and increase the chance<br/>
that my handcarved stamp could be traded out. <br/>
<br/>
My oldest cache/LB is about a year old and so far so<br/>
good, my stamps haven't been traded out and no one has<br/>
left trinkets. Everyone seems to get what letterboxing<br/>
is and I've had a lot of positive comments from<br/>
geocachers. A few geocachers have carved their own<br/>
signature stamp. Some have had personal stamps made<br/>
and many have used store bought stamps that they've<br/>
adopted as their personal stamp. A couple have gone on<br/>
to plant a couple of cache/LB hybrids of their own.<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoy these treasure hunting games whether<br/>
it's letterboxing or geocaching (I'll have to find out<br/>
more about Questing). The geocaching and letterboxing<br/>
community in my area have been fantastic. I was happy<br/>
to see Simon's positive post and his motto, "My aim<br/>
here is to have happy hunters, no matter how we<br/>
hunt.".<br/>

It's not a coincidence that Atlas Quest uses the term Quest instead of<br/>
Letterboxing in it's name. ;o) http://www.atlasquest.com/aboutus/<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Based on the ValleyQuest site, it looks to me like the major addition <br/>
in Questing (aside from the spiritual / community aspect) is the <br/>
creation of a Map. Some of those Quests have very nicely drawn maps. <br/>
<br/>
To tell you the truth, I've seen some clues that could have benefited <br/>
from a map; after all, a picture is worth a thousand words.<br/>
<br/>
And in corresponding with JARS, I've come to the conclusion that I <br/>
will start registering a letterbox as a geocache hybrid wherever I <br/>
want to "stake a claim" to a special spot. Geocachers will respect a <br/>
certain perimeter, but how will they know about my box location <br/>
unless I publish it?<br/>

&gt; Here's a link to a Questing resource in the Northeast:<br/>
&gt; http://www.vitalcommunities.org/ValleyQuest/ValleyQuest.htm<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have purchased one of their older Valley Quest books, completed <br/>
some<br/>
&gt; quests, even hosted a workshop for educators on questing. I'd be <br/>
happy<br/>
&gt; to answer questions as would several others on this board who are<br/>
&gt; familiar with questing. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I believe Mark and Sue Pepe have found enough of the Valley Quest<br/>
&gt; boxes to earn a patch! Be sure to email Mark if you're interested, <br/>
or<br/>
&gt; try one of their quests to see what the kids have created. I really<br/>
&gt; love the mapwork, it's a phenomenal way to get kids to think about<br/>
&gt; their natural environment.<br/>

It's not a coincidence that Atlas Quest uses the term Quest instead of<br/>
Letterboxing in it's name. ;o) http://www.atlasquest.com/aboutus/<br/>

In a nutshell, there are no differences. That's why one of the<br/>
definitions I put for quest is "to letterbox". =)<br/>
<br/>
Everyone one of those quest clues could easily be called a letterbox<br/>
and no one would say boo about about it. So rather than picking a<br/>
domain name like "atlasletterboxing.com" (which is quite a mouthful!),<br/>
I picked "atlasquest.com" instead.<br/>
