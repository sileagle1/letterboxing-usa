<br/>
Letterboxing is a GREAT way to teach outdoor skills to<br/>
scouts, both boys and girls.  Just remember, you are<br/>
potentially placing someone else's labor of love and<br/>
care in harm's way when you take kiddos out to hunt<br/>
boxes.  Most of them will be fine letterboxers,<br/>
(although a number of them won't get into it too<br/>
much), but a certain percentage will mean well but be<br/>
careless anyway, and a very small percentage don't<br/>
mean well and are usually also sneaky!  Letterboxing<br/>
and Scouts make a great combination, but be mindful<br/>
that you are a responsible leader when you take them<br/>
out and only introduce them to bona fide boxes when<br/>
you are sure they understand fully what they are<br/>
doing, so that the reputation of scouts is such that<br/>
letterboxing continues to welcome them into the fold.<br/>
<br/>
Our den of boys (now 8 years old) got a taste of<br/>
letterboxing last year at a campout, when my 16 year<br/>
old daughter and I placed some temporary boxes and<br/>
gave them clues and sent them out in pairs with an<br/>
adult.  We started training them from the very<br/>
beginning to be considerate letterboxers and<br/>
naturalists, beginning the first steps of Leave No<br/>
Trace.  Since then, I've planted a box on every<br/>
excursion we've taken as a den, and they help me find<br/>
hiding places and figure out directions.  Even still,<br/>
I know I am only exposing my own boxes to potential<br/>
problems caused by their carelessness.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago, our whole pack went camping and<br/>
I was sitting at a table Saturday afternoon preparing<br/>
a box to plant.  I wound up with about 15 boys ranging<br/>
from 7-12 interested in what I was doing.  I let them<br/>
look at and try out my little collection of stamps<br/>
that seems to stay in the bottom of my carving box,<br/>
then I let them peruse my log book.  They were<br/>
especially fond of BabyBear's images.  They wanted to<br/>
know all about him and his boxes.  They wanted me to<br/>
tell them where his boxes are, but I told them I<br/>
couldn't tell them until I felt they were ready to<br/>
know - talk about enciting curiosity!!!  I promised<br/>
them that after we had really worked on being<br/>
responsible scouts AND letterboxers, I would take them<br/>
to find one of his boxes.  I emphasized that it would<br/>
only be WITH his permission and they would really have<br/>
to demonstrate to me that they can properly<br/>
demonstrate Leave No Trace and general thoughtfulness<br/>
as defined in letterboxing.  (There are a couple of<br/>
boys I won't even consider taking with me on that<br/>
sojourn.)  <br/>
<br/>
If you look in the archives of this list, you'll find<br/>
two or three threads (at least) revolving around<br/>
letterboxing with scouts.  They are all very<br/>
interesting, and you'll find there are several of us<br/>
on the list that combine the two pasttimes.  It is<br/>
definitely worth your time to hunt those threads down<br/>
and read them!  One of them was right about a year<br/>
ago, maybe 13 months or so...<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
