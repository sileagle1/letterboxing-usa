mandatory "retreat" in Hyannis for work.  On the bright side, it gave <br/>
me a chance to hunt some boxes during my free time.<br/>
<br/>
Oyster and Oyster Pearl were found in Osterville.<br/>
<br/>
The Letterbox at Nobsque Light and Secrets of the Knob were found in <br/>
Woods Hole.  I believe that Secrets of the Knob, placed 19981210, is <br/>
the oldest box I've found yet.  The log book is filled and I had to <br/>
stamp on the back of a page.<br/>
<br/>
Heron's Haven was found in Yarmouthport.<br/>
<br/>
Briar Patch #1 was found in East Sandwich.  I claim first finders on <br/>
this one, but unfortunately I was unable to find the other two in this <br/>
series.  There were many "five tree stands" but none of them seemed to <br/>
be in the right place.  And there were two stone walls "before moist," <br/>
neither of which I wanted to tear apart without some more specific <br/>
instructions.  Maybe the clue author could revise?<br/>
