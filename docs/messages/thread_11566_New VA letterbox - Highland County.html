Confederate Breastworks Historic Landmark<br/>
<br/>
Placed on March 29, 2003 by Sunvalleysu, daughter Jessiegirl and a <br/>
letterboxing co-addict (we have only just begun!) and her son.<br/>
<br/>
Near Staunton, VA take exit 225 off Interstate 81.  Follow the signs <br/>
for Monterey.  The route is West 275 and West 250. Stay with 250 and <br/>
continue to follow signs for Monterey.  At the top of Shenandoah <br/>
Mountain where Augusta County ends and Highland County begins you <br/>
will find the Confederate Breastworks.<br/>
<br/>
This was the site of Fort Edward Johnson where a detachment of some <br/>
3,000 Confederate soldiers dug a mile of trench and breastworks <br/>
(sort of a wall or levy built from logs) designed to thwart the <br/>
Union army's advance to Staunton. <br/>
<br/>
The Son of the South Letterbox is planted along the interpretive <br/>
trail which shares with you some letters written by Lt. Shepard <br/>
Green Pryor to his lovely wife Penelope.  Read about the Cold <br/>
Business of war and then  "Wee are faring badly" You are almost <br/>
there, take a rest on the bench and imagine the cold soldiers trying <br/>
to keep warm while listening for the enemy. <br/>
<br/>
Notice that the trail switches back with a "log cabin corner".  The <br/>
object of your search is under the outside corner.  After you stamp <br/>
in with the "Son" don't miss the view up the trail.  <br/>
