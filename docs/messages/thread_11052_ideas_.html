Not sure of the date.CT Maple syrup in small containers can be purchased at the General store in Mansfield Center. It will say somewhere on it that it is made in Mansfield. You can also get candles as good as yankee candle, down the road on the right just past the starting point of my Elliott Station starting point in Pomfret. She makes them in her home.There are signs outside of the house......Chuck and Molly
