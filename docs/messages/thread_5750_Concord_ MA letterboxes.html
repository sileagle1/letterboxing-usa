<br/>
I recently found my first two letterboxes in Estabrook woods and am <br/>
thoroughly enjoying the hunt.  What great stamps Docscience and GJourneys <br/>
created!  I'd like to find the other Concord boxes, but when I click on <br/>
"Moments to Celebrate" and "Squaw Sachem" the link takes me to a Mediaone <br/>
page and no clues.  Does anyone know anything about this?<br/>
<br/>
Am planning to place a couple of boxes with my daughters soon.  Letterboxing <br/>
adds a whole new dimension to walks with kids. They love the search.<br/>

&gt; Hi --<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I recently found my first two letterboxes in Estabrook woods and am <br/>
&gt; thoroughly enjoying the hunt.  What great stamps Docscience and <br/>
GJourneys <br/>
&gt; created!  I'd like to find the other Concord boxes, but when I <br/>
click on <br/>
&gt; "Moments to Celebrate" and "Squaw Sachem" the link takes me to a <br/>
Mediaone <br/>
&gt; page and no clues.  Does anyone know anything about this?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know exactly what is wrong with this.  There was a <br/>
letterboxing enthusiast here for a brief period of time (fall/winter <br/>
2001) by the name of WaldenRun.  WaldenRun had his/her clues posted <br/>
as a hyperlink.  There are at least 4 letterboxes that I know of that <br/>
WaldenRun placed - the two above, Piece of Cake, and Solitude (I <br/>
think).  WaldenRun used his/her mediaone.net ISP account to get to <br/>
the hyperlink.<br/>
<br/>
This spring, mediaone.net was bought out by attbi.com.  All <br/>
mediaone.net accounts and net branches were snuffed out.  All <br/>
mediaone.net users were supposed to update their net stuff.  (I know <br/>
all this because I fall under that category.)<br/>
<br/>
WaldenRun enthusiastically collected almost 300 finds of letterboxes <br/>
and has since moved on to geocaching.  When I noticed the same <br/>
problem that you noticed when looking to print out Piece of Cake, I <br/>
knew exactly why the problem was happening, so I emailed WaldenRun at <br/>
the new attbi.com address to let him/her know of the problem.  <br/>
Unfortunately, I have not received a reply in over a month.<br/>
<br/>
So if *anyone* clicks on a clue and gets this mediaone message, look <br/>
at your URL address line.  If it contains WaldenRun and mediaone.net, <br/>
then there is NOTHING WRONG WITH THE LBNA site; rather, it is the <br/>
hyperlink created by the letterboxer that is the problem.<br/>
<br/>
If any geocachers out there are in contact with WaldenRun, would you <br/>
kindly pass along this message for us all?  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this information helps, and I really wish that I could fix it <br/>
for you!<br/>
