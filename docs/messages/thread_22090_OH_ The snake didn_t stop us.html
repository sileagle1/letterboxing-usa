Ohio, my husband and I have a warning for future seekers of this LB. <br/>
The box's home seems also to be the home of a medium-sized gray snake. <br/>
I think we woke him (or her) up from a nap and it wasn't interested in <br/>
leaving the scene.<br/>
<br/>
This box is already precariously perched (no spoiler here- it's all <br/>
described in the clues), requiring one to choose between hanging over <br/>
a steel railing of a covered bridge, or approaching it from underneath <br/>
the bridge on a steep bank. Using teamwork with one gingerly poking <br/>
the box away from the snake with a walking stick and the other <br/>
catching it (the box, not the snake) before it fell into the creek, we <br/>
managed to get our "F". -Rose<br/>
