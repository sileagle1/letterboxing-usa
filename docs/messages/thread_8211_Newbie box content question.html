seems they are both a lot more common on the east coast.<br/>
<br/>
Because weather can be so fickle in the NW i would suggest not adding a <br/>
stamp pad, the chances of it being unusable for the duration of your <br/>
letterboxes life are pretty high.<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to leave a pen, i would suggest leaving something with oil <br/>
based ink, after my own disappointment today it was interesting to see that <br/>
water based inks and pencil either ran or were hard to read, but the notes <br/>
written in ball point pen were still perfectly legible.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes down to it Pacific NW boxers tend to be prepared with pad and <br/>
pen ready, no matter the box.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.<br/>

seems to be 1) a personal preference and 2) a regional difference. <br/>
Here in the RI and CT area, almost all boxes do have a pad with them. <br/>
In VA however, and as I understand it, in WA, most do not have pads. <br/>
So, it is really up to you.  <br/>
<br/>
As to pens or pencils, I would have to say pens...but I also generally<br/>
carry my own - and I think most boxers probably do.<br/>

     Welcome to letterboxing--it's great to see more NWers in <br/>
letterboxing!  I don't include stamp pads in my boxes (at $4 per <br/>
stamp pad it's way too expensive for me--especially at the rate my <br/>
boxes are going missing these days) but I do put a pen in all of my <br/>
boxes for those people who stumble across your letterbox <br/>
accidentally, so they can sign in.  I've had a few non-letterboxing <br/>
people find some of my boxes (for various reasons) and say they <br/>
signed in when they read the instructions.  If you make a micro-<br/>
letterbox, I simply put the 'guts' to the pen in the box.  You can <br/>
strip the 'innards' out of a Bic pen and they are flexible enough to <br/>
fit in a smaller container.  Also, you can fold down the end and <br/>
tape them so they stay shorter permanently.  If I have short pencils <br/>
lying around the house, I include them too (sometimes with a pencil <br/>
sharpener I received in the pack of 10 erasers/10 sharpeners I got <br/>
at the dollar store because I'll NEVER USE 10+ pencil sharpeners in <br/>
my lifetime).  Also, to save money on the letterboxes, buy the jumbo <br/>
packs of cheap pens at a dollar store--you can find 10 pens for <br/>
$0.99--same with the boxes and the notepads.  I trim the side bound <br/>
spiral memo pads in half and use those for the micro-letterboxes.  <br/>
I've put together letterboxes for less than $1.50 each (thanks to <br/>
thrift shops &amp; dollar stores) but of course my poorly carved stamps <br/>
are priceless.  ;)  (Or would it better be said--worthless)  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps a bit!<br/>

<br/>
Most boxes I've found don't have them, so I'd have to say no.  But if <br/>
you want to include a stamp pad, it's certainly not discouraged <br/>
either!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; does everyone tend to carry a pad along with them anyway?<br/>
<br/>
You have to for the boxes that don't have stamp pads!  Most people <br/>
typically don't write clues and say whether a pad is included or not, <br/>
so unless people forget them (it happens to the best of us), we're <br/>
usually carrying around pens, markers, and/or stamp pads.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; also, which is preferred? a pencil or a pen to log in<br/>
&gt; with?<br/>
<br/>
I prefer pen because it's more permanent than pencil.  But I rarely <br/>
ever leave ANY writing utensils in the letterboxes I place.  I always <br/>
assume that everyone carries around their favorite pens or whatever, <br/>
and nobody would ever find my well-hidden boxes by accident, so it's <br/>
not like I have to take them into consideration.  ;o)  (In case you <br/>
couldn't hear my sarcasism, my boxes DO get found accidentally on <br/>
occasion, but I still don't take them into consideration!  *smile*)<br/>

<br/>
Stamp pads in the box are totally optional.  I choose to put pads in my <br/>
boxes because I like to coordinate the colors to my letterbox stamp.  I have <br/>
a couple of letterboxes with pads that have already survived one NW winter <br/>
with no trouble.  I put pens in my boxes too.  The big trick is the baggies. <br/>
  I always bag my "messy stuff" separate from my "paper stuff".  That way, <br/>
if anything leaks or oozes... I'm still pretty safe.<br/>
