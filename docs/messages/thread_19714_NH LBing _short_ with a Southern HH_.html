spot! I just got back from a week in the White Mountains of NH with my <br/>
parents and my daughter - she's 7, so we were especially happy to find <br/>
another hike long enough to be fun for everyone, but short enough for <br/>
her little legs and my semi-gimpy leg. :-) Absolutely noone else <br/>
around, so no problem with secrecy and we were able to truly enjoy a <br/>
restful time on the rocks. In addition, this was my parents' first <br/>
experience with LBing and they really enjoyed it. They're big hikers, <br/>
so hopefully they'll get the LB bug. (I wish we'd been able to get the <br/>
LB that was OHSOCLOSE by, but little folks are entitled to a meltdown <br/>
now and then after a sleepless thunderstorm-enhanced night in a leaky <br/>
tent.....lol. As if we needed a reason to go back to the area......)<br/>
<br/>
In addition, we had a bit of extra excitement because nestled into the <br/>
LB was our very first HH! (Kudzu, which will be moved along soon.) I <br/>
can't express adequately how excited my daughter was in explaining the <br/>
HH to Nana and Pop. :-)<br/>
<br/>
So, thanks to both carvers and Happy Hiking to everyone!<br/>
