                    <div class="plaintext-content">On April 18, 2002 Funhog placed the Riverside Rest Letterbox in the <br/>
town of Redding, Shasta County, California. The Sacramento River flows <br/>
through Redding and can be a welcome spot for a picnic much of the <br/>
year. If you are traveling along the I-5 corridor, the short walk to <br/>
this letterbox can be just the thing for stretching your legs, watching <br/>
wildlife and perhaps catching a fish or two. If you happen to have more <br/>
than one color of ink with you, this stamp is two sided and lends <br/>
itself well to an overlay stamping extravaganza.<br/>
<br/>
to the trailhead: From Highway 299 west take the Auditorium Drive exit. <br/>
Follow the signs toward the Visitor Center. Immediately after crossing <br/>
back over the freeway you will  see a sign for the Turltle Bay main <br/>
entrance. Turn right on this gravel road. Go to the gate and park.<br/>
<br/>
to the letterbox: Walk through the gate and down the road. At the <br/>
criss-crossed, striped parallelograms bear right. You will pass a <br/>
wooden pole playing tic tac toe and a span that has taken a tumble. <br/>
When you see (and hear) the wailing wall across the current head due <br/>
west. Now is the time to be on the lookout for the rarest of gems, the <br/>
red diamond. Once you find this treasure, set your compass for 60 <br/>
degrees magnetic and head up the grassy knoll. With a pair of nearly <br/>
naked riverside sentinels on your left, the letterbox is on your right  <br/>
resting beneath pieces of bark.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On April 22, 2002 Funhog placed the Hog Lake Plateau Letterbox in <br/>
Tehama County near the town of Red Bluff, California. With a name like <br/>
this, it had to have one of my boxes. The location is wonderful in the <br/>
spring, covered with wildflowers, a vernal pond, egrets, woodpeckers <br/>
and a lot of cows. Beware the cowpies and poison oak. <br/>
<br/>
To the traihead: Go east from I-5 in Red Bluff to the junction of <br/>
Highways 36 and 99. Go 7 1/2 miles on 36 to the Hog Lake Plateau <br/>
parking area on the left side of the road.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: Walk north on the gravel road. When this road turns <br/>
to the west, leave the gravel and head uphill. Once on the plateau, <br/>
walk along the ridge towards the volcanoes. When you find yourself <br/>
standing between two neighbors felled by fire, set your compass for 320 <br/>
degrees magnetic. Follow this heading until you meet a third charred <br/>
victim. Change your course to 260 degrees and walk about 60 steps to <br/>
the bearer of blue berries. Circumnavigate this pungent friend until <br/>
you spot a flat rectangular rock at your feet. The letterbox rests <br/>
beneath.<br/>

Orick, Humboldt County, California.  Allow an hour for this excursion.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: About a mile north of Orick on Highway 101 turn west<br/>
at the sign for the Coastal Trail/Skunk Cabbage Trailhead. Follow this<br/>
road for 1/2 mile to the parking area.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: Cross nine bridges. Take twenty seven more steps.<br/>
The box awaits twenty five yards to the left, at the feet of a rufous<br/>
giant. <br/>

Well, I know she was on I-5 for part of her adventure at least.  <br/>
Vague reports about 'cursing my name' and such stuff after trying to <br/>
find my quickly becoming infamous Applegate Rest Area letterbox.  <br/>
Wrote me an e-mail saying she might go back the next day and look for <br/>
it, but I've heard nothing since...  =)<br/>
<br/>
However *I* did find the Redcrest Fairyland letterbox on my adventure <br/>
down Highway 101, in case you missed it in one of my earlier posts.  <br/>
This would have been November 26th, as I recall.  It was doing well <br/>
and dandy at that time!<br/>
