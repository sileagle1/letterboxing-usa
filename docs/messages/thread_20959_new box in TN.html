I've come to letterboxing from geocaching (although I do still do the <br/>
other  some)and so far I've only found 4.  The big problem is the <br/>
lack of boxes in middle TN.  But my main fun is sharing the hunts and <br/>
enjoying the stamps with my good friend Ann.  We both teach and find <br/>
this a true relaxation from the classroom.  Ann has been encouraging <br/>
me to try carving a stamp.  When her 18 yr old cat died recently I <br/>
gave it a try and I think it's not a bad job at least for a <br/>
beginner.  I have a container and a spot (even added a small copy of <br/>
Ol Possum's book of cats for meditation since there's a bench <br/>
nearby.  Guess I'm nervous about this but I don't really understand <br/>
how I go about "releasing" the box and letting others know about it.  <br/>
Can someone give me guidance on this?<br/>
