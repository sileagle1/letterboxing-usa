<br/>
Yesterday while 'boxing at Rocky Neck (East Lyme, CT) I found that Box # 1<br/>
had water in it.  I tried to dry it out as best I could.  The stamp and the<br/>
log book were still OK.  Only the info sheet was ruined.<br/>
<br/>
I was not able to find Box # 2 at all.  I searched for a long time and<br/>
finally gave up.  But I could have been looking in the wrong place, I don't<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
I located Box # 3 with no problem, but I found it covered with ants.  I<br/>
mean, *swarming* with them!  They had built their nest in the dirt under and<br/>
around the sides of the box.  It was disgusting to watch them scurrying to<br/>
save their ugly little white eggs!  I felt that I had to replace the box in<br/>
the same place or else no one else would be able to find it.  Maybe I<br/>
stirred them up enough that they will go build their nest elsewhere!<br/>
<br/>
Also in Box # 3, the cover of the ink pad is broken, with one side entirely<br/>
missing.<br/>
