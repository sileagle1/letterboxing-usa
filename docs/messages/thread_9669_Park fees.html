                    <div class="plaintext-content">State Park Fees--an explanation.<br/>
A couple of years ago there was a statewide initiative that the <br/>
citizens of Washington State voted on to eliminate excessive car <br/>
tab fees.  The initiative passed and every vehicle in the state <br/>
(theoretically) was from then on charged a flat rate of $30 per <br/>
year for licensing.  Local governments then began to charge <br/>
various fees to suppliment the moneys they lost but overall the <br/>
$30 license tabs stuck.  This caused a huge dent in the state <br/>
coffers.  Liberal politicians and beaurocrats began whining <br/>
about the lost revenue and how this would destroy much <br/>
progress in fighting hunger, poor health conditions, school <br/>
lunches, etc.  The politicians were forced to begin to cut <br/>
spending and one of the first things they did was cut funding to <br/>
the state parks system as a punishment of sorts to the voters for <br/>
passing the initiative.  Many parks were closed altogether and <br/>
many more were slated for seasonal closures.  Use fees began <br/>
to be implemented to help pay for maintenance and salaries of <br/>
skeleton staff.  <br/>
Since the original initiative passed, the state courts overturned <br/>
the initiative calling it unconstitutional.  Smart legislators heard <br/>
the people speak at the polls and quickly passed legislation in <br/>
the state house and senate to cut the tab fees to the $30 limit.  <br/>
Other initiatives have been run and more progress has been <br/>
made from a consumers standpoint on cutting onerous taxes at <br/>
the state level.  But the politicians and beauraucrats just keep <br/>
whining.  We now have been informed (no public vote was <br/>
offered) by the beauraucrats in the state parks department  that <br/>
there must be these expensive use fees in order to save the <br/>
parks system.  <br/>
<br/>
Although I dont agree with the methods that the Washington <br/>
State Parks system used to arrive at this move, and I certainly <br/>
dont agree with the state courts on the ruling that the car tab <br/>
initiative is unconstitutional,  I do believe in use fees.  The people <br/>
who use the parks should support the parks.  Unfortunately, this <br/>
will limit many peoples access or at least discourage it.  It is a <br/>
shame that it had to come to this.  My family will purchase an <br/>
annual permit to access all the parks in the state.  We will <br/>
probably do the same for Oregon Parks as there are many <br/>
letterboxes within a days drive of us here in Olympia, WA.  Many <br/>
other people who may be interested in letterboxing may not be <br/>
able to afford this however, and that is just really a shame.  <br/>
<br/>
I call on all letterboxers in the Washington and Oregon areas <br/>
(and other states too) to continue to place new boxes in city <br/>
parks and other municipal areas that do not have access fees in <br/>
order to keep the sport affordable to new participants.  Dont stop <br/>
placing boxes in the state parks or other areas requiring access <br/>
or entry or parking fees but be considerate of those folks who <br/>
cannot afford the $50 or $70 per year or $5 per day fees.  <br/>
Sometines it is well worth the fee to get to a great box or better <br/>
yet a great location box or not.  But still, we must be considerate.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, and when you purchase a daily pass in a FL state park, it is <br/>
good only for the park you purchased it at.  If you go down the road <br/>
to another park, you must purchase another $3-5 day pass.<br/>
<br/>
In MI a daily state park pass is $5, but it will get you into as many <br/>
parks as you can get to in a day.  Better yet, the yearly remains a <br/>
bargain at $20.<br/>

                    <html><body><p>I must try to share a bit of perspective from someone who lives surrounded by Acadia National Park.  Those of us who are fortunate to have parks in our backyards also have to share them with those who are not so fortunate.  As more areas are eaten up by development, the parks become even more popular.  Acadia has the highest ratio of visitors per square mile of any National Park in the country.  The number of visitors coming to our parks every year is huge.  This has a tremendous impact on the natural setting and the infrastructure.  Add to this the staffing required to adequately oversee these areas and there is not adequate funding from taxation to take care of these issues.  And we won't even consider the costs of sending out the search and resuce team every time someone decides they don't want to follow the trail, would rather make their own and fall down the side of a mountain.  The point is,  if we want to have these areas preserved for our enjoyment and that of our children and grandchildren, we have to help provide financial support.  Yes,  I swallow when I pay a park fee (especially here on the island - afterall, this is MY home), but most day fees are not much more than I would pay for a 2-hour video, which would not be nearly as beneficial for my body, spirit and soul.  Maybe annual park passes should be appearing on people's holiday gift lists!

<br/>
That is a great gift idea!  Only problem is that here in Michigan <br/>
they are very strange about the purchase of vehicle permits -- you <br/>
can only purchase them at the parks (not online, or via mail/phone) <br/>
and they make you adhere them to the vehicle window at the time of <br/>
purchase.  Once I had a rental while my vehicle was in for repair and <br/>
they would not allow me to purchase a yearly sticker and hold onto it <br/>
to place on my own vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
They have a phobia that people will try to rip them off and share the <br/>
sticker between vehicles, which is probably a valid concern.  <br/>
Personally I feel that if I purchase a yearly pass I should be able <br/>
to use it in whichever vehicle I decide to back out of the garage <br/>
that day...<br/>
<br/>
I do like the gift idea though and may try it for my kids.  It will <br/>
be interesting to see what they do when I purchase 4 yearly permits.  <br/>
Obviously they wouldn't make me put them all on the vehicle I am in!<br/>

I just posted an idea for group fundraising and sponsorship of <br/>
newbies.  I like your idea, Bill.  I would very much be in support of <br/>
