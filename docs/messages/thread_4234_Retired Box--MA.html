removed and the clue page has been taken off the Web. <br/>

it completely filled up!  Thanks to everyone who visited the <br/>
fledglings. I really enjoyed everyone's stamps and notes. I was so <br/>
happy that so many kids had visited and that it had become a <br/>
community box. There were visitors from all parts of the USA, Canada, <br/>
England, and Brazil. It would be great if a new box appeared in the <br/>
area!<br/>
