and raised their fearful cry,<br/>
as six cursed maids rose from the depths<br/>
with fury in their eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Around each brow spun motes of light<br/>
from souls lost to Their pow'r,<br/>
Yet challenged He the mighty horde<br/>
though other men would cower.<br/>
<br/>
His war-steed reared and balked with fear<br/>
as Eastward ran the charge<br/>
of legion North and legion South,<br/>
their armor worn and marred.<br/>
<br/>
South sped He along the line,<br/>
eight battlements lined with spears,<br/>
His courage, grace and fearless words<br/>
leant solace to their fear.<br/>
<br/>
Yet one boy hid amongst the throng<br/>
of fourteen lancemen brave<br/>
whose pounding heart, awash with tears,<br/>
was crying to be saved.<br/>
<br/>
The noble Sir then spied the lad<br/>
and raced, quick, to his side:<br/>
down marble stairs, right 'round the bend<br/>
and fifth man in the line.<br/>
