Curiously, in the last couple of years it seems that hitch hikers<br/>
have taken on a new personna. Originally, they were travelling <br/>
letterboxes that moved from box to box, stamped only by the <br/>
person who found it and moved it on.<br/>
<br/>

Unfortunately, this has not proven to be the case. <br/>
<br/>
Rarely, have I heard a peep from finders of my hitchers. Recently,<br/>
I had one of my babies come home to me. Opening it up to see <br/>
where it had been, I learned that it had lain idle for nine months <br/>
in someone's backpack. Then it had gone to two gatherings in <br/>
succession, filling page after page with signature stamps of<br/>
folks that hadn't actually found it.  It traveled around for a while<br/>
gathering stamps in the manner of a personal traveler. Finally, <br/>
it hit four letterboxes before it made it's way back to me after <br/>
nearly two years in the wild. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, the log wasn't really "full" at all. It was made from blank<br/>
index cards, suitable for stamping on both sides. Only about a third <br/>
of the pages were used front and back.  I'm feeling like the Hitch <br/>

If the placers don't mind, like most of these we are taking to England, then that's a different story but an unusual circumstance, as these were mailed to me with the proviso that this would be their destiny.<br/>
Any other HH found on the trail should be treated with respect to the normal etiquette from "back in the day."<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My opinion for what it's worth:<br/>
<br/>
If someone finds a HH but won't be able to re-place it within a <br/>
reasonable period of time (a few weeks at most), then they shouldn't <br/>
take it.  Anjabanja and my philosophy regarding this is spelled out <br/>
on our website:<br/>
<br/>
"... Hitchhikers found by us may not necessarily be placed in the <br/>
next letterbox we find, may be left in the letterbox in which we <br/>
found it, or may be included in a letterbox we plant.  In any event, <br/>
we promise not to hold on to a hitchhiker for an unreasonable period <br/>
of time and will faithfully relocate it so it can be enjoyed by other <br/>
letterboxers."<br/>
<br/>
Keeping the HH in a backpack for 9 months was irresponsible <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Taking it to a gathering was also irresponsible letterboxing.  HHs <br/>
are not personal travellers, nor are they designed for the purpose <br/>
your HH was used for.  None of the 'boxers who stamped the log at the <br/>
gathering should count it as a find.  They probably thought they were <br/>
exchanging stamps with the person who brought the thing anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Sending the book back to you with some pages not stamped is perhaps <br/>
part of the challenge of placing letterboxers.  I've noticed that <br/>
many 'boxers don't always stamp in on the next page.  We stamp in <br/>
order, so if a page or two has been skipped, it remains skipped.  <br/>
This one you may have to deal with, place a new logbook in the box, <br/>
and send it out again (unless you intend to retire it).<br/>
<br/>
But the other uses of your HH were improper, IMHO anyway.<br/>

I love the idea of HHs as you put forth. My son<br/>
launched one a month or so ago, heard from the FF but<br/>
not a peep since.  I hope maybe people will take a<br/>
little more care. There are alot  more people out<br/>
there boxing now, how many are carving? I think if you<br/>
take the time to carve a stamp maybe you are more<br/>
careful with stamps in the wild.<br/>

 P.S. I'm from PA but found your Saguaro Sunset a few<br/>
years ago.<br/>

Your note about putting it on newcomers list is great. I would also recommend that it be listed on individual websites - the main ones that list information and how-to. I don't recall seeing that stated so obviously anywhere before. <br/>

Summer.  We purposefully put it in a box we knew is often visited so <br/>
that it would be found quickly.  We were thrilled when we received <br/>
an email saying it was picked up the next day &amp; travelling elsewhere <br/>
in the US.  Since then- not a peep.  I've sent notices on this list <br/>
&amp; the traveller's list asking if anyone's seen it (my kids are dying <br/>
to know) &amp; nothing.  I even emailed the person who found to ask them <br/>
if/where they planted it so that perhaps I could "direct" someone to <br/>
it &amp; never heard back from them.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm not holding out much hope of seeing my first HH again.  BUT, I'm <br/>
going to try again &amp; this time I think I'll take someone else's <br/>
advice &amp; add a "no gatherings" clause on it just in case.  I agree- <br/>
travel is the intention; it's not a party favor.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with you wholeheartedly. I want my HH's to TRAVEL...but I must say<br/>
that before I thought about the Golden Rule (Treat others as you would like<br/>
to be treated....etc) of letterboxing, I, too, was guilty of stamping into<br/>
the many HH's at gatherings. I don't think anyone would deny the terrible<br/>
temptation to go stamp crazy at a gathering when they are sitting on a table<br/>
right in front of you.<br/>
<br/>
One solution to this, I have found, is to have a HH hostel at gatherings. So<br/>
that you can trade off a HH you bring to the gathering for a new one. The<br/>
one caveat is that you HAVE to police the hostel vigilantly, because there<br/>
are those who just don't get the concept and want to take one out, stamp in,<br/>
put it back and take another, stamp in etc. to maximize the stampage! For<br/>
those of you who do that....tsk tsk...that's a very inconsiderate loophole.<br/>
<br/>
I don't doubt that it is cool to see a lot of stamps in your HH log, but to<br/>
find that your HH has only visited 4 places and that most of the stamps are<br/>
ones of people you know, that's no fun at all.<br/>
<br/>
If I may give a personal example, my Pusmobile HH was planted in memory of<br/>
my late husband (in the image of his infamous electro green truck, the<br/>
Pusmobile) in the hope that it would travel to all the places he never got<br/>
to go. If it came back to me with most of its pages stamped on one day at<br/>
some gathering, I would be really disappointed and sad...not to mention<br/>
really irritated.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I will bed putting a "no gatherings" request in any future HH's<br/>
I launch...I wish I had done it with the existing ones.<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully,<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] HH etiquette<br/>
<br/>
When I first started letterboxing, I carefully read everything in<br/>
the LbNA FAQs to learn about this wonderful hobby, including<br/>
hitch hikers...<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html#027<br/>
Curiously, in the last couple of years it seems that hitch hikers<br/>
have taken on a new personna. Originally, they were travelling<br/>
letterboxes that moved from box to box, stamped only by the<br/>
person who found it and moved it on.<br/>
<br/>
This seemed incredibly cool to me. I envisioned my little creation<br/>
eventually coming home to me filled with stamps from letterboxes<br/>
and boxers from all over the place. I thought I would get frequent<br/>
reports of their whereabouts as they traveled the world.<br/>
Unfortunately, this has not proven to be the case.<br/>
<br/>
Rarely, have I heard a peep from finders of my hitchers. Recently,<br/>
I had one of my babies come home to me. Opening it up to see<br/>
where it had been, I learned that it had lain idle for nine months<br/>
in someone's backpack. Then it had gone to two gatherings in<br/>
succession, filling page after page with signature stamps of<br/>
folks that hadn't actually found it.  It traveled around for a while<br/>
gathering stamps in the manner of a personal traveler. Finally,<br/>
it hit four letterboxes before it made it's way back to me after<br/>
nearly two years in the wild.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the log wasn't really "full" at all. It was made from blank<br/>
index cards, suitable for stamping on both sides. Only about a third<br/>
of the pages were used front and back.  I'm feeling like the Hitch<br/>
Hiker Curmudgeon right now. Am I the only one who is<br/>
disappointed by this change in the identity and etiquette of HH<br/>
letterboxes?  whine, whine, whine...Funhog<br/>

replace it but that was because I was going to Cape Cod and wanted <br/>
to remove it from CT where it had been for its whole life. I hope <br/>
that was ok and did not upset the owner.  I do agree that signing in <br/>
at a gathering seems inapproprate.  I also feel placing it in a well <br/>
traffiked area seem like the best idea so what better then a <br/>

time about it (thank you, Von Der Insels) but definitely not as much <br/>
as I would have liked.  Although Wanda and Pete's HH page usually <br/>
has more info than I do! It's sad too because it makes me not want <br/>
to place anymore and if we all felt like that then no one would ever <br/>
get that cool little thrill when you find one in a box!<br/>
<br/>
As far as the holding on to it thing, I actually found one on my <br/>
first time out.  I was going to Oregon about a month later and <br/>
thought that it would be really cool to be able to move it from <br/>
Massaschusetts all the way out there.  So, I contacted the placer <br/>
and asked if the wait was ok.  She agreed so I waited!  But, <br/>
normally, I wouldn't do that.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it's really confusing for finders, too, when a HH has been <br/>
stamped at a gathering.  I letterbox in three states and so I <br/>
usually like to see where it has been and move it somewhere else.  I <br/>
can tell you that out of the 9 HH's that most of them have page <br/>
after page of stamps that have no indication of where those people <br/>
found them....can't tell you how many I've found that weren't <br/>
recorded in the parent box, too!<br/>

general pile at a gathering. (Wouldn't even look at them because that would<br/>
spoil my future surprise if I should happen to find one in a letterbox.)<br/>
Similarly, I have no interest in a HH Hostel since it doesn't include the<br/>
randomness and surprise aspect that I think is one of the key components of<br/>
finding a HH.<br/>
<br/>
When we started letterboxing a little over a year ago, I read a lot of info<br/>
on various websites and came across Pete &amp; Wanda's HH page.  It has<br/>
therefore always been our practice to notify the original launcher of the HH<br/>
(if the email address is still valid!) AND Pete whenever we find a HH.  I<br/>
like to do this since we can then theoretically see where a HH we've found<br/>
has traveled to after we found it.<br/>
