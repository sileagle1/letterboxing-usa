Just wanted to say hi.  My husband and I and our five small children found our first letterbox (Governor Dick Letterbox in Lebanon County PA) last weekend and can't wait to get more!  We are in Lancaster County so are looking to get Bridges of Lancaster tomorrow if the weather holds out.  My best friend lives in Maine and I have her hooked just by our great experience!  [I have been telling everybody I know about this great activity, even my homeschool e-groups!]  I wish we had known about this sooner...We were at Multnomah Falls and in the Portland OR area in January!  Well, guess we will need to plan another trip west!<br/>

Hope you have as much looking for the Bridges of Lancaster box as I <br/>
had planting it!  Except watch out for flying chickens!  I kid you <br/>
not, about halfway through the tour, a Rhode Island Red chicken came <br/>
flying out of a farmer's driveway into the side of my vehicle and <br/>
busted my side mirror!  Would love to hear from you once you find the <br/>
box!<br/>

  I think it would be fun and interesting from an artistic perspective-creating the design and making the stamps, from orienteering, mapreading, respecting your environment, etc, and might spark some interest in some of these other aspects.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My son and I found our first letterboxes on Monday, then after <br/>
&gt; we picked up my daughter from girl scout day camp, we found <br/>
&gt; another. Turns out there is even a badge for Girl Scouts for <br/>
&gt; letterboxing and/or geocaching.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I've really been enjoying reading the different clues and <br/>

a good option for troops...... Have them be responsible for  <br/>
maintenance for as long as makes sense for your group, then pull the  <br/>
box if you don't want permanent responsibility. :-)<br/>

&gt; I'm thinking about letterboxing from the finding them standpoint  <br/>
&gt; for our troop.  They are older girls though-12/13.  If we planted  <br/>
&gt; any, I'd be responsible for maintaining them with my daughter and son.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I think it would be fun and interesting from an artistic  <br/>
&gt; perspective-creating the design and making the stamps, from  <br/>
&gt; orienteering, mapreading, respecting your environment, etc, and  <br/>
&gt; might spark some interest in some of these other aspects.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Welcome to letterboxing!  I've only been involved for a year or <br/>
&gt; so, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but have loved every minute of it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm curious about the girl scout badge for letterboxing... I'm <br/>

&gt; &gt; to be a brownie troop leader this coming fall and definitely <br/>
want <br/>
