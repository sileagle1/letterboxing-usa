We're looking forward to many weekends searching out letterboxes and <br/>
planting new ones along the way. Stay tuned for our upcoming letterbox <br/>
series based on my family history in Rhode Island (Kent Bros. Dairy, Kent <br/>
Heights, Kent Heights General Store, etc.) Also looking forward to enjoying <br/>
some brown eggs, johnny cakes, coffee milk frappes, bubblahs, etc. :-)<br/>
<br/>
However, this means our Boca boxes (loggerhead, boca friends and tiki idol) <br/>
will become orphans :-(<br/>
We'll probably only be able to get down south once a year to check on them, <br/>
but perhaps others could look in on them for us and give us an occasional <br/>
update.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if anyone in the Providence/Boston/Worcester area knows of a company <br/>
looking for an Art Director/Graphic Designer, please let me know!<br/>

Yay!  It's always good to hear of someone moving *to* the Ocean <br/>
State.  It's usually the other way around!  And of course, the <br/>
promise of new boxes -- and boxers -- is welcome as well!<br/>
