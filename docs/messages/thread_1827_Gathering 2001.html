<br/>
Start at the beginning. Carolyn, thank you very much for the most excellent <br/>
job you did hosting our gathering. All of the extra lengths you went to <br/>
made a great day even greater. The on-site boxes and the games involved as <br/>
well as the surprises were ingenious. An extra round of applause for Carolyn.<br/>
	Beth and Allen, the chili was great, really great, the hotter the better. <br/>
I thought the potato soup was great too, even if Matthew wasn't too keen on <br/>
it. 11 year old boys, sheesh. No real appreciation for food yet.<br/>
	We got 29 exchanges from the event. We got to meet the man who leaves all <br/>
this stuff around for us to find, Jay Drew. We got to meet Eric Eurto, who <br/>
placed the first letterbox we ever found. Not to be confused with the first <br/>
letterbox we looked for. Which we didn't find. We hoped to meet Dan and <br/>
Melissa, but we missed them as we were likewise in and out, before leaving <br/>
early. No doubt being the first to find another new letterbox. My daughter, <br/>
Katie, really wanted to meet them. Perhaps, we shall meet you both on the <br/>
trail someday, when we're coming back from a letterbox!  :-)<br/>
	Echoing what the others said, it was a great idea, wonderfully executed, <br/>
attended by a really nice group of people. I see no reason not to do it <br/>
again. Thanks to all for making it so fun.<br/>
<br/>

ooh, ooh, somebody had a cool cover with the letterbox logo on it, for <br/>
their stamp book. A creative group.<br/>
