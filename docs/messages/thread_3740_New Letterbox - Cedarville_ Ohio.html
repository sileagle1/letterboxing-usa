<br/>
This is a hybrid letterbox/geocache where the purpose is introducing <br/>
geocachers to letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Following are similar to the instructions given on the <br/>
www.geocaching.com website.  Finding this letterbox will require a <br/>
GPS unit.<br/>
<br/>
"This Geocache search will give you a taste of letterboxing.  It <br/>
covers much of Greene County Ohio and is not for the faint of heart.  <br/>
Patience Grasshopper<br/>
<br/>
Enough already! Here are the instructions for the Geocache  I expect <br/>
it will take most folks about a week to do this one.  But don't give <br/>
up!  The tasks and travel can be broken into several parts.  And the <br/>
final cache location is an extraordinarily beautiful setting.<br/>
<br/>
Overview: First thing you need to do is go to the <br/>
www.letterboxing.org website and learn a little about letterboxing.  <br/>
The coordinates for finding this Geocache are in the log book of a <br/>
regular letterbox I have hidden just outside Beavercreek.  <br/>
<br/>
Detail: This is what you do<br/>
1.	Get, buy, or make a personal stamp to leave an imprint in the <br/>
logbook of letterboxes.  Making a stamp is really very easy (and <br/>
addicting,) but no one will fault you if you buy a stamp with a <br/>
picture that means something to you.  You can also have a <br/>
commercially prepared stamp made.   The idea is that the stamp <br/>
represents something special to you.  While you are at it, get a log <br/>
book to carry with you and record the stamps found in letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
2.	Follow the instructions in the letterboxing website to find <br/>
the recently placed Ankeney Wetlands letterbox.  You will not need <br/>
your GPS to find this letterbox, but will need to count steps and use <br/>
a little deductive reasoning.<br/>
<br/>
3.	Go to the letterbox, stamp the log there with your stamp and <br/>
use the stamp there to stamp your letterboxing logbook.  (Honor <br/>
system applies  This is no fun unless you really do the above.)  <br/>
Don't be too disappointed no toys at this box, just a stamp and log.<br/>
<br/>
4.	Get the GPS coordinates written on the inside of the cover of <br/>
the letterbox log.<br/>
<br/>
5.	Go to those GPS coordinates which are somewhere near <br/>
Cedarville.<br/>
<br/>
The only hints you get for the Cedarville piece are:<br/>
-	you need never go more than 50 feet off a path and <br/>
-	when you arrive, you will find yourself in an enclosure about <br/>
the size of a garage or barn.  Explore the base of the south wall.  <br/>
You need only move three rocks.<br/>
<br/>
Now for a little surprise The geocache in Cedarville is a <br/>
cache/letterbox hybrid like many of my caches.  It contains toys for <br/>
boys and girls of all ages as well as a stamp and log book. The stamp <br/>
for this letterbox is a Letterboxing North America stamp I made.<br/>
