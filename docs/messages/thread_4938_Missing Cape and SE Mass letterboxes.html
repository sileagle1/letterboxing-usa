                    <div class="plaintext-content">We also have been looking for the same 3 letterboxes:  Ned's Pt, <br/>
Clark's Pt and Nobska.  I know that Nobska is definitely missing, as <br/>
we found the exact spot and there was NOTHING in there!  We've looked <br/>
at Ned's Pt on and off for over a month, trying variations of the <br/>
directions as far as degrees and paces.  There's nothing there.  I <br/>
think it may have been buried when some stone work was done there this <br/>
winter.  The box at Clark's Pt has more problems, because the <br/>
directions to the two lighthouses (Clark's Pt and Butler Flats) appear <br/>
to be reversed.  Nevertheless, trying all possibilities we couldn't <br/>
find it.<br/>

I have not been able to check their location to verify their status.<br/>
I do know that the Nobska Light box is very difficult to find. Ned's Point<br/>
and Clark's Point are what I classify as drivebys.<br/>
I will check these sometime in May.<br/>
