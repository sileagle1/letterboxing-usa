Please revise the clues to the Wings of Peace letterbox to reflect <br/>
that the search begins at the visitor center next to the ranger <br/>
station.<br/>

Wings of Peace<br/>
<br/>
Location: Winton Woods, Winton Road, Cincinnati, Ohio<br/>
Directions: Take I-275 to Winton Road-Forest Park exit, south on <br/>
Winton Road to park entrances on left and right. Also accessible via <br/>
Ronald Reagan-Cross County Highway to Winton Road exit, north on <br/>
Winton Road to park entrances.<br/>
Level: Easy find, easy trail<br/>
Need: Stamp, stamp pad, pen.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Begin at the visitor center next to the ranger station, at <br/>
the Hike-Bike Trail. Begin walking east. Around the bend you will <br/>
come to a fork where you will go left. Continue walking to the next <br/>
fork where you will again go left. Cross over the bridge and continue <br/>
on the trail along the lake. Pass by the 2 benches and follow the <br/>
curves - see the shelterhouse up on the hill? At the bottom of the <br/>
hill look to your right to the end of the fence. There are 2 logs at <br/>
the east end of the fence. Next to the hill behind the eastmost log <br/>
you will find what you seek. Be discreet  this is a busy trail. You <br/>
may continue on around the lake for a really nice walk, or return the <br/>
way you came.<br/>
