&gt; mind spelling it out for me? Something like "drewclan at aol.com"<br/>

P.S. I've finished the basics of my webpage and showed it to my class<br/>
everyone loved it. it came out really well. Now all I've got to do is<br/>
start adding boxes. If you've placed any in either Windham or Tolland<br/>
counties and would like me to add them I'll be happy to. right now I've<br/>
got the one I placed. If you would rather they just be at LBNA that's ok<br/>
to. My project was to create an easy to navigate, easy to print, webpage<br/>
with only local boxes. I'm also thinking of addind future pictures to<br/>
help people find the parking lots. We've gotten lost more than once.<br/>
Some roads that lead to wonderful hikes aren't clearly marked. (like<br/>
everyone in the town knows where it is but no one else does.)<br/>
