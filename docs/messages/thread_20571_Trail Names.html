Make up your own rules!  It keeps everyone on their toes!  Besides, <br/>
it's YOUR identity - make it unique to YOU.  And there's nothing to <br/>
say that you can't have more than one identity if you box under more <br/>
than one circumstance.<br/>
<br/>
When I box alone (or with an ad hoc bunch of boxers), I box as <br/>
Warrior Woman, with its own unique stamp.  That is my singular <br/>
identity, and is how just about everyone knows me, and is the <br/>
identity I use when I place boxes, so it's an easy search when <br/>
looking for my boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I do, however, have a regular boxing companion, Tatanka (this has <br/>
been within the last six months or so).  When I box with Tatanka, we <br/>
box as a team, The DreamCatchers, and I box as Lakota, with *its* own <br/>
unique stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Just to make trouble ;-)<br/>

 You really don't want to put your real name in a<br/>

happy that you signed in at all, and I wouldn't care what name you <br/>
used.  When I take a friend who does not box on a regular basis, I have <br/>
a stamp that my daughter carved and let them use that.  They just sign <br/>
their name by it, but I think it's fun for them to have a stamp to use, <br/>
and it's nice for the log book to have a bit of color as well.  I've <br/>
been thumb prints made by people who didn't have a stamp (a park ranger <br/>
or botanist or something similar who happened to find the box and left <br/>
his print and a nice note - he rubbed his thumb on a green leaf to get <br/>
the "ink).  I've also run across boxes that geocachers had found and <br/>
signed in with the date and their names, but they didn't use a stamp <br/>
because that's not what they do.  If it were my box, I would like to <br/>
know if geocachers were finding it regularly, because I might want to <br/>
move it.  Personally I think a more important thing is to carry along <br/>
with you a few paper towels for absorbing moisture from a leaky box, and <br/>
some zip-lock baggies to replace those that might be damaged.  It's <br/>
called first aid, and people appreciate it.  It's also nice to contact <br/>
people to let them know the condition of their box, although I don't <br/>
think everyone does that regularly.  I would be sad to know someone <br/>
visited my box and didn't at least make an X or something to show they <br/>
were there.   Probably more answer than you wanted, but it's my own two <br/>
cents.  You can read the FAQ at www.letterboxing.org and/or <br/>
www.atlasquest.com and learn a lot about the etiquette involved.  It's <br/>
my impression so far that some boxers guard their personal identity like <br/>
a hawk, even hiding their gender; others don't care who knows their real <br/>
name.  I think if your wife doesn't care for the idea of using a trail <br/>
name she should just use her own name - in time if she visits a lot of <br/>
boxes, she will probably change her mind and figure out a trail name for <br/>
herself anyway.  Some people think things like that are silly at first <br/>
but maybe later on realize it's just good clean fun, especially for <br/>
children, and there is a lot of child in most of us.<br/>
<br/>
The first boxers I met in person were a woman and her 7-year-old <br/>
daughter.  When we finished our hike, her daughter asked me "what should <br/>
we call you"?  I thought she said "when should we call you" and told her <br/>
"oh just call me anytime!"  I later realized she was wanting to know my <br/>
trail name, and I made mine up right then so she could use it next time <br/>
we meet.  And my trail name sure isn't "anytime"! <br/>

Whatever you're comfortable with.<br/>
Many just stamp and date. Which is OK, because when you keep finding <br/>
the same stamp, you seem to know the person, even if all you know is <br/>
what they stamp with. "Oh look, that eye person was here... and so was <br/>
X..."<br/>
Some have trail names, and some of us just use our names. Whatever.<br/>
If you really want trail names, and your wife can't think of one, why <br/>
not just go as mr. &amp; mrs. "trailname", or the "trailname" team, squad, <br/>

&gt; name?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, what is the protocol for signing a log book? <br/>
&gt; Is it JUST trail <br/>
&gt; name, or can you put an actual name in the book? <br/>
&gt; And if you're with <br/>
&gt; friends or family who are NON-letterboxers, can they<br/>
&gt; sign their names?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; New to the hobby, I just want to do the right<br/>
&gt; things.<br/>
