&gt;I have been in the Security business for 32 years (until retirement),anInvestigator for 41 years,and I believe it would be foolish to put personalinformation inside a letterbox. There are many women letterboxers in our hobbyand to advise them and others to use other than "Contact the Placer"functions is not very prudent. The "Contact the Placer" functionallows for a certain degree of protection and since it works easily for thosethat wish to report on the letterboxes status it should be considered as themain communication tool. It does require the receiver of the message to actuallywrite the sender directly rather than just clicking on "Reply" but sowhat.

I just think  using your home address and your email address is a <br/>
little foolish when the "Contact the Placer " function works so well.<br/>
Finding out someone's address from any phone number whether or not <br/>
it is a cell phone,non pub.home phone is not a very difficult <br/>
problem. I have not tried to break down an email address but I'm <br/>
fairly sure it would be possible. PO Box-simple. Every one can <br/>
certainly list and include  what ever they wish to in their <br/>
letterbox, but when some one on this list advocates leaving a home <br/>
address or a email address in answer to a question posed by another <br/>
I felt it necessary to comment.<br/>
I think the number and locations of our letterboxes is a response to <br/>
your comment about leaving our house.<br/>

I tend to side a bit more with the cautious crowd.  Yes, indeed, I am very<br/>
easily trackable by email if someone chooses to put forth a moderate effort.<br/>
However, I choose to put my email addy in my boxes to make it easier for<br/>
half-way interested finders to contact me (rangers etc.)  I do not put my<br/>
phone number or street address in because I don't want to make it that much<br/>
easier for casual vandals to find me.   A group of punks messing around in a<br/>
park that stumble across a box might think it a hoot to come TP a house or<br/>
make crank calls.  Less likely to happen  if they actually have to do a bit<br/>
of research first, ya know?<br/>

I especially don't care to be called "foolish" and my actions--very <br/>
reasonable I might add--as "not very prudent."<br/>
<br/>
Look, someone "in the Security business for 32 years" might be just a <br/>
little too close the issue and security be too large of a part of <br/>
their lives to make rational choices for the rest of us.  Just like <br/>
doctors who want to legislate many issues that affect our lives at <br/>
the expense of choice.  They see the effects every day, yet many in <br/>
the real world might not see them ever.<br/>
<br/>
Do what you want, but don't criticize me for what I do.<br/>
<br/>
I will continue to advocate putting reasonable contact information on <br/>
your box so that landmangers, or bombsquads, can contact you before <br/>
things get out of hand.<br/>
<br/>
I have yet to hear of any problems with this.  Have you?<br/>
<br/>
I'd be willing to bet accidents to and from the box, both on foot and <br/>
in a vehicle, is much more of a danger than putting your contact info <br/>
on a box.<br/>
<br/>
One last issue.  Mr. Jackson says to use the "Contact the Placer" <br/>
function of this site.  Just how are we supposed to do that if it's <br/>
not listed here?  Don't fall into the same trap like those over at <br/>
gc.com in thinking to rely on the site to maintain the whole game.  <br/>
Don't try to advise all boxes should conform to LbNA standards.  The <br/>
standards should be independent of any site.<br/>

See my other post on this.  LbNA is not the end all of listing <br/>
boxes.  Some aren't even listed on the internet.  Kind of hard to use <br/>
the "Contact the Placer" in these cases.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Finding out someone's address from any phone number whether or not <br/>
&gt; it is a cell phone,non pub.home phone is not a very difficult <br/>
&gt; problem. I have not tried to break down an email address but I'm <br/>
<br/>
Well, getting a cell phone number might be easy for a private <br/>
inverstigator, but what about the yahoo that you're really worried <br/>
about?  I doubt it.  Think someone could find the number and talk <br/>
their way into getting someone to meet them?  Only if the person has <br/>
absolutely no sense.  An accidental finder would not have the <br/>
knowledge of boxing and that should alert the box owner to a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Email addresses can be cracked only if the user connects it with <br/>
something else and it's Google-able.  Most online accounts are <br/>
confidiential.  Personal anonymity and security is a big issue on the <br/>
internet.  Even hardcore hackers have a hardtime connecting an email <br/>
address with an actual person.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I think you're more at risk walking to and from your car <br/>
at the mall, than this.<br/>

If you want to place all our your statistics in a letterbox that's <br/>
your business , but advising some one else to do the same may not be <br/>
good advice for another person. Incidentally I thought your comments <br/>

Hi Kathy, <br/>
Don't be put off by the conversations on this list. Sometimes we <br/>
lose sight of the reason to box, but that is why we have moderators <br/>
to keep the conversation as civil as possible. You didn't start <br/>
trouble, in fact you had a great question that provoked some <br/>
interesting responses. Since letterbox clue sheets can be accessed <br/>
by Google and other? non letterboxing search engines, one should <br/>
question their content as well.<br/>
Don<br/>
