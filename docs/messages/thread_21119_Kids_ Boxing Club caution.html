I think that my kids would be excited to have a letterboxing list for<br/>
kids only.<br/>
However I am wondering if I could put in a note of caution here. If<br/>
the name contains something that refers to kids it would attract more<br/>
kids but also it attracts bottom feeder types too. If you do start<br/>
one, could you name it so that it did not have a child like reference?<br/>
 Like "letterboxing for short people", or maybe "midgetboxers"? Just<br/>
something that makes it harder to type in a search under Yahoo for<br/>
kids or children.<br/>
Other than that I think it is a great idea.<br/>

&gt; A little cross posting here, but I was kind of excited about this!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some of the kids from my elementary schools (I travel) have really <br/>
&gt; started to get involved in letterboxing, in and out of school. It <br/>
&gt; started with my personal traveler, which I hid a few different times <br/>
&gt; in the building and let them find during their free time. Then they <br/>
&gt; started wanting to see our logbook and hear stories about where the <br/>
&gt; Highlander and I had been over the weekends. Now they're taking their <br/>
&gt; own recess time to MAKE stamps and scope Atlas Quest, so I'm looking <br/>
&gt; forward to seeing where they end up placing their boxes. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's basically only 1-5 kids at each building, but it's starting to <br/>
&gt; look like an unofficial club (even though most of them don't even <br/>
&gt; know each other). So, I'm unofficially planning a small box hunt for <br/>
&gt; them at the park where 19 boxes from the WNY Gathering were<br/>
&gt; (unofficially means I'll tell kids where we'll be and anyone who <br/>
&gt; shows up and stays with a parent or guardian wiil be there...that way <br/>
&gt; I don't get in trouble for planning a "school function"). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I'm really loving the enthusiasm, so I might make a kids <br/>
&gt; boxing Yahoo group, if I can. If you know any kids who want to post, <br/>
&gt; let me know so I know if this is really worth doing or not.<br/>

&gt; yet, but boy, will he laugh at me) Highlander<br/>
