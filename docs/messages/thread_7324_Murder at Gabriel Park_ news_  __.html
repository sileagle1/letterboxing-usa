                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday, on August 30th, the VERY FIRST THING I did upon <br/>
returning to Portland was to head off to Gabriel Park and replace <br/>
the two missing boxes.  If you saw a strange guy who looked like <br/>
he hadn't taken a shower for several days and was sleeping in <br/>
his car walking around with a letterboxing kit, THAT WAS ME!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, the two missing boxes have been replaced and I <br/>
checked up on the others and can report they're still alive and <br/>
well.  The series is complete for those who want to go back out <br/>
and catch the killer.<br/>
<br/>
None of the clues have changed, but for those who've already <br/>
found the boxes before, the "button" letterbox is in a new location <br/>
since the old one is no longer feasible.  It's in the same area, <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
