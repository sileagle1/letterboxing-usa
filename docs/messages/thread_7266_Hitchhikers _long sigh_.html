i was just wondering how HH were tallied in the little<br/>
count after our names... is it a seperate HH#? but ok.<br/>
my personal thought was that when the person creates<br/>
it and plops it into someone elses box, it is a plant.<br/>
anyone who finds it for the fIrst time, it is a find.<br/>
(if it pops up a second time, go ahead and re-mark it<br/>
in your book with the date and location, but dont<br/>
count it, and consider it a blessing from the lbna<br/>
dieties)<br/>
and as for counting it as a plant when you MOVE it, i<br/>
dont think so. it was meant to move, it is a<br/>
hitchhiker, you have the option of, out of the<br/>
goodness of your heart to give it a lift or spray<br/>
puddle water on it as you speed past. (my thoughts on<br/>
HH's are to move 'em, thats what they are there for,<br/>
and if you put 'em in a box with little traffic, hype<br/>
that box up to others....) <br/>
and i need to go out and plant some more sedentary<br/>
types when the (much needed) rain stops.<br/>
fun boxing to all,<br/>

                    <html><body><p>I agree pretty much with Short Spike. What I do is count a hitchhiker as a find however I find it. If I find it again I don't count it again main reason being I already have that stamp recorded. If I find one in one of my own boxes I count it as a find and I do move them. I take them home for at least a day and check the hitchhikers book against the record on Pete and Wanda's HH Progress page, and report to them any omissions I find.  then usually rehide the HH in another of my boxes but don't ever count moving a HH as a plant. To plant a box, you basically have to make the box. I count the Hitchhikers as a regular find count them once no matter how many times it may show up and never count one as a plant. I also count an event stamp as a find. I know some count them seperately as an event. My records are simple. Plants, Finds, Exchanges. Thats it. Very black and white. Remember this is supposed to be fun. If someone does it a bit different it doesn't really hurt anyone or take away from your adventures. I like the hiking and exploring the most and since discovering letterboxing, it only added another aspect to it. I guess to each his own.....Chuck &amp; Molly P38 F174 X43

in honor of Labor Day, release the "Peter J. McGuire" traveling <br/>
letterbox. This very special box may have a special twist--we'll post <br/>
more about this soon.<br/>
<br/>
Like the Juliette Low HH, who, in the 90th year of Girl Scouting, has <br/>
travelled cross-country, we're hoping Peter McGuire will also travel <br/>
as much in letterboxing as he did in life, beginning on this, the <br/>
120th Labor Day (in the United States).<br/>
