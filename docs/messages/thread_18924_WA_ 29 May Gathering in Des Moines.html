<br/>
WHAT: des Moines wa Mystery letterbox Meet &amp; Seek in May<br/>
<br/>
WHEN: 29 May 04, Saturday<br/>
<br/>
TIME: specific time TBD but plan on formal stuff kicking off around<br/>
3 pm and finishing up after dinner or whenever you'd like to<br/>
leave depending upon when our guest(s) of honor arrive--we'll tweak<br/>
the time after we get more specific travel info from our guest(s)<br/>
<br/>
LOCATION: Des Moines Beach Park (near the playground)--exactly 3.2<br/>
miles West of I-5 Exit 149B!!!<br/>
<br/>
WHO: Anybody who is interested in letterboxing; bring along those<br/>
buddies of yours to whom you're just dying to introduce letterboxing<br/>
<br/>
MYSTERY: ??? This event will culminate with honoring some special<br/>
guest(s) who will visit the Puget Sound region. I'd tell you who it<br/>
is but then that wouldn't be any fun, would it? Kind of like<br/>
knowing where the letterbox is before you read the clues... Just<br/>
know that you'll be very excited to have a certain signature stamp<br/>
or two or more in your logbook after attending this event!!!<br/>
<br/>
FOOD/FUN: Potluck is the best &amp; easiest way to go. Bring enough<br/>
food/drinks/supplies for your group and to share with others.<br/>
Previous events have been a gourmet afficionado's dream!!! You<br/>
won't be hungry after this event!!!<br/>
<br/>
Other details to come as we go along...<br/>
<br/>
If you're itching to plant a letterbox or two, get 'em planted<br/>
before the event. I recommend posting the clues a day or two before<br/>
the 29th so folks can print up the clues before they hit the road--<br/>
then they can spend Sat morning looking for the boxes before the<br/>
formal 'exchange' feeding frenzy begins.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if I'm forgetting any details.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
We can do a letterbox supply donation/exchange/freebie box if folks<br/>
are interested. I've got tons of letterboxing supplies just waiting<br/>
to get into the hands of enthusiastic letterboxers. Let me know if<br/>
you have any ideas for other events.<br/>
<br/>
I reconn'd this site recently and there are quite a few picnic<br/>
tables scattered around this park. Major renovations are underway<br/>
so the running water/bathroom situation isn't the most pleasant<br/>
(doubt they'll be finished by the time this event occurs) but the<br/>
views at the park are still incredible. There are quite a few small<br/>
regional parks not very far from the Beach Park so creating<br/>
interesting and fairly local letterboxes won't be that difficult<br/>
either. The playground is decent and is quite a distance from the<br/>
water so keeping young kids from water's edge won't be as difficult<br/>
as some other venues. The most picnic tables in the park are<br/>
nearest the playground so that would work well for 'self-contained'<br/>
babysitting!<br/>
<br/>
For those staying overnight in the area, nearby<br/>
hotels include a Ramada Limited about a half mile away<br/>
from the park (I actually stayed at it in back in 1997--not 4 stars<br/>
but provides a bed, shower &amp; cable) and there are a bunch of nice<br/>
little restaurants in the area, too--including one of our family<br/>
favorite fish n chips type locales with outstanding blackberry pie<br/>
(Wally's Chowder House).  If folks are coming from a ways and need a <br/>
free place to stay for the night, we also have a few spare rooms in <br/>
our house which is about 25 miles away from the venue but very near <br/>
to MAJOR letterboxing locales (40 boxes within a 5 mile radius I <br/>
think?).  Just let us know sometime before Friday.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there!!! At last count, I had about 35 folks say<br/>
they plan on attending!!!<br/>
