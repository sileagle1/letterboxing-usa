<div>Our,  "adult" Sunday School (my wife Valerie 
and I) consists of spending 45 minutes, alone, over coffee and tea at the 
village coffee shop while the kids are in real Sunday school. Yesterday some 
friends joined us. They have 4 kids ranging from K to 7th. I was telling Norb 
about my geocaches, and he, an engineer also and GPS geek, said maybe he could 
take the family to find one. I then told him about "Locust Shade" and "A Few 
Good Men", and how following letterbox instructions would be more suited for the 
kids then going to a GPS way point.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Tonight I got home in time to start on the lawn, 
and as I pulled the mower out of the garage, Thomas (K) and Stef (4) came up on 
their bikes. Thomas was all excited and said "We went on "YOUR" hike and saw a 
bone..." I didn't quite catch what he ment, but 5 minutes later Valerie brings 
me the phone and it's Gail. Thomas's mother. Gail also excited, proceeds to tell 
how much fun the whole family had Sunday afternoon hiking the two miles and 
looking for Locust Shade #1 and #2... They are hooked. The bone Thomas saw was 
laying along the creek about 20 feet from the second box. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So they have big plans on carving their own stamp 
and are planning on looking for some more boxes...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Like I said.... It makes the sweat and effort 
worth it..</div>
