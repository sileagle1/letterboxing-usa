                    <div class="plaintext-content">Gosh, I didn't expect this to be such a hot topic.  Thinking about it<br/>
I can see the point that maybe collecting stamps from an event that I<br/>
did not attend would be unkosher. <br/>
That said, I think that I would like to point out how this came about.<br/>
<br/>
My family and I have put together 6 boxes and 2 hitchhikers for this<br/>
event. These boxes are not basic boxes either. Inside each box is an<br/>
elaborate handcarved stamp, a handmade logbook with stamped token<br/>
attatched, and last but not least a  little coordinating first finder<br/>
certificate also with a shrinky dink token attatched. If Martha<br/>
Stewart was a letterboxer this is probably what her boxes would look<br/>
like.  <br/>
I was excited to do this and we have spent many pleasurable hours<br/>
doing so but at some point it did occur to me that I would like to see<br/>
what other people are doing too.  I can't make it to Connecticut, I am<br/>
in Utah and we have a total of perhaps 30 boxes statewide. This is a<br/>
different letterboxing world here. <br/>
Ultimately, I think that if someone makes a box for an event that<br/>
having someone collect stamps for them as a courtesy is OK. I don't<br/>
think that I would consider them found, [since I didn't ], but I get a<br/>
lot of pleasure out of carving and I enjoy seeing what other people do<br/>
and I think that people who live in states that have tons of<br/>
letterboxes have different issues than those of us who live in a "dry<br/>
state" which is more ways than one here in Utah!<br/>
I think that it would be great to discuss this situation on the list<br/>
but maybe we could keep the insults down and try a little harder to<br/>
listen to points of view that might be different than our current way<br/>
of seeing things,<br/>
I like to think that Letterboxing is a work in progress.............<br/>
That said I will be signing off as Martha Stewart, just don't try to<br/>
throw me in jail, I didn't do it!<br/>

Maybe you could put your photo in, and show some of the stamps you donated to the event.  Just a thought from a lurker.<br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">I understand what you are saying in many ways, but still would have <br/>
to disagree with the practice.<br/>
<br/>
First, it sounds like you put a lot of work into your boxes -- <br/>
carving a stamp, making a log book, etc.  These are the types of <br/>
boxes we all like to find, the type of boxes that rate pretty high <br/>
up on Poison Ivy's box rating system (see post 42134).  However... <br/>
many people would consider this to be a standard box and put this <br/>
type of effort into everything they put out and do not feel there is <br/>
any type of reward warranted, other than the personal satisfaction <br/>
of having planted a really well-crafted box.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I can sympathize with your plight of living in a <br/>
letterboxing void.  Many people who do not live on the coasts were <br/>
at one time in that situation -- only a handful of boxes, no <br/>
organized gatherings nearby, etc.  But there are two ways to look at <br/>
that -- every problem is an opportunity.  Being in an area <br/>
where 'boxes are sparse is a fantastic oppotunity for you to build <br/>
something, particularly if you put the time and effort into all of <br/>
the boxes you plant as you did these for the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Third, think about it from the perspective of the people who are <br/>
attending the event.  Based on the description of your 'boxing area, <br/>
I would daresay you have not ever been to a letterbox gathering.  <br/>
The first few hours while everyone is exchanging stamps and stamping <br/>
the event stamps into their books are crazy -- books and stamps <br/>
flying everywhere, way too many books to stamp just of people who <br/>
are actually there.  Once out on the trail, at gatherings where <br/>
there are many attendees, it is not unusual to stand in line behind <br/>
other 'boxers out in the woods, waiting your turn to stamp into a <br/>
box.  Now, let's say that several of the attendees have with them <br/>
two log books instead of just one, having given a lift to a book <br/>
whose owner could not attend the gathering.  Think how much extra <br/>
stamping and time that would entail.  Not really fair to folks who <br/>
did make the journey to the event, however near or far they live.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, it just doesn't fit the philosophy of letterboxing.  It is <br/>
not simply about collecting stamps, it is about the total experience <br/>
involved with collecting and crafting the stamps.  You have to be <br/>
able to accept that there is not going to be an immediate reward for <br/>
everything you do, that there are going to be events you can only <br/>
participate in vicariously as attendees share stories on the list <br/>
after the event, that there are box locations you will never get to <br/>
and that not every box is meant for or available to every person.  <br/>
Although that may seem frustrating at first glance, in the long run, <br/>
it only makes the scores that much sweeter.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note...  sometimes when an event has many boxes solicited <br/>
from 'boxers across the country, the event host will put together a <br/>
series of event box stamps on postcards that get sent to <br/>
contributors.  I have a few of these and they are true treasures.  <br/>
It is really appreciated and a wonderful gesture on the part of the <br/>
host, but it is a lot of work and certainly not expected.  I have <br/>
also seen where the host will stamp all of the event boxes into the <br/>
logs of the other events boxes prior to planting them at the event.  <br/>
That way when you get your box back after the event, the log book <br/>
contains stamps of the other event boxes as well as the attendees <br/>
who found the box.  Again it is a lot of work and not expected, just <br/>
one of those nice little perks.  <br/>
