There's lots of helpful information on the newboxers list, as well as on the 2 major sites, Atlas Quest and Letterboxing North America.<br/>

Here's a list of letterboxes listed on Atlas Quest for the Austin, Texas area (56 letterboxes):<br/>

Remember to put the box back where you found it and cover it up well so that it won't be visible to non-boxers.  <br/>
