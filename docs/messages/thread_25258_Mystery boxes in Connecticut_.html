Looking to plant some boxes in CT, specifically at the Goodspeed<br/>
Airport in East Haddam and NEAM in Windsor Locks.<br/>
Have looked on both AQ and LBNA and see no listed boxes. Double<br/>
checking to make sure there are no Mystery boxes that I am not aware<br/>
of, don't want to go poaching through other folks back yards!<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Although the East Haddam airport looks very tempting with all that beautiful waterfront, it is after all an airport in the post-September 11th era. You won't see patrolling uniforms or bomb sniffing dogs, but it is well fenced and is private property. Perhaps something close by might be safer for your finders?<br/>
<br/>
The New England Air Museum is completely surrounded by airport, and that side of it is National Guard territory, so again I would suggest caution in planting.<br/>
<br/>
The more I think about planting hidden boxes at airports, the more I worry about both planters and finders.<br/>
<br/>
As for outing local mystery boxes in a public forum, my lips are sealed ;)<br/>
