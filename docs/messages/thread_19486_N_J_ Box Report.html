a family with kids were the last people to find them. The boxes were not <br/>
hidden very well. 3 boxes were left right out in the open on top of where <br/>
the hiding places are supposed to be. Box 3 appears to be missing.<br/>
This series has been out there for a little over a year, and we were <br/>
surprised at how few people stamped into them. (Even Pete and Wanda haven't <br/>
been there yet)!!!!! I highly recommend this series, because it is a nice <br/>
walk in a really nice park.<br/>
I know this has been brought up before, but...... Parents, please make sure <br/>
that if your children rehide the boxes that you check to make sure that the <br/>
boxes are rehidden properly. I bet that most of the boxes that go missing <br/>
are because they are not hidden well enough.<br/>

to be about 4 or 5 years ago in our pre-letterboxing days! :-) <br/>
Seems like ages since we've been down to NJ or PA - maybe this fall, <br/>
if we ever run out of boxes to do here in New England!!!<br/>
