<div>Went to Cape Cod with the hope of finding a couple more 
letterboxes. Started at Four Ponds in Pocasset with Ginger's lovely but cryptic 
poem (Ginger, you <em>know</em> we love you). It started to rain about 15 mins 
before we arrived but, undaunted, we set off. The hike to the box is beautiful 
and despite Ginger's clues we succeeded in finding the box. The real reward is 
the beautiful hand carved stamp that awaits you--we were impressed! The next day 
found us in Wellfleet planting a box in honor of Guglielmo Marconi (clues to be 
posted soon) and then off to find the Three Sisters. Unfortunately we had 
downloaded the old set of clues and did not find the letterbox because it's 
location is changed. Then it was off to Orleans to look for Two for the Road. 
Well, we'll be returning to give that one another try too. Still, letterboxing 
brings us to new locations and, because we don't always succeed in finding 
the box, makes it all the sweeter when we do. Thanks to all 
involved.</div>

You won't find "Two for the Road" in Orleans.  They<br/>
were uprooted during trail reconstruction, but are now<br/>
on the road as a hitchhiker.<br/>

<br/>
We found <br/>
Heron's Haven - Yarmouthport <br/>
A Very Gorey Box - Yarmouthport<br/>
Reunion - Harwich<br/>
Chatham Light - Chatham (more on this box at end of message and I will post on another email as well for those who may not have opened this subject line) <br/>
3 Sisters Light- Eastham (GREAT PICNIC SPOT)<br/>
Cape Nauset - Eastham - We even got to walk into the light!!<br/>
<br/>
At Chatham Light there was extra stamp. It was hand carved of a broken down car. There was no log book but it was in its own bag. Could anyone tell if this is a HH or someone's lost stamp??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who added to the weekend with there boxes! They were all great. I wish we had more time to do more. <br/>
