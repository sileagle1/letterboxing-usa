     I can't wait to see what develops either! I have two boxes ready to go, <br/>
but I keep putting off placing them because I want that 'just the right <br/>
spot' feeling for them. However, I guarantee that my first box will be <br/>
planted this weekend. (Hear that Redd?). By the way, what is boxing <br/>
etiquette as far as placing boxes in areas such as a state park where a day <br/>
use fee may be charged for entrance, or perhaps a cemetary. Not that I am <br/>
actually planning on that, but I thought that I should get that straightened <br/>
out up front before I do something foolish. Please, any advice that anyone <br/>
could give me would be greatly appreciated. And Jay, thank you for your kind <br/>
Comments concerning my site. Happy boxing!<br/>

<br/>
I'm looking forward to seeking your letterboxes.  It's great to see another Omahan<br/>
getting into the game.  It's been lonely here all by myself.  :)  Now I'll finally<br/>
get a chance to seek one.<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean about finding just the right spot.  I've had a special stamp<br/>
and log book just waiting to go, and I've looked at several spots at which I<br/>
considered placing it, but still haven't found the right place.<br/>
<br/>
Concerning park fees, I say that as long as you disclose the fee in your letterbox<br/>
description, it's allright.  This summer, my family and I happened to visit many<br/>
state parks to just to  seek a Geocache.  The Geocache was the reason we visited,<br/>
and paying $2.50 for park entry was money well spent.  I think this year we'll buy<br/>
a yearly pass.  We probably could have bought two of them this year with all the<br/>
single-day fees we paid!<br/>
<br/>
I would think most cemetaries would be private property, and as such, off-limits for<br/>
letterboxing and geocaching.  I am not sure about older, historic cemetaries.<br/>
Perhaps more experienced letterboxers can help you out on this one.  Personally, I<br/>
don't think most people would like the idea of folks making a game out of their family plot.<br/>
:-O<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Concerning park fees, I say that as long as you disclose the fee in your <br/>
&gt; letterbox description, it's allright. <br/>
<br/>
I think park fees are fine, and do not need to be disclosed in the clue.<br/>
Part of solving a problem is determining all the of resources you need to<br/>
solve it, and deciding if you want to press on.  On the other hand, there<br/>
is certainly nothing wrong with disclosing fees (or any other information)<br/>
in the clues, except that these fees can tend to change with both time <br/>
and the season of the year (at least that is the case in my neighborhood<br/>
where some parks become free off-season, for example).<br/>
<br/>
My advice, FWIW, is to put the box where you want regardless of park fees, <br/>
and don't mention them in the clue.  People who go to parks know how these<br/>
things work.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I am not sure about older, historic cemetaries.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps more experienced letterboxers can help you out on this one. <br/>
<br/>
A surprising number of the Valley Quest boxes had you traipsing thru<br/>
cemeteries.  I thought this was a bit odd but it all depends what you<br/>
are comfortable with.  Again, it is the choice of the hunter to press<br/>
on once they get the facts.<br/>
<br/>
On this regard, I think who owns or manages the land is a much more<br/>
important factor than whether or not a cemetery (or anything else)<br/>
happens to be on it.  If in doubt, ask the owner or manager.  Cemeteries<br/>
are not off limit to letterboxing because they are cemeteries.  Use<br/>
taste, common sense, and follow the rules where ever you conduct your<br/>
self.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Randy<br/>
