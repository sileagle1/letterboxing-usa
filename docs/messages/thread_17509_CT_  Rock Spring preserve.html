guide to Nature Conservancy Preserves).  If anyone would like more <br/>
specific info. about this book, I will be glad to provide it of <br/>
course.<br/>
  Rock Spring is an incredible place to hike.  The diversity of <br/>
flora, fauna,  terrain is incredible. The pine woods area referred to <br/>
is a small pine plantation approx. 50 years old. Most of the trees <br/>
are red pines.At the northern end, there are some white pines. <br/>
     A magical place to hike, if I may say so.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the info.  I have borrowed that book from the library.   In the book I couldn't find an explanation for that part of the trail.  It may have mentioned a "pine forest" or something but that little section was so memorable to me that I was hungry for more details.  <br/>
<br/>
I'll see what else I can find out and see if I can create an adequate stamp and place it in the vicinity.<br/>
