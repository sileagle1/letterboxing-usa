and near lands gathered last Saturday to celebrate the revered image and <br/>
repent their wandering ways. Several arrived with gifts for those less <br/>
fortunate and many needy recipients will benefit from their generosity.  To <br/>
donate was divine.  We have all been redeemed and have gone our own ways.<br/>
<br/>
Before, I also depart for distant shores I want to thank all who came and <br/>
especially, my faithful cohort, Ms Alafair, for all her effort.<br/>
<br/>
Until next year, keep seeking and you shall find,<br/>
Tom Noone<br/>
