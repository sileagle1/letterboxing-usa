                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, Folks! Der Mad Stamper here. I just wanted to bring everyone up-<br/>
to-date about our progress with the "We Live and Breathe <br/>
Letterboxing" event.<br/>
<br/>
My friends and I have been visiting Camp Adams almost every weekend <br/>
for the past month or so, mapping the trails and scoping out hiding <br/>
places, and I must say that I'm happier than ever about choosing this <br/>
place to host our gathering!<br/>
<br/>
The camp is 210 acres of dense forest with trails zigzagging and <br/>
looping all over the place and plenty of breathtaking scenery. My <br/>
personal criteria for choosing the location for this event was that <br/>
we needed a place large enough so that people wouldn't be constantly <br/>
bumping into one another on the trails, but not so expansive that we <br/>
would have to call in helicopters to make airlift rescues of lost <br/>
hikers. I'm starting to realize that we succeeded in finding the <br/>
ideal sweet spot between those two extremes!<br/>
<br/>
There's a 420-foot change of elevation from one side of camp to the <br/>
other. I realize that might not impress the hardcore hikers out <br/>
there, but I can assure you that once you've climbed that ridge a <br/>
half dozen times or so, you'll feel like you've gotten quite a <br/>
workout! A couple of weeks ago, I found my way up to a lookout they <br/>
call "Eagle's Nest." I've gotta tell ya, the view from that spot <br/>
alone is worth the trip!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you're not up to ridge climbing, there'll be scores of <br/>
letterboxes in the lower areas of the camp. There's gonna be <br/>
something for everyone at this event, including those who long to <br/>
hike out into the woods and feel like they are alone in the universe, <br/>
as well as those who just want to socialize and get to know lots of <br/>
fellow letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Several people have contacted us to ask when we'll be publishing a <br/>
list of registered attendees. I know everyone is anxious to start <br/>
studying up for all those personal traveler stamps! We're currently <br/>
going through the list to make sure we have permission from everyone <br/>
to publish their names. As soon as we have that all ironed out, we <br/>
will put the list on our official event website at <br/>
www.WeLiveAndBreathe.com. If you haven't visited that site recently, <br/>
I recommend that you check it out and keep coming back. We're posting <br/>
new info there all the time!<br/>
<br/>
You've probably noticed other posts indicating that we're accepting <br/>
submissions for boxes to be hidden in the camp, and searching for <br/>
people to share their talents during the campfire circle and the <br/>
Saturday night "Letterboxer's Ball." We're also looking for people <br/>
who want to donate door prizes, so there are lots of opportunities to <br/>
be a part of this grand celebration... even if you can't make it to <br/>
Oregon in September.<br/>
<br/>
But if you CAN work it into your schedule, I promise this will be an <br/>
event to remember a fabulous festival to commemorate ten years of <br/>
American letterboxing history. Last time I looked, there were only <br/>
about 100 reservations left for this event, so don't wait until it's <br/>
too late! Register as soon as possible at www.WeLiveAndBreathe.com.<br/>
<br/>
See you in September!<br/>
