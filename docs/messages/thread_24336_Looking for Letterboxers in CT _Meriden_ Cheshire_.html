&gt; Jesse, frankly many of us DON'T want Letterboxing spread around in <br/>
&gt; this way, so please don't add another article that <br/>
&gt; attracts "infatuation" to the hobby.  The majority of these folks who <br/>
&gt; read the articles don't bother to *really* learn about Letterboxing <br/>
&gt; before jumping in to go on this exciting-sounding "treasure hunt", <br/>
&gt; often jeopardizing our 'boxes.  It is a game of stealth, and they <br/>
&gt; usually just don't get that...<br/>
&gt; Please reconsider, and if you like the hobby so much, just introduce <br/>
&gt; it to a few of your friends who you know will also enjoy and respect <br/>
&gt; it.  Word of mouth is the only way Letterboxing should be "spread" in <br/>
&gt; my opinion!<br/>

What a conceded, stuck up snob you are.<br/>
<br/>
Basically your whole post comes down to you not wanting "those kinds of <br/>
people."  At least that is how I read it.  But of course what am I to <br/>
expect from someone who sends poster boards to gatherings telling people <br/>
how they should play the game?<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand you folks complain that articles are written without <br/>
ever getting information from letterboxers themselves, but on the other <br/>
hand, when asked, you berate the reporter and tell them they should not <br/>
write the article, that it will attract the wrong type of people.  Well, <br/>
you are going to have some give and take in anything, and I think these <br/>
articles have attracted lots of the right kinds of people too.<br/>
