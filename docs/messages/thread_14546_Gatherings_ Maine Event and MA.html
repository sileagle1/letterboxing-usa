plenty of boxes. Otherwise some are planted for the day - event stamps and new <br/>
stamps that are published after the meet. Most importantly are the stories from <br/>
the trail that we share and the wonderful friendships that are made.<br/>

See you there!!<br/>

Okay let's see... um, yes, yes and yes....sometimes there are carving <br/>
contests or secret travelers that you must figure out how to get from their <br/>
respective carriers. Sometimes there are multiple event stamps or event-only boxes. <br/>
Usually it is a crazy mad-cap exchanging extravaganza (just imagine sixty + <br/>
people trying to make sure they have exchanged with everyone else!!! - remember the <br/>
January Moose Hill gathering? Phew!)<br/>
<br/>
And of course I'm sure everyone is open to starting new traditions too :-)<br/>
CSCM and I will be sporting our self-created LBNA t-shirts and bring the LBNA <br/>
banner we made for a festival we attended.<br/>
<br/>
See you there!<br/>
