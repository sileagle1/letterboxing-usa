I have no idea, but I recently got an email re: one of my very first <br/>
attempts at placing boxes in Denver (where there are no others that <br/>
I know of...for some unknown reeason)...<br/>
<br/>
which said (per my request to comment on my craft)...."I would never <br/>
THINK (not my caps) of ....effectively...<br/>
<br/>
"poking around under rocks (in CO) under 9000 feet" to look for your <br/>
box"<br/>
<br/>
..which seemed (to me) to say, glad you've planted boxes in <br/>
Denver....you pioneer....but<br/>
<br/>
I'd NEVER dream of looking for your efforts...<br/>
<br/>
I found out AFTER a reply, the intention of the comment was meant to <br/>
refer to SNAKES! when out dog walking....apparently they are BAD <br/>
news!<br/>
<br/>
Well.....now I know! but I still don't get it...cause in 7 years <br/>
I've never met a snake...of the NON human variety :-) at ANY <br/>
eleveation!<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for sounding rude to that respondant in my own reply to <br/>
that email...but it sure felt like a "diss" on my boxes! but I don't <br/>
have a doggie friend...nor a snake, so I did not know...<br/>
<br/>
The things we learn, eh?<br/>
