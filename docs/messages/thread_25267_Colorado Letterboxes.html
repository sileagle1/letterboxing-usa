Hi to all in LB land, Colorado is such a big state , please help me decide which part of the state we should spend the most time at. We will be camping out in the wild if we find a good place. Are there any letterboxes along streams that may have gold that we can pan for. Its sounds like a fun thing to do for the few days we will be there.

I don't live in Colorado but I have heard that some good places to pan for gold (and river raft) are along the Arkansas River near Leadville, and along La Plata Creek near Durango.  I guess you could look at Letterbox clues in those areas.  Good luck, and if you find any gold maybe you can donate a little to LBNA :)<br/>
