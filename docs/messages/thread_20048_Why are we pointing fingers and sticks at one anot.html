planted very recently.  I was the first finder.  The clues indicated the<br/>
box was hidden behind some bark.  When I spotted it, the bark was not<br/>
there.  I pulled it out and moved offsite to stamp up.  I found lots of<br/>
sticks and bark to reconceal it.  As I approached the tree, a small<br/>
chipmunk peered out of another hollow in tree.  Being a bit uneasy, I used<br/>
a long stick and tapped on the tree hoping to distract the little guy.  I<br/>
don't know where he went, but I put that LB in quickly and further into<br/>
its hiding place.  Did I destroy his home?  Is letterboxing immune to<br/>
natural selection?  I accept that sometimes, it just not pay to fool with<br/>
Mother Nature.<br/>
