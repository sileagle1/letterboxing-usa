Ct. Thanks Irishtinker for the gentle reminder. We were surprised to see
two boxes in Goodwin last week not only left out but not closed up. Perhaps
this reminder would be well to post now and again. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know what you mean about the rehiding job leaving the boxes in <br/>
jeopardy.  In my experience, it's not the box that shows but the <br/>
attempts at camoflaging.  Sometimes you haven't even gotten to the <br/>
last clue and you can spot the pile of neatly laid sticks and bark <br/>
and rocks all in a row. I suppose the finders do the best they can <br/>
with what's at hand and they probably try to rehide it the way they <br/>
found it.  But we can do better than that!  If it looks phony, look <br/>
around for a bigger piece of bark or whatever to conceal the box. You <br/>
don't have to cover it exactly like you found it - you can do a <br/>
better job at it.   <br/>
