                    <div class="plaintext-content">WOW, Mitch the logo-in-progress looks GREAT! I like the yellow letter <br/>
borders a lot, and also the orange "Greetings from."  I can't wait to <br/>
see what other images are added inside the letters.  Here are some <br/>
suggestions:  a cornfield, or a close-up of ripe ears of corn.  (Or, if <br/>
you can find it on the web someplace, maybe I'll look too) the DeKalb <br/>
corn sign (which you see all over Illinois, where I grew up).  It's an <br/>
ear of corn with wings.<br/>
<br/>
How about Niagara Falls?  A typical white New England church with a tall <br/>
white spire, nestled in the hills?  A crocodile?  New Orleans during <br/>
Mardi Gras?  A cypress swamp?  A red dirt road?  The Painted Desert?  A <br/>
turkey? A bison? A bald eagle?  Duke Ellington?  Janis Joplin?  A Texas <br/>
oil field?  The Picasso sculpture in downtown Chicago?  Or a Calder <br/>
sculpture?  The Vietnam Memorial? The Monkees?<br/>
Dick van Dyke?  Bob Dylan?  A log cabin?  A giant bottle of ketchup? <br/>
(there's one in a tiny southern Illinois town that I saw once, passing <br/>
through).  Wall Drugs?<br/>
<br/>
OK, OK, I'll stop now. Thanks for your hard work and creative response <br/>
to our input.  I love this group!<br/>

<br/>
I was simply blown away by your last posting.......<br/>
<br/>
I never thought I'd be reading poetry on the L-USA listserver, but truth<br/>
confounds wisdom everytime !<br/>
<br/>
Just a wonderful personal poem of America .. I just close my eyes and see<br/>
it as a series of images with the matched sounds crashing into one<br/>
another..from the singing in church to the Mardi Gras din, to Duke<br/>
Ellington (and why not also the other "Duke" whose golden statue smiles<br/>
benignly at the travellers at San Diego Airport ) to Chicago traffic,  to<br/>
Dylan singing to ..well even a Ketchup advert !..it's wonderful imagery....<br/>
<br/>
Wonderful stuff ( and I'm a Brit !)<br/>
<br/>
These all would make ideal boxes for a "Nationwide Millennium Tribute to<br/>
America" Letterbox set !<br/>
