<br/>
I was informed by a LBer that it appeared the One-Armed Bandit box <br/>
that was originally planted by Amada from Seattle and replaced by <br/>
earlier this year has officially gone missing again.  My friend went <br/>
out and checked the site yesterday and saw that the box and the <br/>
nearby geocaching clue were both gone.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a sign that the spot is not such a good one afterall, <br/>
maybe it got too much traffic over the years. I'm pulling the clues <br/>
off the site.  If I decide to replace the box it will be in a <br/>
completely new area.<br/>
<br/>
This is the third box in So. Nevada to go missing this month.  A real <br/>
shame. Boo hiss.<br/>
