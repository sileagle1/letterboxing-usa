These are quick and easy letterboxes with moderately difficult clues.<br/>

Crocker Mystery<br/>
<br/>
	Go to the place named for the mountain and the greensward.<br/>
	Crocker has been waiting there for you for hundreds of years.<br/>
	She's Wearing a Dead Bird on Her Head!<br/>
<br/>
Before beginning, pick up a trail map.<br/>
Sit down and visit with Crocker, and see how many Ganoderma <br/>
applanatum s/he has collected.<br/>
Due North from your seat, find the box low and in the inside corner.<br/>

<br/>
    I am proud to say that I was the first one to find your letterboxes<br/>
today (such a beauty) with a friend.  She had forgotten her stamp.<br/>
<br/>
    It was fun to figure out the clues that you had provided at the<br/>
gathering.   We liked both of your stamps, and your clues were very clever!<br/>
