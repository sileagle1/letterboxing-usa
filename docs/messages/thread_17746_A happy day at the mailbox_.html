One was the Beating A Dead Horse postal box which I had been<br/>
expecting and the other was the Days of Her Life postal box (thanks<br/>
Scoutdogs!). Even better - they each had a hitchhiker inside!<br/>
Happy, happy, happy dance!!! We'll move them along ASAP. If any of<br/>
you are on the 'Days' list, you may find a surprise in the mailbox<br/>
one day soon. Stay warm and keep carving!<br/>
