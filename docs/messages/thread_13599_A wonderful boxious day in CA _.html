                    <div class="plaintext-content">Finally had the opportunity to spend 1 1/2 days in the San Luis Obispo<br/>
area and came away with 22 boxes for my efforts almost doubling my pre-visit <br/>
stash!! As a bonus, I was able to spend time with my aunt I hadn't seen in <br/>
many years who, of course, was able to help me with many of the locations of the <br/>
boxes. She was with me every step of the way too! My wonderful cousin and her <br/>
outdoorsey boyfriend caught on and insisted on going out until almost dark to <br/>
find 4 boxes with me and I am happy to say, THEY ARE HOOKED on this great <br/>
hobby! So don't be surprised if a whole lot more boxes start showing up in the <br/>
Letterboxing Capital of California!!<br/>
<br/>
Here are the boxes I successfully found:<br/>
Gandalf the Wizard, Cambria-A Wizard indeed!!<br/>
Citizen Kane Series, San Simeon-2 out of 3 as there were picnickers too close <br/>
for comfort.<br/>
Sweet Springs, Los Osos-almost gave up as the trunk has so very many nooks <br/>
and crannies!<br/>
Shady Coyote--Such a beautiful bluff trail--full of wildflowers! Lest you're <br/>
tempted to give up on this nearly impossible find, DO NOT! It's THERE!!<br/>
Alaskan Series in San Luis Obispo--Alive and well (one only 1 block from my <br/>
aunt's house!<br/>
Mill Street,SLO--Beautiful bi-colored stamp! Placer includes 2 colors of ink <br/>
in the box!<br/>
Burial Mounds of Edoras, SLO--You'll swear it's not there but such a clever <br/>
hiding place!<br/>
Night and Day SLO==amazing stamp!<br/>
Pandora's Native American Bear--Cute and cuddly<br/>
Night Train--Woooooo--Woooooo<br/>
Mr. Chong's Candy--So Sweet!<br/>
Smaug's Mountain--Baby slugs abound in this wet box. Helped it out as best I <br/>
could though<br/>
The Bookstore Box--as easy and fulfilling as the Walking Tour box was <br/>
difficult!<br/>
Walking Tour Box--wins the prize for cleverness. The most fulfilling find <br/>
EVER!! You really WORK for this one up to the very end!!<br/>
Onion Tree--had to go back 4 times as there was a wedding in progress<br/>
Sunflash the Mace--also only a couple of blocks from my Aunt's house!<br/>
Los Osos Oaks Series--Without a doubt, THE most hauntingly beautiful <br/>
place you'll ever want to play with fairies and climb trees. Don't miss this <br/>
series of boxes even if one is supposedly missing. . .<br/>
<br/>
Also found 3 of the 4 Chaos stamps Pandora set loose. I suspect the fourth <br/>
was in a box we spent many hours trying to figure out and came away frustrated. <br/>
The RUN FOR THE BORDER box, aka Taco Bell box was just too hard for us. But, <br/>
we had a lot of TBell food that day! <br/>
Another failure was the Moonstone Beach box which seems to have gone missing. <br/>
Rocks were there but I think the squirrels got it.<br/>
<br/>
I also managed to place a new box near Santa Cruz. Will write clues soon!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great to have you boxing in the neighborhood. Next time, a favor? Let <br/>
us know where you are and we can all meet up to do some exchanges.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the rave reviews. Some of those are mine and you will love <br/>
some of those you still have not found here. Hopefully you will be <br/>
back for an October get together. Instead of "Christmas in July," can <br/>
we have "Boxing Day in October?" <br/>
<br/>
JugglerMouse is now going to be planting two Redwall stamps a month. <br/>
I guarantee that they will all be as wonderful as the first two. <br/>
Okay, anything with a badger has to be beautiful, but... BTW, that <br/>
Mill St. Camphor Tree stamp was Sadie from Nebraska's second box. <br/>
Ain't she talented?! JugglerMouse insisted on leaving the ink in <br/>
there. I am honored to be around such ladies.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you had a chance to be entertained by the keeper of Gandalf. He <br/>
is a gem. Stole our hearts away.<br/>
<br/>
Er, about the Chaos pieces, Pandy who is leaving the state tomorrow, <br/>
just gave me the fourth piece. She mistakenly forgot to plant it. If <br/>
you come back here and let me know (so I can get an exchange from <br/>
you), I might be tempted to tell you where I planted it.  Honestly, <br/>
JugglerMouse and I worked our buns off looking for it before Pandy <br/>
got back. Chaotic, you betcha!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, if your local relatives are into 'boxing, please have them give <br/>
us a holler. We would love to talk with them and exchange tidbits and <br/>
stamps. Any friend of Ole Blue, is a friend of ours.<br/>
<br/>
Moonstone Castle was a hard find. It was not where we expected it. It <br/>
still might be there.<br/>
<br/>
You did find Sweet Springs? Wow, I thought that had gone missing. <br/>
Cool.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Pandy also left me about eight stamps in boxes to plant. Next <br/>
time you are around, you will have a grunch more to find. But twenty <br/>
two boxes in two days is hauling it. Congrats!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the lengthy email! I'll try to respond to your comments:<br/>
1) I don't have my cousin's email address but she said she'd be checking the <br/>
talk list so I hope she'll be signing in and we can get it that way. (It's <br/>
probably kim011 @. . . something, I know not what)<br/>
2) You think the Moonstone box is still there? But I saw the pile of rocks at <br/>
the acute angle with no box!<br/>
3) I had the pleasure of watching the Wizard 'perform' for a couple of groups <br/>
in the store while I shopped. Quite a guy!<br/>
4)Sadie from Nebraska is INDEED talented. I loved the 2 inks-in-the-box idea!<br/>
5)About the 4th Pandy Chaos stamp. . . I would love to have had it but feel <br/>
better that at least it wasn't in the Run for the Border box that I failed to <br/>
decipher! Have you gotten that box?<br/>
6)Sweet Springs was a tough one. I poked around for at least 10 minutes and <br/>
gave up. Circled the stump, dove in again and it was in a 'nook' I hadn't <br/>
disturbed. VERY well camouflaged!<br/>
7) Since it's been 11 years since I've been to SLO, I doubt I'll be going <br/>
back any time soon but my cousin will take my place and I can 'box' vicariously <br/>
though her. She and her boyfriend (who I call Mushroom Man--which I suggested <br/>
be his nickname) will be sure to entertain you and the other boxers in SLO.<br/>
8) Aries with a Pisces Moon? Tough one! But your ascendant is on my midheaven <br/>
so I guess we'd get along fine! I have a Cancer Moon, Virgo midheaven. You <br/>
heard Sagittarius' were goofs? I'm an astrologer and I'd never heard that!<br/>
<br/>
BTW--Old Blue wasn't with me on this trip and I missed him terribly. Duty <br/>
called at home and this was my only chance to travel so. . . I shared my stamps <br/>
with him though.<br/>
