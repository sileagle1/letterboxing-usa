                    <html><body><div>Placed by: JustBeth, Aaron and Max</div> <div>Name: Honest Abe Letterbox</div> <div>Location: Middlebury, CT   New Haven County</div> <div>2/12/03<br/><br/>It is at beautiful Hop Brook Lake, you might want to check out the website during the spring and summer to see what this park offers. This is a wonderful place to spend a day with the family or just alone. Swimming and fishing are allowed. This park also happens to be pooch friendly, so long as they are leashed. I have learned that there is now a fee to enter the park from Memorial Day to Labor Day (1.00 for each person on foot or 3.00 per car). So keep that in mind when you go. However this box is accessible quite easily by foot even when the park is closed. <br/><br/><br/>Hop Brook Lake<br/>Route 63 / Straits Turnpike<br/>Middlebury, CT<br/>This is a quick easy hike for all.</div> <p> </p> <p>This is the first in our United States Presidents series (I know I went out of order). We had hoped this would not only be a fun but an educational series too.</p> <p>Abraham Lincoln</p> <p>16th President 1861-1865</p> <p>Republican</p> <p>Vice Presidents - Hannibal Hamlin                                                                </p> <p>                        Andrew Johnson</p> <p>Born: February 12, 1809   near Hodgenville, Kentucky</p> <p>Occupation: Lawyer</p> <p>Married: Mary Todd</p> <p>Died: April 15, 1865  in Washington, D.C.</p> <p>Early Years: Lincoln received no more than a year of schooling, but read every book he could borrow and became a master of the English language. He studied law in his spare time and passed the bar in two years.</p> <p>His Presidency: Lincoln's election resulted in the secession of the southern states from the Union and the start of the Civil War which brought an end to slavery. His first goal had been to preserve the Union. It then became to restore peace. Shortly after beginning his second term in office, he was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth while attending a play at Ford's Theater. He is considered by many to be our nation's greatest president.</p> <p>Did you know? Lincoln was the tallest president at six feet four inches, and the first to wear a beard.</p> <p align="left">Depending on whether or not the park is open; either park at the top lot and walk down or begin at the first parking lot next to the guard booth.</p> <p align="left">Follow the Wetland Trail to the south, the trail is blazed with blue. It is a short walk to the lookout deck. Mr. Lincoln is waiting for you on the right side of the deck under the very first board. Just reach underneath and claim your prize.<br/></p></body></html>

Thanks for your great comments about my stamps, they were my first <br/>
real attempt at carving. I'm excited you trudged through the snow for <br/>
them. In addition to Washington, and Adams; I have Thomas Jefferson <br/>
all ready to find a resting place. We have also placed a box called <br/>
Aarons Birthday Box, well for my sons birthday. The current stamp <br/>
will be retired on February 7, 2004, when it will be replaced by the <br/>
12 year commemorative stamp......oh gosh I think I'm addicted!!<br/>
I hope to have the clues posted this week on all these boxes.(If I <br/>
letterbox instead of studying that is!)<br/>
