                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have several orphans in a variety of states  folks have kindly <br/>
fixed them for me on visits with a new bag or ink. I occasionaly <br/>
visit those places every few years and hope to do a checkup then. I <br/>
would never mind a fresh book added or ink as  a kind soul doing a <br/>
repair only insures the next visitor a happy find! So this fall I'll <br/>
check my boxes in Ky. and hopefully plant a few  along the drive to <br/>
Louisville and find a few too. <br/>
<br/>
I once found my hitchhiker "Home is where the heart is" I took it <br/>
along from that box and had one of my 4-H kids plant it on vacation. <br/>
It gave me a chance to show  the family where and with whom it had <br/>
been with and to move it along to a out of state place.That was in <br/>
the very begining of my  letterboxing " career" and we were thrilled. <br/>
I have not found any of my others but once Wanda and Pete had one and <br/>
stopped by so I could look through the book before they sent it on <br/>
its way.  Finding one would be a treat anywhere anytime. <br/>
