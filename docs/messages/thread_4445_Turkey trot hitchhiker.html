&gt; Subject: Traveller Update. Turkey Trot<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  The Varrell Family created the traveller. While I was out <br/>
&gt; playing hooky today in CT, I made with my first stamp exchange <br/>
&gt; with...<br/>
&gt;   The Varrell Family.  I did not expect to see any other boxers in <br/>
&gt; the Friedman Forest but they pulled into the parking lot just ahead <br/>
&gt; of me.<br/>
&gt;   Later in the afternoon, as I opened my last box for the day, I <br/>
&gt; found their traveller!<br/>
<br/>
(Yahoogroups JUST delivered this digest to me -- THREE WEEKS after the<br/>
fact!!!!!)<br/>
<br/>
How cool!  Given the enormous number of letterboxes in this area, we<br/>
NEVER thought we'd bump into another boxer along the trail, so it was<br/>
really fun to meet you that day.  And, oh, what a peaceful walk in<br/>
Friedman Forest!<br/>
<br/>
I had been wondering how the Turkey Trot HH was faring.  It's my first<br/>
hand carved stamp and our first P, so it holds a special place in my<br/>
heart.  Thanks for reconstructing its travels for us!<br/>
<br/>
Peace -- Debbie<br/>
