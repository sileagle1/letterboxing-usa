I do all the necessary stamping, count them as finds, take tem and leave them at another box. I do write in the log book that I found it while checking my boxes. Sometimes I even put them in another one of my own letterboxes. So, my answer is yes count it as a find but you do have to get the stamp image in your book and your stamp image in the HH book. That's what I do anyway.....Chuck and Molly<br/>

<br/>
This has happened to me twice, and, on one occassion,<br/>
I went back to a box I'd previously found because I<br/>
knew a HH was there (Picked up Pink Ribbon that way<br/>
about a week ago). I think that, anytime you find a<br/>
box or a HH, it's a find. <br/>
