                    <div class="plaintext-content">This box was hidden on June 19th, 2002 in Hartwood Acres by Erika and Lauren <br/>
Kolod. The box is called "Hartwood Acres Letterbox." Hartwood Acres is <br/>
located in Indiana Township, next to Fox Chapel. The closest city is <br/>
Pittsburgh.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The hike should take approximatly 30-40 minutes. It's an easy trail, older <br/>
kids can use their bikes. There is only one hill of any consequence (unusual <br/>
around here). These clues are appropriate for elementary age kids and they <br/>
should be able to succeed in finding this box.<br/>
<br/>
*Begin at the black curvy sculpture behind the mansion.<br/>
*With your back to the mansion, walk left along the tree line until you find <br/>
the "Bridle                         <br/>
       trail".<br/>
*Follow this trail until the 1st fork, make a left.<br/>
*At the next fork go right. (The paths make a triangular shaped island)<br/>
*Next fork - left. This path will take you down hill thru a field and over a <br/>
small creek.<br/>
      The next portion will be uphill for approx. 15 minutes.<br/>
*Next fork - left<br/>
*At the big intersection, where you have 4 (really 5, one is hiding ahead) <br/>
directions <br/>
      to choose from - continue straight.<br/>
*Just ahead there will be a large tree that bends over the path and back out<br/>
     (S shaped). A few yards ahead of that on your left, aprrox. 25-30 yards <br/>
into the   <br/>
     woods is a tree that has fallen over. The stump is 5ft tall and the tree <br/>
still leans <br/>
     on it. The bottom that broke off looks a lot like an elephants leg and <br/>
foot. <br/>
     The box is in the stump.<br/>
*If you've gone as far as the spooky underground building, you've gone to <br/>
far.<br/>
<br/>
By continuing 10 mins. straight on this path you will come out ahead of the <br/>
mansion.<br/>
