out there.<br/>
Our Letterbox : HH ratio used to be close to 1 in 10, now it's closer to 1<br/>
in 16.<br/>
And with Dave gone most of the time we don't get to box as much as we used<br/>
to.<br/>

&gt; Subject: New Hitchhikers<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Please forward this to the LBNE &amp; LBNA lists:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;    In the Army, we have a saying about getting letters: "You have to<br/>
send<br/>
&gt; them to get them.".  A number of people have been telling me that they<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; never found a hitchiker, or that they only find them rarely.  Our<br/>
percentage<br/>
&gt; of found letterboxes containing HHs has gone down lately, too.<br/>
&gt; &gt;    So I've taken to HH production.  It's fairly easy, since so many<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; are so excited to find a HH that they don't always care if it's a bit<br/>
&gt; goofy-looking.  Good for me, too, because I'm not amazingly good at<br/>
carving.<br/>
&gt; &gt;    Get an eraser and carve a simple picture of anything at all.  Do a<br/>
&gt; circle and call it the "Big Balloon" or something.  Get a little notepad<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; put it in a baggie with the stamp.  Boom, you're done.  Bring it to your<br/>
&gt; next LB find.  They also make lovely "first finder" prizes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;    I think that there are a number of HHs in the bottom of people's<br/>
&gt; backpacks who may not even be letterboxing anymore.  Some get lost in the<br/>
&gt; mail, or put in LBs that get vandalized.  They can be quite perishable, so<br/>
&gt; they have to be renewed.  That, plus there are more new LBs planted, I<br/>
&gt; think, than new HHs made.<br/>
&gt; &gt;    For New Jerseyans, they may even find a new HH in one of the NJ<br/>
Mystery<br/>
&gt; boxes.  I launched one on Sunday while traveling a highway.  I won't say<br/>
&gt; where I planted it.  You may ask "What highway?" or "What mystery?" or<br/>
"What<br/>
&gt; direction?" (on the highway).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Too subtle?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; One of these days, I'll plant a LB which I'll keep well-stocked with<br/>
HHs.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Happy hunting,<br/>
