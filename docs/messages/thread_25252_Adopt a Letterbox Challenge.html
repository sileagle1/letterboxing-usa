<br/>
Many folks have noticed that the trailname "Adoptable" has suddenly planted a letterbox or two in virtually every county in America. What happened was that the Letterboxing North America Webmaster group was concerned about the growing number of letterboxes that were out in the wild but owned by a letterboxer who was not active on the website.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the boxes are alive and well and are actually being maintained by their original planters. But there are also quite a few that are abandoned by the owners. So our decision was to move letterbox clues into the Adoptable trailname when the owner had not logged in to letterboxing.org in 4 years. We felt this was a fair time to go without checking in on the clues online, even if the real letterbox was well maintained. Our apologies to any boxer who has had their clues moved even though they are actually active.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an opportunity to anyone interested in adopting some abandoned letterboxes: we're throwing down a challenge to have these historic letterboxes adopted by the active community. Have a Adopta Box Gathering, go on a Check An Old Box Hike, fix up a box and adopt the clues!<br/>
<br/>
Choi has made it easy: you will notice a one-click Adopt A Box button on the clues in the Adoptable account. No more back and forth with the Webmasters to transfer clues, you can DIY. <br/>
<br/>
We are going adopt 2 or 3 nearby ourselves. Go for it! Jay in CT<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Silver Eagle. There are actually more than "you both" on the LbNA Webmasters team. In the past the group was a little more secretive, but I don't think I'm telling any secrets when I say that Barefoot Lucy and Azobox are also very active members of the management group. Many other people over the years have come and gone as well, and we thank them all. In this case as in many that involve website design and code, it is Choi that did all the heavy lifting.<br/>
<br/>
To answer your question, no. Sorry, but if the placer didn't leave their name on the actual clues it won't show up on the Edit Letterbox screen. The easiest way to find original planters in that case is to search the Letterbox Announce yahoogroup at <br/>
<br/>

Hope that helps, Jay in CT <br/>

On a different note, that page reminds me that I really need to spend some time <br/>
to update my LBNA status.  (laughing)<br/>
<br/>
While I'm being talky, is there anything that can be done about boxes that are <br/>
known to be missing?  Unless the planter puts up a message, I guess, a note in <br/>
the area section at AQ is the best choice?<br/>
<br/>
Happy holidays to everyone!!<br/>

Thanks again,<br/>

Hi MoWizLiz! I see those boxes are still in the Adoptable account. What you do <br/>
to adopt them (or reclaim them) is:<br/>
<br/>
-log in to letterboxing.org with your email and password<br/>
-navigate to the clue page of the box you are interested in adopting<br/>
-click on the little red and white heart icon by the word Adoptable<br/>

&gt; Hi MoWizLiz! I see those boxes are still in the Adoptable account. What you<br/>
&gt; do to adopt them (or reclaim them) is:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -log in to letterboxing.org with your email and password<br/>
&gt; -navigate to the clue page of the box you are interested in adopting<br/>
&gt; -click on the little red and white heart icon by the word Adoptable<br/>
&gt; -LbNA will ask "Are you sure you want to adopt this letterbox?"<br/>
&gt; -click "Yes-adopt box"<br/>
&gt; -it's yours!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope that helps, Jay in CT<br/>

      Hi MoWizLiz! I see those boxes are still in the Adoptable account. What you do to adopt them (or reclaim them) is:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-log in to letterboxing.org with your email and password<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Adopt a Letterbox Challenge<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
Hello fellow Boxers!<br/>
<br/>
Many folks have noticed that the trailname "Adoptable" has suddenly planted a <br/>
letterbox or two in virtually every county in America. What happened was that <br/>
the Letterboxing North America Webmaster group was concerned about the growing <br/>
number of letterboxes that were out in the wild but owned by a letterboxer who <br/>
was not active on the website.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the boxes are alive and well and are actually being maintained by their <br/>
original planters. But there are also quite a few that are abandoned by the <br/>
owners. So our decision was to move letterbox clues into the Adoptable trailname <br/>
when the owner had not logged in to letterboxing.org in 4 years. We felt this <br/>
was a fair time to go without checking in on the clues online, even if the real <br/>
letterbox was well maintained. Our apologies to any boxer who has had their <br/>
clues moved even though they are actually active.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an opportunity to anyone interested in adopting some abandoned <br/>
letterboxes: we're throwing down a challenge to have these historic letterboxes <br/>
adopted by the active community. Have a Adopta Box Gathering, go on a Check An <br/>
Old Box Hike, fix up a box and adopt the clues!<br/>
<br/>
Choi has made it easy: you will notice a one-click Adopt A Box button on the <br/>
clues in the Adoptable account. No more back and forth with the Webmasters to <br/>
transfer clues, you can DIY. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are going adopt 2 or 3 nearby ourselves. Go for it! Jay in CT<br/>
<br/>

Hello fellow Boxers!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many folks have noticed that the trailname "Adoptable" has suddenly planted a <br/>
<br/>
letterbox or two in virtually every county in America. What happened was that <br/>
<br/>
the Letterboxing North America Webmaster group was concerned about the growing <br/>
<br/>
number of letterboxes that were out in the wild but owned by a letterboxer who <br/>
<br/>
was not active on the website.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many of the boxes are alive and well and are actually being maintained by their <br/>
<br/>
original planters. But there are also quite a few that are abandoned by the <br/>
<br/>
owners. So our decision was to move letterbox clues into the Adoptable trailname <br/>
<br/>
when the owner had not logged in to letterboxing.org in 4 years. We felt this <br/>
<br/>
was a fair time to go without checking in on the clues online, even if the real <br/>
<br/>
letterbox was well maintained. Our apologies to any boxer who has had their <br/>
<br/>
clues moved even though they are actually active.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here is an opportunity to anyone interested in adopting some abandoned <br/>
<br/>
letterboxes: we're throwing down a challenge to have these historic letterboxes <br/>
<br/>
adopted by the active community. Have a Adopta Box Gathering, go on a Check An <br/>
<br/>
Old Box Hike, fix up a box and adopt the clues!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Choi has made it easy: you will notice a one-click Adopt A Box button on the <br/>
<br/>
clues in the Adoptable account. No more back and forth with the Webmasters to <br/>
<br/>
transfer clues, you can DIY. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are going adopt 2 or 3 nearby ourselves. Go for it! Jay in CT<br/>

<br/>
For some history behind why he implemented the adoption procedure, then removed it see:<br/>
<br/>
http://blog.atlasquest.com/2008/11/ugly-side-of-letterboxing.html<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that the LbNA webmasters may also get some flack on the new adoption policy. Personally, I'm glad to see LbNA try to do something about all the abandoned boxes in the database. In the past few years, I've read, from frustrated letterboxers, that LbNA stands for "Letterbox Not Available". <br/>
<br/>
I especially agree with this part of Ryan's 2008 thoughts regarding adoption/abandoned boxes:<br/>
<br/>
The whole adoption process actually encouraged people to make <br/>
letterboxes last forever, but in hindsight, I think that's a mistake. As<br/>
 boxes go missing, let them die. Retire them. Open up space for new <br/>
boxes, new people, and new ideas. You can only find a box once, and if <br/>
everyone in an area has already found it, it's not doing anyone any <br/>
good. When it goes missing or is destroyed, replace it with something <br/>
completely new and give those same people a new reason to visit the <br/>
area. Give yourself the opportunity to create something even bigger and <br/>
better. Use your time to create something new for everyone instead of <br/>
maintaining something old for no one.<br/>
<br/>
And one last thing. On AQ you can't adopt a box but you can still go to the box and maintain it. When you do go out to maintain the box you can<br/>
 then post a public message about the condition of the box and whether <br/>
the clues are still accurate. So technically, you can do almost <br/>
everything you could before -  but now you can't be listed as the <br/>
official adopter.<br/>

Hello fellow Boxers!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many folks have noticed that the trailname "Adoptable" has suddenly planted a <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
letterbox or two in virtually every county in America. What happened was that <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the Letterboxing North America Webmaster group was concerned about the growing <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
number of letterboxes that were out in the wild but owned by a letterboxer who <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
was not active on the website.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many of the boxes are alive and well and are actually being maintained by their <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
original planters. But there are also quite a few that are abandoned by the <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
owners. So our decision was to move letterbox clues into the Adoptable trailname <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
when the owner had not logged in to letterboxing.org in 4 years. We felt this <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
was a fair time to go without checking in on the clues online, even if the real <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
letterbox was well maintained. Our apologies to any boxer who has had their <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
clues moved even though they are actually active.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here is an opportunity to anyone interested in adopting some abandoned <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
letterboxes: we're throwing down a challenge to have these historic letterboxes <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
adopted by the active community. Have a Adopta Box Gathering, go on a Check An <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Old Box Hike, fix up a box and adopt the clues!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Choi has made it easy: you will notice a one-click Adopt A Box button on the <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
clues in the Adoptable account. No more back and forth with the Webmasters to <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
transfer clues, you can DIY. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are going adopt 2 or 3 nearby ourselves. Go for it! Jay in CT<br/>

something rather than helping to clean up some of those boxes that have just <br/>
been abandoned... to give a new owner the opportunity to give it some long lost <br/>
TLC... to either keep a box where it is or to give it a face lift... new stamp.. <br/>
new place... new clues... does that make any sense? (It's 3:30 in the morning <br/>
and I'm at work... sometimes the brain doesn't fire on all cylanders...LOL)<br/>
 <br/>
But then again I could be talking out the side of my face which ain't far from <br/>
the truth and that I am always happy to accept.  :-D  LOL (BOY I need a nap!! <br/>
LOL)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the information everyone... especially those links as to some <br/>
reasoning behind it.  I don' t know... I'd like to see some of those boxes find <br/>
new owners so that TLC could be credited where credit should be due... people <br/>
seem to like ownership and recognition... <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Y'all see those commercials for the ASCPA where they have some sad Sarah <br/>
McLaughin song playing in the background while they show pictures of pets that <br/>
need adoption... I have something similar going thru my head about the adoption <br/>
of abandoned letterboxes!!! LOL  (Oh Lord I need a vacation!!! LOL)  See this is <br/>
what happens when I finally have some down time to sit and think!!  This is the <br/>
kind of junk my mind comes up with!! :-P  tee hee hee<br/>
<br/>
Oh well... back to work... UGH!! :D<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all the feedback and good information, everyone!! :)  I really <br/>
appreciate it!! :)<br/>
<br/>
Happy days!! :)<br/>

It's not like Ryan to make decisions without at least a couple of good, <br/>
well-explained reasons.<br/>
<br/>
For some history behind why he implemented the adoption procedure, then removed <br/>
it see:<br/>
<br/>
http://blog.atlasquest.com/2008/11/ugly-side-of-letterboxing.html<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that the LbNA webmasters may also get some flack on the new adoption <br/>
policy. Personally, I'm glad to see LbNA try to do something about all the <br/>
abandoned boxes in the database. In the past few years, I've read, from <br/>
frustrated letterboxers, that LbNA stands for "Letterbox Not Available". <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I especially agree with this part of Ryan's 2008 thoughts regarding <br/>
adoption/abandoned boxes:<br/>
<br/>
The whole adoption process actually encouraged people to make <br/>
letterboxes last forever, but in hindsight, I think that's a mistake. As<br/>
boxes go missing, let them die. Retire them. Open up space for new <br/>
boxes, new people, and new ideas. You can only find a box once, and if <br/>
everyone in an area has already found it, it's not doing anyone any <br/>
good. When it goes missing or is destroyed, replace it with something <br/>
completely new and give those same people a new reason to visit the <br/>
area. Give yourself the opportunity to create something even bigger and <br/>
better. Use your time to create something new for everyone instead of <br/>
maintaining something old for no one.<br/>
<br/>
And one last thing. On AQ you can't adopt a box but you can still go to the box <br/>
and maintain it. When you do go out to maintain the box you can<br/>
then post a public message about the condition of the box and whether <br/>
the clues are still accurate. So technically, you can do almost <br/>
everything you could before - but now you can't be listed as the <br/>
official adopter.<br/>

Basically they say "because Ryan won't let you."  :)<br/>

Those are 2 excellent posts from Ryan as too why you can't adopt a letterbox on <br/>
AQ. Thanks for posting those links OF. <br/>
