either looking for or hiding letterboxes--or both, and I'm no <br/>
exception.  =)<br/>
<br/>
So far, I've hidden four letterboxes and found three.  I intend to <br/>
find a couple of more later this afternoon to boot.<br/>
<br/>
The Ball Point Letterbox<br/>
------------------------<br/>
Placed: May 26, 2001<br/>
State: Oregon<br/>
County: Don't know, but whatever one The Dalles falls in is probably <br/>
it.<br/>
Nearest town: Maupin (about 40 miles south of The Dalles)<br/>
URL: http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Letterboxing/ballPoint.html<br/>
<br/>
John Day Fossil Beds NM Series<br/>
------------------------------<br/>
Placed: May 26-27, 2001<br/>
State: Oregon<br/>
County: Several, actually.  <br/>
Nearest town: Fossil<br/>
# in Series: 3<br/>
URL: <br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Letterboxing/johnDayFossilBeds.html<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how you'll want to list this one on the letterboxing <br/>
website, but I hid a letterbox in each of the three units that make <br/>
up John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.  Each of the units is <br/>
separated by about 50 miles and spreads across more than one county.  <br/>
Each of them have different "nearest towns" as well, but Fossil seems <br/>
to be a location central to each of them.  I believe at least one of <br/>
them falls in Wasco county and another falls in Grant county.  Need a <br/>
better map.  *grumble*  Or perhaps one of them falls in Wheeler <br/>
county.  Okay, I just don't know.  =)  I'd probably fit it into the <br/>
North Central Oregon category.  That looks about right.  (In fact, <br/>
that's probably where the Ball Point Letterbox should also be <br/>
located.)  I'd probably use Fossil as a reference point, though, so <br/>
I'd list it with that as the nearest town and whatever county it <br/>
happens to fall in.  Does anyone here have a better map of Oregon <br/>
than I do?  =)  I'm not as familiar with North-Central Oregon as I <br/>
should be.<br/>
<br/>
As for letterboxes I've found recently (all by Der Mad Stamper):<br/>
---------------------------------------<br/>
* Found the Multnomah Falls letterbox on my second attempt.  Tricky, <br/>
Mitch.  Fooled me the first time around.  It's no wonder I'm the <br/>
first person to sign it in over a year!  =)  I think it may have <br/>
flooded too, since there was a large puddle of water in the box when <br/>
I found it.  (Fortunately, the plastic zip-lock bags kept everything <br/>
dry.)<br/>
<br/>
* The Triple Falls letterbox is going to need a new notebook soon.  <br/>
It's well over half full and filling rapidly!  Reading the messages <br/>
in it, I get the impression it's found accidentally as often as it's <br/>
actively searched for.  It also seems to be hidden near where several <br/>
people (and pets) like to pee if the messages people write in the <br/>
book are true.  (e.g. Found it while looking for a place to pee!)  <br/>
Hmm....  Wash your hands after handling this letterbox....  =)<br/>
<br/>
* The Japanese Gardens letterbox--you didn't mention we'd practically <br/>
have to bushwack to get to that one!  =)  I like the hiding place, <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
* The Warrior Rock letterbox: What is that stamp made out of?  I also <br/>
suspect this letterbox might not last long if a good flood comes <br/>
along.  It seems like this area would be prone to flooding, and it's <br/>
not really locked into that hole like the Multnomah Falls box is.<br/>
<br/>
That's it for me.  =)<br/>

Thanks for planting letterboxes in the John Day Fossil Beds area, Ryan!<br/>
Whenever I get out that way I stay at the Shaniko Hotel and usually it's<br/>
because I'm on the way to the beautiful National Monument where you have<br/>
placed letterboxes!   Maupin is also a fine place for a letterbox.  This<br/>
is so exciting.  You are the first one to place letterboxes in Central<br/>
Oregon.  WELL DONE!!!  <br/>
<br/>
By the way...we are thinking about rescuing Quackers next weekend if we<br/>
can.<br/>

<br/>
I have a better map of the area that shows the John Day Fossil Beds <br/>
National Monument spanning Wheeler county and stretching (just <br/>
barely) into Grant county.  The city of Fossil and two of the three <br/>
units making up the NM are in Wheeler county, so it probably fits <br/>
best there.  The third unit making up the NM is within five miles of <br/>
Wheeler county too, even if it is technically in Grant.<br/>
<br/>
The Ball Point letterbox looks like it falls into Wasco county.<br/>
<br/>
On another note:<br/>
<br/>
Found two more letterboxes today at Council Crest and Marquam Trail.  <br/>
Speaking of which, I know where YOU were today, Amanda.  *snicker*  <br/>
It looks like Amanda beat me to the Council Crest box earlier in the <br/>
day to be the first to sign the guestbook!  =)  She hadn't found the <br/>
Marquam Trail one, though.  At least not by the time I had found it, <br/>
although I suppose it's possible she was still in the area and <br/>
looking for it.  The Council Crest box was pretty drenched, but I <br/>
think Amanda did a noble job cleaning it back up.<br/>
<br/>
Mitch: The Marquam Trail box said the box was in a tall, dead tree.  <br/>
There were no dead trees in the immediate area, so I looked in a <br/>
tall, live one and found the box.  I'm happy to report that the tree <br/>
is alive and well.  =)  Seeing as you hid it in January, though, and <br/>
it wasn't an evergreen, it probably looked pretty dead when you found <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, a couple of weeks ago I tried to find the Pooch Place Letterbox <br/>
at Willow Creek.  Failed miserably.  Can I request a new clue?  =)  I <br/>
found one tree which I thought fit the clue you gave pretty well, but <br/>
I wasn't able to find any letterboxes in the area.  And I can't even <br/>
be absolutely sure that's the right tree I'm hunting around in.  Has <br/>
anyone been able to find this box yet or is it just me?  Anyhow, I'll <br/>
probably give it another whirl some afternoon when I have nothing <br/>
better to do and the traffic on Highway 26 keeps me from venturing <br/>
out any farther than Beaverton.  =)<br/>
<br/>
What a great weekend!<br/>

<br/>
You know, it's kind of funny, but I didn't go there with the <br/>
intention of hiding letterboxes.  I've wanted to see the John Day <br/>
Fossil Beds area ever since I moved to Oregon (about 1 1/2 years ago) <br/>
and I figured Memorial Day weekend was a good time to do it.  <br/>
However, I bought my stamp carving stuff--just in case I got bored <br/>
late at night with nothing better to do.  =)  (I went by myself, so <br/>
nobody else would be around to entertain me.)<br/>
<br/>
As it turns out, I've discovered that if I can't find letterboxes <br/>
when I go somewhere, I have this uncontrollable desire to hide them <br/>
instead.  =)  The Los Osos Oaks series I hid in California--I didn't <br/>
go there with the intention of hiding lots of letterboxes.  But when <br/>
I found none on the letterboxing website within a hundred miles, I <br/>
*HAD* to hide some.  I couldn't help myself.<br/>
<br/>
The Saddle Mountain hike I did--I didn't go out specifically to hide <br/>
a letterbox.  One of my co-workers walked up to me that morning and <br/>
asked if I'd like to play hooky that afternoon and hike up Saddle <br/>
Mountain.  SURE!  When I found no clues for letterboxes hidden in the <br/>
area, I grabbed a stamp I had carved earlier in the week (Quackers) <br/>
to hide it.  I HAD to!  I couldn't help myself.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Same goes for the John Day Fossil Beds area.  I didn't go with the <br/>
intention of hiding them.  But when I got there, I felt like there <br/>
NEEDED to be some out there, and if nobody else was going to do it, <br/>
then I was.  =)  However, I didn't have any pre-carved stamps from <br/>
earlier in the week to hide, so I made those on the fly as I hid <br/>
them.  Which was actually kind of nice.  Overlooking the national <br/>
monument and carving stamps to pass the time.  =)  Which also let me <br/>
make stamps designed specifically for the area I was hiding them in.  <br/>
Well, actually, the last stamp I hid--Painted Hills--carving that <br/>
stamp wasn't much fun.  Darned bugs were driving me crazy and I could <br/>
feel myself getting sunburned as I worked on it.  I think I made that <br/>
stamp in record time.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I hope you enjoy finding them the next time you get in the <br/>
area.  It is a nice area.  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; By the way...we are thinking about rescuing Quackers next weekend <br/>
&gt; if we can.<br/>
<br/>
Say hi to Quackers for me if you find him!  =)  <br/>
