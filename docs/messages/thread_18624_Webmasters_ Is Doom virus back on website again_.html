<br/>
I'm concerned that letterbox "Fish-or-mans Personal Traveler" is back <br/>
on the website again!!!<br/>
<br/>
I'm not going to click on it again and find out what happens.<br/>
<br/>
Last time it was there, which was Thursday, I clicked on it and my <br/>
computer was trashed. It was an expensive click on my part. My <br/>
computer repair person said it was the "Doom" virus!! She e-mailed <br/>
you on Thursday, telling you about it. The letterbox was then removed.<br/>
<br/>
Thought you would want to know,<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
