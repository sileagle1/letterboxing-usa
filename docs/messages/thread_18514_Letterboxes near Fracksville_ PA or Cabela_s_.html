***************************************************<br/>
Pottsville is about 20 miles north of Cabelas.  There are several boxes close <br/>
by though, including Pinnacle and Pulpit Rock.  I don't know the status of <br/>
these boxes though, I have not searched for them yet.<br/>
<br/>
About ten miles south is Blue Marsh Lake, where you will find the 4 <br/>
letterboxes in Stamp Collection.  I found the first two of these, in good condition, <br/>
last week.  A heads up, they are long, and it was about five miles of hilly <br/>
hiking to get those two.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

Don't know of any near Cabela's, but if you plant one let us know. Cabela's <br/>

Not to mention I have another box ready to be planted just down the <br/>

you don't want to visit the bustling metropolis of Ashland, PA (SO <br/>
