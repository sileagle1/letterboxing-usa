<br/>
I made it home safe and sound, although the journey had to be made <br/>
carefully and slowly.<br/>
<br/>
It appears that the vote is a resounding YES to my award of the <br/>
Lettering Purple Heart.  Will the person who currently has it please <br/>
email me so I can forward that jewel my direction?  At least I'll get <br/>
a really cool stamp and story to add to my journal while I <br/>
contemplate my orthopedic foot appliance.  <laughing>\<br/>
<br/>
Or, if this isn't the way it's done, will some kind soul tell me what <br/>
I need to do to receive it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks bunches!<br/>
