I did a whole lot of hunting this weekend for boxes. The good news I <br/>
found 5.And the bad news is I ended up not finding 4.<br/>
<br/>
The 4 MIA are :<br/>
Gordon's Pond Letterbox in Rehobeth Beach,DE (I reported it to the <br/>
planter)<br/>
The Owl and the Pussycat at James Farm Ecological Preserve in DE. (I <br/>
think I told the right Firefly about this one) <br/>
Henlopen Tower Letterbox in Cape Henlopen State Park DE (I think I <br/>
told the right person about this one too)<br/>
And lastly:<br/>
The Cape Henlopen Devil Letterbox (I think I told the right person <br/>
about this one too)<br/>
<br/>
Is this the place to report such things, or am I over stepping the <br/>
uses of this chat group. Thanks for listening! <br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>
Sam I am <br/>

</p><p>I just wanted to reassure you.  Not everyone finds 100's of boxes, or even a box every time they go out.  Boxes are still few and far between here in Maine and those that are here are nice and challenging.  There have been several times that my husband and I have made 3 tries before finally nabbing a particular box.  Don't give up.  I am just of the opinion that the boxes are greater prizes when they are hard to find!  Keep it up.  (By the way, I have never found 5 in one day or even in one weekend, probably rarely have I found that many in one month!)
