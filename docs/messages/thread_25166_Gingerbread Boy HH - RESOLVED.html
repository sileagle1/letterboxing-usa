&gt; While I was boxing somewhere in New England I found a box in which was a LOGBOOK ONLY for the Gingerbread Boy HH. Have no idea where the stamp went. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cannot figure out who released this HH back in 5/25/08 (stamp is not familiar to me.) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If this is yours please email off list if you want me to mail this log book back to you. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or maybe you found the stamp in your backpack and thought it was a cootie? It was a very nice carve (as per the cover.) <br/>

Truly amazing! Most of the time you never find out anything about HH's. They moulder at the bottom of back packs or in obsure mystery boxes for years at a time.<br/>
