&gt;Bookworm and I did Just Beth's Presidential series last week and<br/>
&gt;can't wait for the next installment.  The stamps were impressive, and<br/>
&gt;I hear that round two has been planted.  The park they are in has a<br/>
&gt;lovely lake,lots of picnic opportunities and the stamps are close<br/>
&gt;enough that even very little ones or your non-letterboxing family<br/>
&gt;members could enjoy the walk throuh the woods.  I think a stroller<br/>
&gt;could even be taken on the path, though you may want to wait for the<br/>
&gt;snow melt to dry up a little.<br/>
&gt;Thanks Just Beth!<br/>
