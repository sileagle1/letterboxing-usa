<br/>
When we hide a box in a public place we are always taking a risk on <br/>
its loss. <br/>
<br/>
Requiring a login might make us "feel" safer but I will bet that it <br/>
would not significantly change the statistics on box losses. <br/>
Animals, muggles, geocachers, homeless, weather, all take their toll <br/>
on letterboxes. <br/>
<br/>
The best way to prevent box loss is a better hiding place. <br/>
<br/>
I have had boxes disappear because of ninnys, vandals, crooks, <br/>
homeless, gardeners, animals, and more. But the boxes lost to ninnys <br/>
could have had better hiding places. I'll just keep replacing them, <br/>
and hide them better next time. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile if you feel you need a "curtain", some way of making <br/>
it "harder" to find a box, there are lots of ways: longer hikes, <br/>
more complicated clues, mystery clues, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing has always been dedicated to being open. If limiting <br/>
that freedom is not going to significantly help or change things, I <br/>
would be hesitant to nibble away at that freedom. <br/>
