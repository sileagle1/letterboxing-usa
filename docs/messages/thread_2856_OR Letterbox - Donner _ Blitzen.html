This letterbox is located in the breathtaking Steens Mountain area.  The<br/>
river was originally called the Dunder und Blizten (thunder and<br/>
lightening in German) and changed later to Donner und Blizten.  It is<br/>
said that the locals refer to the river as just "The Blitzen.  The<br/>
terrain and clues are easy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LOCATION:  Harney County, Frenchglen, Oregon<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:  From the very small town of Frenchglen in Southeastern<br/>
Oregon, follow the signs for campgrounds.  Turn into Page Springs<br/>
campground.  It will be on your right hand side and signs will make it<br/>
obvious.  You don't have to pay a fee to park at the trailhead, only if<br/>
you get a site and camp.  Go South through the campground all the way to<br/>
the end past sites 12, 13 &amp; 14 to the Donner und Blitzen trailhead<br/>
parking.  <br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  Go through the turnstyle and follow the trail.  The Blitzen<br/>
River is your companion to the right.  At some point during your meander<br/>
there will be a tree to your right with VERY exposed roots toward the<br/>
river.  On the trail from this "rooty" tree go approximately 17 steps<br/>
till you reach a spot in the trail between rock and tree.  Go 14 steps<br/>
up at 150 degrees behind the overhanging rock.  To your left is a secret<br/>
cave where this letterbox resides.  Poke a stick in first as snakes or<br/>
other creatures live in this community.  There is a rock at the<br/>
entrance to the cave to hide the letterbox.  Please make sure you are<br/>
descreet and replace the box and rock so it is well-hidden as this spot<br/>
and what you're up to can be seen from the trail.<br/>

was on sabbatical in OR in'79, I always wanted to get way over to <br/>
Steens Mt. from Corvallis, but never made it.  I guess its remoteness <br/>
was part of the attraction.  Well, maybe some day . . .<br/>
