<br/>
I found the Deaf Beaver letterbox this past Sunday. It was hidden near the <br/>
Canadian border in New York, about 10 meters from the parking lot of the <br/>
Duty Free shop on I-81, directly across the road from the US customs <br/>
booths, and behind a row of utility boxes. Don't ask me what those things <br/>
are. Transformers? Generators? No idea. Anyway, I found the box very <br/>
quickly and got back into the car to open it up. Before I even had a <br/>
chance to do any stamping a couple of US customs officials came over and <br/>
asked what we were doing and why I went behind the utility boxes. It took <br/>
a long time to explain everything and we had to give them the box and our <br/>
passports, and then wait for an hour while they read the LbNA website. <br/>
Eventually a state trooper came back to our car to return our passports <br/>
and the logbook. For some strange reason they kept the stamp, though. I <br/>
want to get it back so I can stamp it into my journal!<br/>
<br/>
The state trooper requested that I have the clues removed from the LbNA <br/>
web site. Does anybody know if these clues are posted anywhere else? I <br/>
emailed the owner of the LB, but haven't received a reply yet.<br/>

Whoa! Scary story. I spent a few hours at the canadian<br/>
boarder because I didn't have any ID for my kids.<br/>
Those guys are serious.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I can't believe where that was placed!  A utility box is one of the <br/>
places a sabator or terrorist would go to disable things.  Of course <br/>
they didn't want it there!  A while back I was searching for the box <br/>
on Liberty Island.  The place was packed with all sorts of <br/>
paramilitary and SWAT type police.  I was getting nervous snooping <br/>
around and finally gave up.  That was 3 months before 911!  I can't <br/>
imagine what it must be like now.  I read that it was removed <br/>
recently and I was glad to hear it.<br/>
<br/>
People snooping around in the woods isn't that unusual.  All sorts of <br/>
nature lovers are always poking around.  However, once you're in a <br/>
monument or other such area, that's not the case.  It's not just <br/>
about homeland securtity either.  I once heard of a person at <br/>
Gettysburg who was walking around with his head down receiving a <br/>
citation on suspicion of being a souvener collector.<br/>
<br/>
Please try to be a little more sensative to these issue when you <br/>
place your boxes.<br/>

Unfortunately we live in a post- 9/11 world.  Many terror suspects have filtered into the USA via Canada.  So I can understand the suspicion.  I hope the stamp is able to be recovered and the box can be moved to a better location.<br/>
