                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a quick note that the following boxes are alive and well:<br/>
<br/>
Tyson's Witch - went and did this one before work this morning.  That <br/>
hill just about killed me, but the box is safe and sound.  Loved the <br/>
story. : )  Even got to see a baby bunny on the way out. : )<br/>
<br/>
Fort Marcy - great box site!  Glad we went early in the morning <br/>
before it got busy.  <br/>

McCarty Farm Letterboxes (Danaus plexippus and Honesty)<br/>
- we had stamped in to Sir Mooseness last year, but never managed the <br/>
other two boxes til now.  Wonderfully quiet park - the walk was quite <br/>
a hike, but we enjoyed it.  Got completely covered with spiderwebs <br/>
trying to get to the last box.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad we could clear the way for you. : )  We went really early in the <br/>
morning and felt at times we weren't even on a trail it was so <br/>
overgrown!  Thankfully there were lots of markers on the trees.  I <br/>
sent my poor husband ahead of me to be spider patrol and he was just <br/>
coated after awhile (shudder).  We took the shortcut too. : D  <br/>
