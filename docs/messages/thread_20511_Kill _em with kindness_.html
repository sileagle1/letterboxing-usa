really intense efforts not to let it take over my rare Sunday out of <br/>
clinic. This whole thing has a way of snatching our life's breath <br/>
away. If you find yourself thinking of these artificial conflicts <br/>
when instead you should be noting how that hummingbird's throat <br/>
feathers glint just so, or how that sparkle in your lover's eye is <br/>
the truest thing you've ever seen, it's a sign. It ain't/they aren't <br/>
worth your time.<br/>

Wishing you warmth and lots of feathered glinty moments this winter, <br/>

We have passed the Autumnal Equinox and the days are getting <br/>
shorter.  Now, night comes quickly. It's time to kindle that inner <br/>
light and warmth that combats the cold and the darkness.<br/>
