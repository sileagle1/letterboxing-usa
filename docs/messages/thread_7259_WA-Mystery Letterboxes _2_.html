Fish Head and Fish Tail<br/>
Planted 8/28/02<br/>
By Amanda from Seattle<br/>
<br/>
These stamps are two parts to a whole.  You have the Fish Head and <br/>
the Fish Tail and you have to find both of them to put them together <br/>
and form the whole Fish! :-)<br/>

<br/>
He may have been foolhardy when he made a large purchase of land to <br/>
the north, but it was no folly to name this park after him! <br/>
<br/>
 Take the road towards the amphitheater and park at the pavilions <br/>
before the Fish Hatchery.  Take the road (no vehicles allowed) down <br/>
to the Lake.  At the Lake, turn to the left and walk until you reach <br/>
a small building.  Climb the first set of stairs on your left. At the <br/>
fork go right past the white house and chain link fence. When you <br/>
reach an intersection with a gravel path there will be a bench and a <br/>
sign board. Go left on the gravel path for approximately 95 steps. On <br/>
your right will be a short path to a large tree. To the left of the <br/>
tree is a small thick hollow log.  The Fish Head Letterbox is in this <br/>
log covered by loose bark and debris.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on the gravel path and take a right just before you reach <br/>
the road (taking a left down the road would return you to your car). <br/>
But you take the right just before the road and at the fork go left. <br/>
Go over 3 boardwalks and the first cedar tree you see on your right <br/>
has the Fish Tail Letterbox in a crevice at its base. (in the rear of <br/>
the tree and covered by cedar needles and debris).<br/>
<br/>
You can backtrack to the gravel path and take a left on the road to <br/>
your car or continue on this path to the picnic area and then <br/>
backtrack left along the road to your car.<br/>
<br/>
Beware of Poison Oak! (at this park, they have kindly labeled most of <br/>
the poison oak areas with signs! Danger! :-)<br/>
As always, please be discreet.  <br/>
Use caution when reaching into crevices and dark places.<br/>
Also, read the waiver of responsibility and disclaimer.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Amanda from Seattle<br/>
