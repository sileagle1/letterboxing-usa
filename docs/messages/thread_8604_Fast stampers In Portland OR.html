<br/>
As for the Oregon City box I did find it on the weekend first one in it and it is safe and sound. Like you I wish someone would venture out and find the Canadian Series Mystery boxes....I think there are about 7 of them. But then again maybe someone has and I need to check it out.<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone planning on going to Lakewood on November 2??? <br/>
Cheers<br/>

I'll be there.  I have to--I'm bringing the event stamp.  Which <br/>
reminds me, I've gotta get started on that.  I dropped by that park <br/>
on my way down from Seattle to "scout out" the area for potential <br/>
event stamp ideas, and of course look for the boxes that were <br/>
already there.  =)  (Alive and well, I might add!)  I also hid a <br/>
letterbox there for the Grand Event.  =)  (Clues will not be <br/>
provided until the day of the event, though.  Be there, or else you'll <br/>
miss it!)<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, you'll see signs saying not to leave valuables <br/>
in your car.  They mean this!  When we first got there, a minivan <br/>
had had a window busted out and a purse stolen from it which <br/>
apparently had happened within ten minutes before our arrival.  <br/>
(If you see a lot of broken glass in the parking area, that's the <br/>
reason.)<br/>
<br/>
Farewell!<br/>
