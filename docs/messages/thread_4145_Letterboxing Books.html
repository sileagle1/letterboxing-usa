<br/>
Welcome and thanks for all the new letterboxes.  We found hidden marker and <br/>
are looking forward to finding your others!  Your clues are excellent.  How <br/>
did you find that marker anyway?<br/>
<br/>
For our log books we were using Mead Fat Little Bungee books that we found <br/>
at CVS.  They have a plastic front cover and an attached elastic that holds <br/>
the book shut and are 180 pages long.  I am very concerned that the books <br/>
hold up since our boys are aged 5 and 1.  I found that as we got to the <br/>
middle of the book the outside edges of the pages started to hang out of the <br/>
book and get folded and one of the elastics broke.  Then I found plastic <br/>
covered little ring binders that have index cards with holes.  We each have <br/>
a ring binder that we keep at home.  I take another ring binder with lots of <br/>
empty sheets and we stamp into one book and then put our sheets into our own <br/>
books when we get back.  Since they're index card material they hold up a <br/>
little bit better and it is nice to have the blank side for the stamp.  I <br/>
bought the binders on clearance so now the challenge will be to find more!  <br/>
I have some (maybe all) of our letterboxes set up with them, too.  I may <br/>
have to make pages by using a hole punch.  I have to do something about it <br/>
soon because the Feed Store letterbox is almost full.  The box for index <br/>
cards is a great idea since our books are getting pretty full.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we'll see you on the trail!<br/>

Subject: Is this acceptable?<br/>
<br/>
When I find a letterbox I have been stamping a 5" x 3" index card on the<br/>
clear side. I then can write date found and any other notations I may want<br/>
to make on the reverse. I would think that hiking through the woods with the<br/>
same notebook would put quite a bit of wear on the book. When I get home the<br/>
card goes into a little file box and be looked over at any time just as a<br/>
book could. The next time I go letterboxing I carry a few new note cards. In<br/>
this way I keep the stamps of my finds clean and it is much easier to take<br/>
care of in the woods. I am new to letterboxing so my question is: Is this an<br/>
acceptable way to record finds? Does any one else do this? Hoping to get<br/>
some opinions on this before I get into this hobby even more and find I may<br/>
have been doing it the wrong way......Chuck Straub P4F8<br/>
