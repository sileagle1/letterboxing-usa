6 Green<br/>
Letterboxing Adventure<br/>
<br/>
Around the Pond and through the Woods...<br/>
<br/>
It you are starting from Providence or Hartford, take Route 6. <br/>
Goodwin State Forest is located in Hampton, Connecticut. There is a <br/>
sign on the highway that says `James L. Goodwin State Forest'. Turn <br/>
here onto Potter Road, a road lined with the state flower - Mountain <br/>
Laurel. As you drive down the road you will pass a sign on your right <br/>
that says `James L. Goodwin Conservation Center', and on your left a <br/>
backyard arboretum to enjoy before or after your adventure. On the <br/>
right you will come to a small parking lot, park here.<br/>
<br/>
Across the street from the parking lot is a small gray house with a <br/>
sign above the door that says Nature Center. Sand on the stone steps <br/>
and locate the picnic pavilion. From the picnic pavilion take a <br/>
compass heading of 60 degrees and proceed 29 paces. You will now be <br/>
at a big brown gate. Follow the dirt path after it. As you follow the <br/>
path you will come close to the highway and then the pond. You will <br/>
see two small bridges, cross them. Now you are entering the woods.<br/>
<br/>
Look around - you will see medium height pine trees and lots of <br/>
roots - don't trip. The trail stays near the water, watch out for <br/>
holes in the ground. Keep following the white trail. Don't he fooled -<br/>
 stay near the water. Keep your eyes on the lake for duck houses and <br/>
beaver lodges. Soon you will encounter rocks covered with moss and <br/>
lichen. Stay focused your journey is only beginning.<br/>
<br/>
Stop and find where the beavers have been busy. Walk up the slope and <br/>
enjoy the view of the pond. Find the only long needle pine tree near <br/>
the water. From there take a compass heading of 320 degrees and <br/>
continue to follow the white blazes in that direction. Immediately <br/>
you will cross a great landmark, an old dirt road (Cedar Swamp Road). <br/>
Continue on the white blazed trail. Be on the lookout for a huge, <br/>
blazed V shaped oak tree. From there take a compass heading of 74 <br/>
degrees and continue on the trail. Hang in there you are almost to <br/>
letterbox 1. Soon you will spy the state flower (Mountain Laurel). <br/>
Continue on until you find two major tails that cross - X marks the <br/>
spot. (the trails)<br/>
