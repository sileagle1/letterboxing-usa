                    <div class="plaintext-content">MAYBE the box is still there. We found it last Thanksgiving weekend <br/>
after going over and over and over the same spot, not to mention <br/>
checking out several alternative spots. We couldn't believe it when <br/>
we finally found it. It was right there where it made the most sense, <br/>
right under our noses the whole time. That box is well hidden, if <br/>
somewhat precariously. The grass was short when we went, with no <br/>
surrounding shrubbery. That was a good box so we hope it's still <br/>
there. We'll check next time we go that way, which might be next <br/>
Thanksgiving.<br/>
