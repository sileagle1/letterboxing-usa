Hiking: easy, less than a mile, but the trail can be very soggy after <br/>
a rain.<br/>

Touisset Marsh is owned by Rhode Island Audubon Society. Keep your <br/>
eyes open in all directions as you hike here. The abundance of <br/>
wildlife and interesting plants small and large would thrill John <br/>
James Audubon himself. We wanted to do a wildlife theme, but if we <br/>
made a letterbox for every species we've seen here, this place would <br/>
look like a Tupperware party. So we chose two animals that we've seen <br/>
here more than once that made the biggest impression on us at the <br/>
times we saw them.<br/>
<br/>
Driving directions: From the intersection of Routes 114 (Main Street) <br/>
and 103 (Child Street) in downtown Warren, take Route 103 east 1.9 <br/>
miles to Long Lane. Take a right onto Long Lane. Go 0.8 mile to the <br/>
end and turn left onto Barton Av. Go 0.5 mile more to Touisset Road. <br/>
Go right on Touisset Road, following it around some curves 1.2 miles <br/>
to another big turn to the left. At this turn you'll see Touisset <br/>
Fire Company, Warren Fire Department Station 6. Turn right to go into <br/>
a parking lot next to the fire house.<br/>
