Library after another beautiful fall afternoon of letterboxing in CT! <br/>
Pete told me on the phone earlier that there were a few folks out <br/>
there disgruntled about our intentions to honor our "letterboxing <br/>
heroes", but I don't have time to read the posts, so I'll just have <br/>
to "wing it"! All I can say is that this project has been in the <br/>
works for quite a while. We talked about it with some letterboxers at <br/>
a mini-gathering in May, then presented our ideas at another <br/>
gathering in June, where I even carved the stamp for it in front of a <br/>
bunch of people, including those who call themselves "the reigning <br/>
darlings"! I figured if even those "royals" of our letterboxing <br/>
blogosphere didn't object, and actually commented favorably on my <br/>
stamp - can you believe it?!- then it was probably a good thing to <br/>
present our little award to those we feel have contributed the most <br/>
to letterboxing! (And certainly NO ONE could suggest that all of us <br/>
have contributed equally - certainly some have gone WAY "above and <br/>
beyond"!!!) Anyway, we had already planted a "thank you" box (and <br/>
bonus) in CT, but wanted to find a way to reach a wider public, to <br/>
let them know about these special people, and to  give upcoming <br/>
recipients in other states something to look forward to as well. We <br/>
really suspected that NO ONE in our community would find that <br/>
objectionable! However, as has been revealed in several hobbies of <br/>
ours, it is sometimes those who do the least that complain the most! <br/>
I hope that is not the case, but just know that here we are honoring <br/>
those whose actions speak louder than their words - not the "would be <br/>
kings"  who would like to get "instant fame" without doing ALL the <br/>
hard work of earning it, but those we feel truly deserve it!!!<br/>
Thanks for understanding, <br/>
