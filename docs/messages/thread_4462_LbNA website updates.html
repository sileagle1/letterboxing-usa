                    <div class="plaintext-content">It would be nice if the West Coast were updated.  I went to look up<br/>
Bishop's Close on the website the other day and it wasn't there.  I<br/>
didn't have time to sift through the archives on break at work that day<br/>
and print them off.  What month was this box placed?  I guess I should<br/>
look through the "What's New" section, but I don't think that box is too<br/>
new.  It was placed before I went to New Zealand I think.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...I greatly applaud updates.  My slough series needs to be taken<br/>
off until I can get them placed on the trail since only one box in the<br/>
series remains.  <br/>

updated to correct regions.<br/>
If you suggested a county change, please check it out and make sure I got it<br/>
done.  If it isn't there, please email me off-list and let me know. <br/>
<br/>
I also got the whole New Hampshire / Vermont mess worked out.<br/>

I will be looking at the International regions and Louisiana soon.  <br/>

Oh, and stop replying to contact-the-placer emails. <br/>
