                    <div class="plaintext-content">Seeing the post a few days back by a new letterboxer, I decided to take a quick jaunt to Oaks Bottom to <br/>
search out the newest treasure in the Portland area. The box is just fine but I do worry about its safety after <br/>
the leaves decompose/blow away. Thank you Solstamper and I look forward to your future additions to the <br/>
Oregon box population. Since I was in the general vicinity of my own Oaks Bottom box, I figured I would give it a <br/>
check. This box was replaced a while back but nary a soul has visited it since. It looks mighty empty without a <br/>
single stamp in the log. <br/>
<br/>
I then headed for the newly replaced West Linn Mystery Box. Any stamp carved by the Forest People is one <br/>
that I know is a must-have. This is no exception. I loved the original stamp and this new one is equally <br/>
wonderful. It makes me almost glad that the first one went missing so that I could have this second image in my <br/>
book too. Maybe I should pocket this one so that there will be a third... Funhog<br/>
