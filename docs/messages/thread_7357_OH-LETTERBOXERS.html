I happen to live in Cincinnati, Ohio.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Over the past two or three weeks that <br/>
i have been hunting, I have noted all<br/>
of the Letterboxes that are left open <br/>
by the boxer before me. <br/>
<br/>
  on 3 of Franzsolo's boxes, I was the 2nd person tolog the finds. When I found<br/>
the Boxes, 2 were not in the same place<br/>
(1 of them Franzo even had on his sheet<br/>
to put it back in the SAME spot) and it<br/>
was not.  2 of the 3 had the baggie Unsealed.<br/>
<br/>
  I also was doing maintance on our Clubs 80+ stamps and found that some<br/>
of ours were the same way!!!!  <br/>
<br/>
  I think what is happening is GREED!!<br/>
<br/>
In a rush to see how many letterboxes we can find in a day is superseeding the care of the letterboxes them self. <br/>
<br/>
 Remember, This is a Fun Sport, There is<br/>
no winners or Losers, You will not get a Prize for having the Most nor be heckeled for having the Least. <br/>
<br/>
 Slow down, Take your time and put the<br/>
box back in order and put it back in the<br/>
same spot as it came from (That includes<br/>
the rocks/sticks or brush) That was helping hide the letterbox; as well as<br/>
the baggie being sealed inside to help keep water out.<br/>
<br/>
 Please don't get me wrong, I am NOT<br/>
ratting anyone out or trying to make<br/>
people feel Guilty (Well Maybe a Little<br/>
Guilty  lol) I just need to point out<br/>
just why they need to be put back in<br/>
the same order they were found.<br/>
<br/>
 I have Logged over 300 hours now just in HIDING boxes for Boxers to find. The only one's I wish to replace is the ones that become Lunch for a critter of the woods. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Happy Hunting Everyone..<br/>
