                    <div class="plaintext-content">First, thank you Jay, for your response to my question.  I have really<br/>
learned a lot about letterboxing the last few days--and I am glad.  I<br/>
definitely would have been committing serious breeches of ettiquette had I<br/>
not read the various opinions.  I appreciate the kindess, respect, and<br/>
tolerance shown to me as a "newbie" All of the discussion made me consider<br/>
what iti s about this sport that intrigues me so.  After all, why would an<br/>
overweight 30-somethign mother of three small children want to tromp about<br/>
in this humidity braving spiders, snakes,a nd worst of all, mosquitos on the<br/>
off chance of collecting an inked image?   Heck, ya don't even get to keep<br/>
the stamp!<br/>
<br/>
So, here are my thoughts--mundane as they are--from a newbie about the<br/>
appeal of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
First, it is an activity I can do with my family, outdoors, away from the<br/>
tv, requiring a moderate amount of physical activity (sometimes strenous if<br/>
I take the baby and forget to check the trail for accessability).  This is<br/>
always a good  tihng in our house.  We can do it together and everyone<br/>
"succeeds".<br/>
<br/>
It is educational.  Not only do we learn about different parks and landmarks<br/>
in our area, we are exploring new places on our trips as well.  I never<br/>
woudl have realized "car on a stick" was real.  My hubby is quite excited to<br/>
see it and I know the kids will love it.   We learn a bit of history, a bit<br/>
of geography, some map reading skills,  some logical deduction, and some<br/>
creative thinking, and some math skills.  Especially when we are tryign to<br/>
figure out how many of our paces equal one of the placers.  (Some of you all<br/>
have LONG strides!)  We need ot brush up on local flora (poinon ivy /oak<br/>
/sumac), and fauna, especiallythe reptilian, arachnid, and insect varieties.<br/>
If nothig else, leterboxing is a great form of aversion therapy!  While I do<br/>
not homeschool formally, I do informally and think this is an awesome<br/>
awesome activity for those of that mindset.<br/>
<br/>
And it is just plain intriguing.  I love logic puzzles.  This is a whole new<br/>
dimension, literally.  It is like looking for lost treasure. Did we solve<br/>
the clues correctly?  Will it be there?  What will it be?<br/>
<br/>
So, I will strive to respect the integrity of the sport and appreciate those<br/>
who are taking the time to explain it.  Yeah, I will probably screw up now<br/>
and again, but good intentions and willingness to listen and learn seem to<br/>
go along way around here.  That's good enough for me!<br/>
