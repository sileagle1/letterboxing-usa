make them mystery boxes or not post the clues to this website.  It's <br/>
an awesome place to visit, and it's a shame not have anymore boxes <br/>
there.  Letterboxing at Fort Worden will have to go 'underground'.<br/>

I haven't read through the latest emails yet to see if I'm the only one <br/>
"calling" on this one, but may I strongly discourage this practice? There are <br/>
going to be preserves, parks, and puddles that are inappropriate for <br/>
letterboxing, and one of the criteria for "appropriate" should be whether the <br/>
park managers welcome us there. Sometimes they might be right...another <br/>
solution might be to get involved with the folks that are pulling boxes and <br/>
see if we can effect change from the inside.<br/>

Well, I only said that for the benefit of people that plan to hide <br/>
boxes there in the future.  Me, myself, and I would just take my <br/>
boxes and go somewhere else with them.  I'm sure there's plenty of <br/>
other great places in the area for boxes--why fight the authorities <br/>
if you don't have to?<br/>
<br/>
However knowing that not everyone is the law-abiding citizen that I <br/>
am (*cough cough*), I thought I'd make that suggestion for future <br/>
reference.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Candlelight: I just know what I've heard from Amanda, but she might <br/>
still have that e-mail about where to go or who to talk to about <br/>
picking up your boxes if you so choose.  I'd hate to see that <br/>
guardhouse stamp vanish forever!  Amanda's stamps there, though...  <br/>
*shaking head*  =)  Actually, I shouldn't really say that, because <br/>
she's been replacing them with rather good ones before the boxes were <br/>
pulled.<br/>
