My wife and I do not normally start at night, but sometimes go after <br/>
one or two more after nightfall.  One such attempt was done while <br/>
visiting relatives (my wife's sister and husband) in South Carolina, <br/>
and we went after the "Pocotaligo" letterbox there in Clarendon <br/>
county.  It was total darkness with the exception of a slight moon <br/>
(blocked by the trees), and the one pen-flashlight we shared.  We <br/>
walked the dew-covered, slippery, raised nature boardwalk above a <br/>
swamp to the end while circleing a stick to clear a path through the <br/>
spider webs (and huge spiders) blocking our path.  We heard a splash <br/>
in the swamp, and shined our light onto a water moccacin, and <br/>
continued to search the trees and swamp for other dangers.  We have <br/>
found over 190 letterboxes to date, but this letterbox continues to <br/>
be the most unforgetable.  We don't search for boxes after dark much <br/>
since.<br/>

Hi Lee and Nancy, Apple Valley, CA huh.  You don't hear about that <br/>
place too often.  I was born there back in '61.  I remember hearing <br/>
the sound barrier breaking quite often as a small child.  We lived <br/>
on Sioux Rd.  Last time I was there was to visit my Aunt and Uncle <br/>
about 25 years ago.  They lived down the road from Roy and Dale's <br/>
place.  Well just wanted to say hi to a couple of letterboxers from <br/>
my home town.<br/>

I went after a box in a New Jersey graveyard that recommends going at night for a <br/>
challenge.  The big challenge the first night was finding the graveyard at all.  While the <br/>
entrance is plainly visible during the day, this graveyard, which has been abandoned since <br/>
the beginning of the last century is invisible at night.<br/>
<br/>
Houses have been built up around the graveyard and the entrance is a narrow path <br/>
between some lovely suburban homes.  There are no local streetlights and the area is <br/>
covered by a high tree canopy.  So we're talking "Can't see your hand in front of your face" <br/>
dark.  I had a Noxer friend with me who came along for the thrill but chickened out at the <br/>
prospect of walking into (what felt like) the opening scene of a "Halloween" sequel.   I left <br/>
her behind with my Last Will and Testament and took my Maglite  (AA size) into the heart <br/>
of darkness.<br/>
<br/>
A dog started barking as I walked up the path.  It barked for a long time until the owner <br/>
came out to bring it in as I stood in frozen silence in the shadows.  I followed an old fence <br/>
with my flashlight projecting a mighty 4" circle of illumination.  The path came to a <br/>
deadend at a fence.  The clue said to walk through the gate but I found a big padlock on it <br/>
and could not make out anthing on the other side.  I looked around for another gate, but <br/>
ended up in someone's backyard with a big spotlight on me.  Fortunately, it was a motion <br/>
detector light and no one seemed to be alerted.<br/>
Now having lost my night vision, I backtracked to the path and made my way out to where <br/>
my friend stood at the street with "911" dialed on her phone and her finger on the "Send" <br/>
button.<br/>
<br/>
Defeated, we went back to our hotel.<br/>
<br/>
The next day we made the attempt in broad daylight.  What a difference Day makes.  What <br/>
I could not see in the dark was a 3 foot gap in the fence where I could have easily walked <br/>
through.  We followed the clue to the box and I felt some cold comfort in the fact that if I <br/>
had made it through the fence that night, my flesh would have been shredded by the wall <br/>
of pricker bushes in the overgrown graveyard.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My favorite experience of letterboxing in the dark is much more interesting, but waaaay to <br/>
long to tell here.  I turned that experience into a letterbox itself.  If you are in the <br/>
Washington DC area, check out "Boxing After Dark." <br/>
