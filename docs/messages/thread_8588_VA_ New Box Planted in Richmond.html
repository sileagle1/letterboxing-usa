                    <div class="plaintext-content">A new letterbox was planted at Union Theological Seminary in Richmond, <br/>
Virginia on October 21, 2002, by mlgainey. UTS is in the city of <br/>
Richmond's Northside.<br/>
<br/>
THIS IS A MICROBOX. IT DOES NOT CONTAIN A PENCIL.<br/>
<br/>
The box is hidden in a hole in a tree in front of Watts Chapel.<br/>
<br/>
Please place the box back in its plastic bag and roll the plastic bag <br/>
around the film canister. Push the entire package down into the bottom <br/>
of the hole as far as it will go in order to completely hide the box <br/>
from view. Because this is a college campus, the UTS box is in a <br/>
rather busy area. But I just couldn't pass up such a neat hiding <br/>
place!<br/>
