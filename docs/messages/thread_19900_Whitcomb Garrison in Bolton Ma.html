I've tried to contact the owner of the clue sheet for Whitcomb <br/>
Garrison to ask them to remove the clues to this box since some <br/>
folks have not been treating the site with care (to make matters <br/>
worse the box is missing or at least not in its proper location when <br/>
I went to pull it several weeks back), but I've not gotten a reply.  <br/>
I help maintain the Bolton Letterbox Series, but I don't have edit <br/>
capabilities on a few of the clues in this series (this being one of <br/>
them).  I'll contact Wes to see if he can remove the clues for this <br/>
box from the LBNA site.<br/>
<br/>
I plan to recarve this stamp and locate it in a better spot (it's <br/>
been in this location since the box was planted by the original <br/>
series producers back in the summer of 2000, but I agree this isn't <br/>
a good location).<br/>
