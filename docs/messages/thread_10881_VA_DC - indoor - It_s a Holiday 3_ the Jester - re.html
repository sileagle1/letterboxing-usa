<p>Hi Doubtful Guests!  We were bummed not to have gotten the Valentine's stamp before it went MIA.  So, now we are psyched to try for this new stamp!  Luckily, we have little ones who will be more than delighted to crawl under benches or do whatever is necessary ('cause Mom and Dad don't bend so good anymore! [especially after all that shoveling!]).</p>
<p>What is better for a week of cabin fever anyway than a trip to the MALL!  Waaaahoooo!</p>
<p>Thanks for replacing this box with another indoors one!  BeMa </p>

<div></div>&gt;I have restored the M.I.A. "It's a Holiday". New stamp, new log and 
<div></div>&gt;NEW HIDING PLACE. I hope it will be a little safer here. I hope it 
<div></div>&gt;will be just the thing on a schlusshy weekend for frustrated 
<div></div>&gt;letterboxers. 
<div></div>&gt;Knights of Colombo - please update the website with this text.

<div></div>&gt;It's a Holiday 3: the Jester 
<div></div>&gt;Confirmed MIA Feb 9, 2003 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Placed by Scarab of the Doubtful Guests 
<div></div>&gt;December 13, 2002 
<div></div>&gt;New Valentine stamp 1/14/2, MIA 2/9/3 
<div></div>&gt;Replaced with the Jester 2/21/3 and clues altered. 
<div></div>&gt;Arlington County 
<div></div>&gt;Arlington, Virginia 
<div></div>&gt;Hand made stamp 
<div></div>&gt;Easy, indoors 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Twas the nightmare before Christmas 
<div></div>&gt;And all through the mall 
<div></div>&gt;Anxious shoppers were rushing 
<div></div>&gt;Praying Pentagon City had it all. 
<div></div>&gt;I arrived by the Metro 
<div></div>&gt;And went straight to the top 
<div></div>&gt;To consult with the Wizard 
<div></div>&gt;And visit his shop. 
<div></div>&gt;Puzzling place. Puzzling Wizard. 
<div></div>&gt;"Which it's the number of brown tiles between our doorway you wants." 
<div></div>&gt;"For what, want for what?" 
<div></div>&gt;"Only Santy Claws and that Scarab fellow know and neither one of them 
<div></div>&gt;is telling me. 
<div></div>&gt;Go ask that Joseph at the bank around the corner. 
<div></div>&gt;That's the place to look if he deposited somethin' int it?" 
<div></div>&gt;Joseph, I discovered, was full of hang ups. 
<div></div>&gt;"I haven't a clue," he answered to my enquiries, 
<div></div>&gt;"but you remind me of that puzzling fellow I saw the other day. 
<div></div>&gt;He walked away from our window around the curve of the balcony 
<div></div>&gt;counting the small potted trees. 
<div></div>&gt;Did it several times like he was trying to be sure of something. 
<div></div>&gt;I don't know how long those trees have been there myself, 
<div></div>&gt;Nor how long they'll stay." 
<div></div>&gt;One, two, three ... Finally I sat on the right side of a long white 
<div></div>&gt;bench with a fine view. 
<div></div>&gt;Behind me immediately over my right shoulder was a mall map. 
<div></div>&gt;Across the wide atrium from me the glass elevator rose and fell. 
<div></div>&gt;Almost directly below me I gazed down the tree at Santa on his golden 
<div></div>&gt;chair. 
<div></div>&gt;"Wow, a natural Santa." 
<div></div>&gt;"What's an unnatural Santa, Dad?" 
<div></div>&gt;I reached down between my knees as if I was pulling up my sock, 
<div></div>&gt;And surreptitiously reached under the frontof the bench. 
<div></div>&gt;"May I help you?" asked the guard suspiciously. 
<div></div>&gt;"OH, um, I thought I lost my keys" I said while holding the fuzzy 
<div></div>&gt;velcro covered, black, dual film cannisters in one hand, 
<div></div>&gt;"Wait, here they are in my other pocket." 
<div></div>&gt;"Alright then, happy holidays to you." 
<div></div>&gt;"And to you." Whew. 
<div></div>&gt;I spent a pleasant time recording in the scroll and enjoying the 
<div></div>&gt;expansive view. 
<div></div>&gt;Then I went all the way around and all the way down to celebrate in 
<div></div>&gt;the food court. 
<div></div>&gt;Merry letterboxing to all, and to all a good hike. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;It's now long after Christmas but who wants to let go of the 
<div></div>&gt;holidays. Now when you look down at the food court below, the 
<div></div>&gt;Christmas tree is gone; instead you are looking at the center of an 
<div></div>&gt;octagonal tile pattern. But hey, there is always another holiday 
<div></div>&gt;coming up. I have made "It's a Holiday" a seasonal box with changing 
<div></div>&gt;stamps. The Royal French Court Fashion Valentine went M.I.A. I 
<div></div>&gt;placed a new microbox with the next holiday stamp and changed the 
<div></div>&gt;location slightly. Now showing: "It's a Holiday 3: the Jester". 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Please be discreet. Please do not turn over benches or look like 
<div></div>&gt;you're searching all over if you're not sure. It may go M.IA. again. 
<div></div>&gt;I will note so here. If you find this letterbox missing or damaged 
<div></div>&gt;or are puzzled about the clues write theDoubtfulGuests@yahoo.com.
