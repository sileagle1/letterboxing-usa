You walk softly and carry a BIG stick. You walk away<br/>
slowly and if that doesn't work BEAY THE "BEEP" out of<br/>
them with the Big stick. No only kidding. I would back<br/>
away slowly.<br/>

I've heard that rattle snakes can strike up to about half their body <br/>
length.  (Though when they're coiled up, I suppose it can be hard to <br/>
tell exactly how long they are.  They usually aren't agreeable to <br/>
being measured!)<br/>
<br/>
For those worried about snakes, I'd just like to remind you what it <br/>
must seem like from their point view.  I would imagine something like:<br/>
<br/>
"Good God!!!!  That animal is HUGE!  How the f*** do I get away from <br/>
it?!"<br/>
<br/>
=)  Anyhow, my point being, snakes generally stay away from people.  <br/>
They know you're too big to eat so they have little incentive to <br/>
attack unless they feel cornered.  Stay at least a few feet away from <br/>
them (out of striking range), give them time to get out of the way, <br/>
and you'll probably never have a bad snake encounter.<br/>
<br/>
Also--I heard this bit of trivia--not sure if it's really true or <br/>
not, but I thought it was interesting.  They say people hiking in <br/>
groups of two or more are more likely to be bitten by snakes, and <br/>
it's usually the second or third person in line that gets bitten.  <br/>
The first person just 'scares' the snake and puts them on their <br/>
guard.  It's the next person that gets the brunt of their fury.<br/>
<br/>
So....  if you don't want to be bitten by snakes, make sure you're <br/>
the first one breaking the trail.  ;o)<br/>
