&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>
&gt; From: Radzak, Lee [mailto:lee.radzak@mnhs.org]<br/>

&gt; Subject: Letterbox Consideration<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would like to address this message to the people responsible for<br/>
&gt; generating and hiding the letterboxes, as well as the seekers <br/>
&gt; who go out<br/>
&gt; looking for the letterboxes in the field.  A letterbox was <br/>
&gt; hidden on Split<br/>
&gt; Rock Lighthouse Historic Site some time last year.  We found <br/>
&gt; out about it<br/>
&gt; when one of our historic site guides found it and brought it into the<br/>
&gt; office.  Since no one approached site staff and asked <br/>
&gt; permission to hide the<br/>
&gt; box on the historic site we had no idea what the game is about.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would ask that letterboxers consider a few points.  If you <br/>
&gt; are going to<br/>
&gt; hide a letterbox, especially on a state or federal historic or<br/>
&gt; archaeological site, please contact the management of the site and ask<br/>
&gt; permission and assistance in locating an appropriate hiding <br/>
&gt; place.  This is<br/>
&gt; only common courtesy and will not only insure that an <br/>
&gt; appropriate hiding<br/>
&gt; place is found but that site staff are aware of its presence.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A second consideration is that archaeological and historic sites are<br/>
&gt; protected by law from disturbance of the ground, features, or <br/>
&gt; structures on<br/>
&gt; the site.  In a congested area like Split Rock Light Station it is not<br/>
&gt; possible to allow visitors to leave the paths and established <br/>
&gt; pedestrian<br/>
&gt; routes to dig around in the undisturbed areas.  On numerous <br/>
&gt; occasions we<br/>
&gt; have found letterbox seekers wandering in undisturbed areas <br/>
&gt; and digging in<br/>
&gt; the ground.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would be happy to work with organizers and letterbox <br/>
&gt; seekers to discuss<br/>
&gt; appropriate locations to hide- and seek- letterboxes, as I am <br/>
&gt; sure most<br/>
&gt; administrators of historic properties are.<br/>
&gt; Thank you,<br/>
