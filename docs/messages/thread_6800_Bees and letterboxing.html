<div>Hi folks!  We just spent a great day at the Tolland 
County </div>
<div>4-H fair where we met old friends and new ones in the realm of 
letterboxing.  This is the best hobby ever and meeting other letterboxing 
enthusiasts is great fun!  Thanks to Leader of the Pack and many others for 
all their hard work in promoting this wonderful pastime.  I don't normally 
post to the chat list, but I feel compelled today to share a story.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On the way home, we stopped at a couple boxes in the Coventry 
area  including the Coventry Grammar School Nature Trail, a quick easy kid 
friendly spot, but as my 8 yr old son reached for the box ('cause it was his 
'turn') he stepped on an underground bee's nest and they attacked!  We ran 
out of there as fast as we could and as far as we could before stopping, but he 
had been stung five times!!  Thankfully none of us are allergic but he 
didn't stop screaming for a long time.  If any of you boxers out there are 
allergic to bees, please be sure to carry your epipens with you.  Despite 
what may be on your minds (purple socks, lizards, whatever)  be sure to be 
safe!!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I will contact the school on Monday morning to let them know 
about the bees on their nature trail.  If you read this, don't go 
there!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>On a happy note, our family found our 200th box today, and 
even though "Clyde" swears he'll never go letterboxing again, I know that 
tomorrow is a new day and a new start.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Remember to Be Safe!  From the Bonnie and Clyde 
Gang.</div></body></html>

                    <html><body>Dear Bonnie andn Clyde gang,<br/>
I have had several encounters with those pesky ground bees at home this summer.  Those stings hurt, swell, and itch for a very LONG time!!  Keep up with the Benedryl and ice and it may help.<br/>
Great to see you again at the fair.  Did you ever find the 2 boxes RTRW and I missed?  When we left Leader of the Pack was going after the kids who planted them...<br/>
