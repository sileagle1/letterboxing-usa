I was thinking of putting one of my special stamps out along the Knobstone<br/>
Trail in Indiana and calling it a Gift for Wanda.  But is that too obvious<br/>
a ploy to have her come and box here?<br/>
<br/>
~speedsquare<br/>
<br/>
BTW - it's a really cool stamp.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We did not find that Wanda and Pete had visited any of the boxes we <br/>
found in New Zealand.  But we have found them everywhere we have <br/>
boxed in the US: all along the eastern coast, and in Arizona and New <br/>
Mexico.  A couple of years ago, we sought out a box in Ft. Myers, FL <br/>
and discovered Wanda and Pete had stamped in to that box three days <br/>
before!  And in Virginia, we had fun finding a box (placed for the <br/>
Northern VA Mystery Gathering) called, "Where's Wanda," which had as <br/>
its stamp a nicely carved image of the lady herself.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite experience of finding a box that they had NOT visited <br/>
was in New Hampshire.  About halfway into the logbook, the placer <br/>
stamped in when doing maintenance on the box.  At the bottom of the <br/>
page was a P.S.:<br/>
<br/>
"Pete and Wanda,where ARE you???"<br/>
<br/>
We did run into Pete on the trail in Mansfield, CT a couple of years <br/>
ago.  But we have not had the pleasure of meeting Wanda yet, <br/>
something we look for to!<br/>
