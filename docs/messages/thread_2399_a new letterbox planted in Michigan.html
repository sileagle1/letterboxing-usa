<br/>From:  Rainbow's End
<br/>Letterbox name:  Beach View by the Dunes Letterbox
<br/>Placed on:  May 20, 2001
<br/>Located at:  Warren Dunes State Park, Sawyer, Michigan, Berrien County
<br/>
<br/>Enter Warren Dunes State Park and take your first right past the guard house 
<br/>toward the campgrounds.  (At the guard house, ask for a Foot Trails map - it 
<br/>can be helpful)  In about 1/4 mile, look for the parking lot for the Nature 
<br/>Trail on your left.  At the end of the parking lot is the trail head for the 
<br/>Nature Trail.  (If you didn't get a map at the guard house, look for one 
<br/>here.)
<br/>
<br/>About 1/2 mile into your walk, there will be two unmarked forks, take the 
<br/>left fork on both.  Then look for a park sign for the Red Squirrel Trail on 
<br/>your left.  Take this trail and continue through the woods on the Red 
<br/>Squirrel Trail.  In about 1/2 mile you will come out of the woods and begin 
<br/>your walk on the magnificent dunes.  Soon the Red Squirrel Trail will 
<br/>dead-end into the Blue Jay Tail.  Turn left and continue toward the lake.  
<br/>Before long you will get a wonderful view of the lake.  Look for the Beach 
<br/>Trail on your left.  Turn left and follow the Beach trail southwest, parallel 
<br/>with the shore on your right.  The first section of the trail stays high on 
<br/>the ridge of the dunes.  It is not well worn here, so watch carefully so you 
<br/>don't stray.  In about 1/4 mile the trail will approach the woods, and turn 
<br/>downhill.  Continue to following the trail downhill along the edge of the 
<br/>woods.  Soon the trail will have descended close to the same level as the 
<br/>shore.  Now look on your left for a metal fence post that is capped with a 
<br/>small pyramid shaped wooden block with a blue DNR label denoting a hiking 
<br/>trail.  Stop here and put your back to the water, looking uphill into the 
<br/>woods.  Just 15 feet in front of you will see an old pine tree who has had a 
<br/>tough life, but managed to stay alive.  This old trunk lays horizontal, with 
<br/>a newer trunk growing from it, upright toward the sun on the right side.  On 
<br/>the left side of the horizontal trunk you will find the letterbox, hidden 
<br/>under the roots and shield by a knurled piece of driftwood.  (Please be sure 
<br/>to replace the driftwood to shield the letterbox)
<br/>
<br/>After completing the letterbox, we recommend continuing southwest along the 
<br/>lake and intersect with the Mt. Randal Trail.  Take this scenic trail inland, 
<br/>back toward the campground and the Nature Trail.  When you get to the Nature 
<br/>Trail, turn right and you will be very close to the parking lot.
<br/>
<br/>We hope you enjoy this special walk!</body></html>
