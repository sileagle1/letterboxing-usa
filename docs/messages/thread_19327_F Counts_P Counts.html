Another letter to add to our PFX counts, an A standing for Assists. Just<br/>
like in the NHL. If you help the planter plant it +1 A, if you adopt a<br/>
letterbox, +1 A, if you plant a box from another state for someone +1 A...<br/>
you get the idea.<br/>

  Subject: [LbNA] Re: Boxes that have since been orphaned<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Shortly after I started letterboxing two years ago, a box in this<br/>
  area lost its stamp to geo-trinkets.  The question was raised on the<br/>
  list as to whether finding the stampless box was an "F" and the FAQ<br/>
  was cited, defining an "F" as being a complete stamp exchange.  So<br/>
  the FAQ may have changed at some point, but it has read this way for<br/>
  the past 2 years.<br/>
<br/>
  But, that was back when I was anal about my numbers.  I think when<br/>
  you are new at something you tend to look for some tangible way to<br/>
  define it and measure your success.  The funny thing is, I ended up<br/>
  adopting this box since it was near my house and the original placer<br/>
  was no longer an active 'boxer.  I carved a new stamp and have since<br/>
  then done maintenance on it.  Not an "F", not a "P", just one of<br/>
  those things you do in the spirit of the game.<br/>
