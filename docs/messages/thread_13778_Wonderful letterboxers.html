people. Last Thurs. after leaving my umbrella behind at a letterbox, I<br/>
get an e-mail from Music Woman that she found it. Not only did she keep<br/>
it for me but today she delivers it to my job on her way to work !! How<br/>
great is this? <br/>
So I got to thinking that maybe we should have a box like the Purple<br/>
Heart but one for people who find (and return) lost items or do other<br/>
good deeds while letterboxing. We could call it the Good Samaritan box.<br/>
Now "IF" I could carve, I'd already have it in the mail to Music Woman,<br/>
but being a total non-carver this is impossible so thanks again to Music<br/>
Woman.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Boy, that's one box that will get around a lot! I think one of the <br/>
unspoken truths about letterboxing is that people will look out for one <br/>
another, take care of someone in need, and generally be alert and <br/>
conscientious of others. If you want to make a stamp for it, well <br/>
that's cool. But I think this trait is pretty much intrinsic in all the <br/>
lboxers I've witnessed via this list, the clues, or in person. In other <br/>
words, we would probably all get the stamp at one point or the other. <br/>
It might just be easier to express this sentiment in our FAQ, but a new <br/>
stamp would be cool too!<br/>
My 2 cents,<br/>
