                    <div class="plaintext-content">Are you a letterboxer with a special interest in New Zealand letterboxing?<br/>
Do you have letterboxes placed here or perhaps intend to come boxing here<br/>
some day? Perhaps you live here already and are just waiting to find out<br/>
where all the clues are? If so, I have set up a yahoo group at<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/nzlb for everything to do with letterboxing<br/>
in New Zealand. I must admit, it's pretty lonely over there at the moment,<br/>
but we have to start somewhere :-)<br/>
<br/>
There are now 14 "public" boxes in NZ (ie boxes with clues publically<br/>
available)  - 8 were placed by tourists from the USA and Canada. We've<br/>
placed 6 (and have 2 more with just clues to finalize - hopefully tonight!).<br/>
Most of our boxes were done in collaboration with our American friends. If<br/>
you like the idea of your boxes heading off to exotic locations, we would<br/>
love to do more collaborations and box-swaps. If you're coming for a visit -<br/>
do get in touch - we'd love to see you.<br/>
<br/>
Wishing you all a boxious day,<br/>
