of what I read in print. However, I would like to write in <br/>
defense of the particular TIME reporters who worked on <br/>
the this article. I have no experience with the stringer <br/>
from the midwest but I did speak with the stringer from <br/>
LA as well as Dierdre vanDyk, the byline reporter. In <br/>
fact I spent the better part of a day in her company along <br/>
with several other esteemed East Coast boxers. <br/>
<br/>
The fellow from California, whose name escapes me at the<br/>
moment was direct and businesslike in his questioning. At<br/>
one point, when I waffled on aswering a question, he told<br/>
me, "Don't say anything you don't want in print. I am a <br/>
journalist, after all." I found this to be much to his credit.<br/>
I was warned and I heeded it. <br/>
<br/>
As for Dierdre, I found her to be quite charming, incredibly<br/>
intelligent, well-read and an enthusiastic letterboxer. She <br/>
had done hours of research on this topic long before she <br/>
met up with any of us. In fact, she was interested in the hobby<br/>
months before she began this article. By the time she had<br/>
stamped into the five letterboxes we found that day and <br/>
exchanged stamps with the rest of us, she was rarin' to go!<br/>
I am very pleased to have her wonderful signature stamp in <br/>
my collection and glad to have her in our ranks.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome, Dierdre! Funhog<br/>
