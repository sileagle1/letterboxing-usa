The Davises wrote such a piece in April 1999.  I think it needs to be<br/>
updated to include other concurrent starts (Waterford EMS (June '98), <br/>
and Tennessee SOS group (Apr '98)), but it is excellent.  Perhaps we will<br/>
find a place to hang it on the web site.  (There was also at least one<br/>
concurrent one day start (Seattle Cachphony Society (May '98), see the<br/>
FAQ for a link.<br/>
<br/>
If someone from these groups groups wishes to add to the piece, let it<br/>
fly :-)<br/>

<br/>
EVERYONE, if there are events you feel would be interesting additions to<br/>
our history piece please let me know via the list.  Please put History<br/>
first in the subject line so I can sort them into a separate file,<br/>
thanks.  I can't promise to use every memory but will attempt to present<br/>
a rounded picture.  We have several "conventions" to remember including<br/>
the first with three people in Seattle having a "pint" in 1998.<br/>
<br/>
Randy, thanks for your input regarding the EMS, etc. pieces.  I will<br/>
contact you directly for more background.  We need to be accurate in<br/>
placing ourselves on the timeline.<br/>

early days prior to the LBNA site and this list. I think it could be <br/>
done in such a way to as to minimize the conflict then (and later on <br/>
for that matter) and emphasize what has become of the hobby in the <br/>
US. As well as I can tell, all of us (the half dozen or so) that <br/>
started talking shortly after the Smithsonian article are all still <br/>
around (with the unfortunate exception of Dan) despite our various <br/>
differences. Anyone heard anything at all from Dan? I think he is the <br/>
only permanent self exile of the early letterboxers.<br/>
