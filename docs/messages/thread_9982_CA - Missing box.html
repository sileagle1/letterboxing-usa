the Fair Oaks box, Sacramento Co. - and it was gone. It would've <br/>

It looks like the work of some neighborhood kids, so we won't be <br/>
replacing the box in the same area. If anyone had a chance to visit <br/>
it during its brief lifetime, I'd be happy to hear about it.<br/>

Not to fear - aside from replanting the Fair Oaks box (in the most <br/>
remote spot we can pick, this time), we've got plans to plant many, <br/>
many more in the area. In fact, we should be placing one in Fairfield <br/>
on Sunday. And I've got a stamp carved for Old Sacramento, so look <br/>
for that one soon. <br/>
<br/>
Boxes are awfully few and far between in this neck of the woods, <br/>
aren't they? We've got a few to find within a reasonable drive, but <br/>
after that, it's going to get pretty boring 'til we visit family in <br/>
Michigan again!<br/>

You live in Davis? Cool! The UCD box is totally unique and a must see. It can take quite some time if you do the whole thing and it's quite tricky in some places but I have to confess, I cheated a little. You see, it was my very first box, I was a total neophyte, and I found a place about 3/4 of the way through the clues that I recognized and went from there. Then, when I got to the end, I was too chicken to get the box! I had to go back a couple days later with my husband to stand guard. You'll understand when you're there.<br/>
<br/>
I'm so looking forward to some new boxes close to home! I'll be scouring the listings!<br/>
