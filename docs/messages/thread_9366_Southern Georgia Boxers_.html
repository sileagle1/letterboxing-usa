<br/>
I just got into this whole thing, but I'm definitely willing to <br/>
travel to find some boxes in Southern Georgia.  <br/>
<br/>
We live in Pensacola, FL and we're just about to plant our first of <br/>
several boxes here.  <br/>
<br/>
Keep us updated!<br/>

We are in Gainesville, Florida, and we noticed there are not that many in this area either.Â  We are hoping to plant a few too, and we would definitely travel to the Valdosta area to find boxes.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

   My parents live in Waycross and just started letterboxing a few <br/>
months ago while in vacation up in W.Virginia.  I'm sure they would <br/>
be interested in the 1 hour drive to Valdosta to get some LBs!  Also, <br/>
they are "planning" on planting one near them in the Okeefenokee <br/>
Swamp Park.  If they get around to it, I'll make sure they post the <br/>
directions here.  DH and I will be going to visit them for Christmas <br/>
and may offer to "help" with the planting to get things moving! ;-)  <br/>
For their sake your daughter's situation sounds wonderful!  (I have <br/>
to admit, I wouldn't mind getting over there on one of our visits and <br/>
collecting some myself!)  BTW, what brought your daughter down to <br/>
Valdosta?<br/>

Have you ever been jilted in Georgia?<br/>
Have you ever been jilted at all?<br/>
How could she not remember the moss at the waterfall?<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever been wasted in Waycross<br/>
And vowed to never grow old?<br/>
How could she not remember the thimbles of shimmering gold?<br/>
