The town is well-known for its woolen mill, where gorgeous blankets are woven. Visitors can tour the mill, <br/>
take a fascinating Underground Tour of gold rush era buildings and go to the Tamastlikt Cultural Institute, <br/>
a world-class Native American museum. Every September, the town's population swells with colorful <br/>
cowboys, indians in full regalia, horses, mules, oxen, and thousands of fans of the world famous <br/>
Pendleton Round-Up, the largest four day rodeo in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: Park at SW 12th and Court in downtown Pendleton. This a short walk on a paved, level <br/>
pathway.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: Beneath the trees you will find Roy's Rock, lava and leaves at its back. Pass beyond the <br/>
backdrop and continue onward over verge, beneath limbs to the levee's top. An asphalt path will guide you <br/>
in the direction of the setting sun past slats and timbers, seating to the left. The bucks don't stop here <br/>
and happiness resides. Walk until you reach the point where Bedford's arch invites you to pass over to <br/>
the Halls of Academe. Move a stone between boulder and concrete, the rising sun at your back. Let 'er <br/>
Buck!<br/>

I cant believe you beat me to it. I was just up in Pendleton, visiting my <br/>
dad and helping him set up lights for happy canyon before round up started <br/>
and thinking "Gee, i should put a letterbox out here, no one else has."<br/>
<br/>
Darn you and your mind reading ways! ;-)<br/>
