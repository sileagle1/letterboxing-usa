                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, okay, so I guess my letterboxes are a tiny bit off the beaten <br/>
path, but this is not the Donner Party trail!!  I'm going to re-carve <br/>
my Coyote Canyon stamp to include a rattler image (don't tread on <br/>
me).  Many thanks to Denise for letting me know about the serpent <br/>
hazard, and I included this warning on my LBNA posting (I'm not <br/>
joking here).  Now for all you thrillseeker letterboxers, grab a <br/>
snakebite kit and travel into the unknown reaches of Eaton Canyon.  <br/>
If these reaches are so unknown, how come I was caught red-handed <br/>
planting the Coyote Canyon LB by some lone girl, walking by herself, <br/>
deep in the canyon, a few minutes before sunset.  She saw me up on <br/>
the hill overlooking the path and said, "What are you doing?, I see <br/>
you're wearing a glove, are you collecting botanical specimens?"  For <br/>
a split second, my mind fumbled with plausible lie after lie, then I <br/>
said, "I'm planting a letterbox."  After this were many minutes of <br/>
explanation followed by our mutual trip back down the canyon before <br/>
nightfall, thereby avoiding a $150 dollar fine for being in the park <br/>
after dark.<br/>

&gt; Just wanted to report my adventures finding some boxes in "not-so-<br/>
&gt; sunny" california. LOL!  My job allows for a LOT of travel, so <br/>
&gt; letterboxing and geocaching are great activities to keep one out of <br/>
&gt; the hotel room!<br/>
&gt; I located the Meadow Box (placed by Buzzard) with no problems.  the <br/>
&gt; scenery was great.  This was my first trip to California and for <br/>
some <br/>
&gt; reason i kept humming the theme song to M*A*S*H!  So after a <br/>
&gt; successful find, my buddy and i decided to locate the Coyote Canyon <br/>
&gt; box....well, without making a story to long, i was not able to <br/>
reach <br/>
&gt; the box because a rattle snake was blocking my trail!  WHOA! what a <br/>
&gt; surprize (and a beautiful snake too!).  however, his rattle shook <br/>
up <br/>
&gt; my midwestern bones too much to venture any further in the <br/>
&gt; wilderness, so i called it a day.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; any suggestions for boxes near Dover, DE?  or Springfield, Il?<br/>
