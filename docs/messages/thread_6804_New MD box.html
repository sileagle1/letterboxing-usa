Elkridge, MD<br/>
Easy <br/>

Hopefully you have found the Cascades letterbox before you find this one.  If not, go find it after!<br/>
<br/>
The park is located off of Route 1 in Elkridge, MD.  This is a beautiful park with lots of trails and gorgeous scenery!<br/>
<br/>
Enter the park and pay the $2.00 entrance fee.  If you would like a trail map of the park, purchase one from the attendant at the booth for $3.00.  (I personally feel like it's worth the price!)<br/>
<br/>
Find the Lost Lake and park.  Follow the Grist Mill Trail.  You will come to the Swinging Bridge - great to bounce on!  If you plan on finding the Cascades box, you would cross the bridge and continue from there.  For this box however, continue past the Swinging Bridge, staying on the Grist Mill Trail and following the grey blazes.  The trail is paved until you get to the bridge, then it becomes rocky (small rocks!)  Then you end up walking on a huge cement drainage pipe. (Yes, it is really part of the trail!)  It would be possible to bike most of this trail, but you might want to walk your bike across the drainage pipe!  <br/>
After you get off of the drainage pipe, continue to follow the trail until you get to a tunnel going under the railroad tracks.  There is a small stream flowing through the tunnel.  Splash if you care to!  Go through the tunnel, step over the stream and make an immediate left as you come out of the tunnel.  You will see a large downed tree.  In the center of this tree there is a small live tree growing out of the dead one.  It has a vine wrapped around it like candy cane stripes.  At the base of this small tree, next to the dead tree, you will find a letterbox hidden under rocks and pieces of railroad ties!<br/>
<br/>
Did you find Cascades yet?!<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

Placed October 22, 2002<br/>
By Firefly<br/>
Savage Mill Park<br/>
Savage Mill, MD<br/>
Howard County<br/>
Difficulty: easy 1-2 mile hike.  Please note that the trail can be a little rough in places.  Watch your step!<br/>
<br/>
Benjamin was upset.  He could not convince the others that they had made a mistake.  They had chosen that "other bird" to represent the country.  That bird was bald!  His bird was beautiful, big, and covered with feathers.   He was so frustrated he decided to take a stroll through the woods to burn off some steam.<br/>
<br/>
Ben hopped on his horse, Lighting Bolt,  and headed to the corners of Baltimore Street and Fair Street in Savage Mill where he found the entrance to the Savage Mill Park.  He rode his horse up the main road where he stayed to the right at the split.  Then he followed the road as it turned left and then right into the farthest horse parking lot.  There was a sports field on his right and woods on his left.  After tying up Lighting Bolt, Ben noticed a trail leading from the far left corner of the parking lot into the woods.  <br/>
<br/>
Ben followed the paved trail into the woods.  Soon he came to a split in the trail.  He ignored the trail to the right and stayed straight ahead.  Before he knew it, the paved trail was ending.  Luckily, he noticed a gravel/dirt trail sneeking in from the left.  He headed down the hill watching his footing carefully.<br/>
<br/>
At the bottom of thie hill he could hear the river flowing.  He decided to turn right so he could walk along the river.<br/>
<br/>
A brown post appeared on his right.  He bent down to read the scratchy gold square attached to the post.  "Douglas Freiland's Eagle Scout Project"  Unfortunately, the top of the post was bare.  Benjamin pondered what Mr. Freiland's project might have been.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing on the trail, Ben crossed a little wooden boardwalk.  At the bottom of the slope, he turned right and ignored the faint trail coming in from the left.  He was getting a little tired so he took a moment to sit on the wooden bench that he discovered on the trail.  What a peaceful place.  Here he could see the river more clearly.  It was a beautiful place to rest.<br/>
<br/>
As he sat to rest, he thought he heard a strange noise coming from somewhere in the distance.  What was making that noise?  He had to find out.  He headed back on the trail where soon he passed a few more of Mr. Freiland's posts.  <br/>
<br/>
The trail came to a split again.  Almost a clearing.  Benjamin could still hear the strange noise coming from his right.  He walked past a large boulder, away from the river and soon found yet one more of the ubiquitous brown posts on his left.<br/>
<br/>
There were two downed trees crossing the trail.  He hopped over the trees and felt the need to begin counting his steps.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10!  Off in the distance, at a bearing of 130 degrees, Benjamin saw a tree that had splintered in half.  The strange "gobble, gobble" noise got stronger as he approached the tree.  AHA!  It was his favorite bird.  The true National Bird!<br/>
<br/>
After giving his friend a pat on the head, Ben noticed a paved trail up the hill from the splinter tree.  He turned right on this trail and followed it back to his horse.<br/>

What you don't know is that after our Squirrels girls party, we saw a <br/>

<br/>
Froggie and Robyn's love child will hop into the park on Saturday, so <br/>
be looking for it early next week. (The ADG is planning a big boxing <br/>
day at Patapsco on Sunday, i'm so excited!)<br/>
