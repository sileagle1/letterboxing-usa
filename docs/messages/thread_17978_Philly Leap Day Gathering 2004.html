<br/>
We had a wonderful time at the Philly Leap Day<br/>
Gathering, and would like to thank everyone who<br/>
organized this event and those who obviously worked so<br/>
very hard at making it a memorable experience.<br/>
<br/>
It was also a delight to discover such a lovely park,<br/>
located less than 60 miles from my house. And now I<br/>
find that it's got eight letterboxes scattered about<br/>
it?! (Of which Geko and myself were only able to find<br/>
the time to acquire two.)<br/>
<br/>
But most of all, it was great to be able to place so<br/>
many Faces to all these ListNames and Stamp Images -<br/>
and see firsthand the excuberance of letterboxing on<br/>
both young and old.<br/>
<br/>
If Geko and Myself met you at the Gathering ... it was<br/>
great meeting you (again), and we hope to meet you yet<br/>
again soon.<br/>
<br/>
If, however - you or we were too busy, out on the<br/>
trail, leaving early to have stamped our book ... I'm<br/>
sure we'll see you at the next Area Gathering - as<br/>
these are WAY too much fun to skip.<br/>
