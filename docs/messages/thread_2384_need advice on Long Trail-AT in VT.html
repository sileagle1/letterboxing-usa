                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry, Roseann, but I've never been on the AT/Long Trail in that <br/>
area.  My experience of the AT in New England and the Long Trail in <br/>
Vermont has been quite limited.  My goal for hiking the AT has been <br/>
to hike some in every state that it traverses, and that's been fairly <br/>
recently realized.<br/>
     I'd suggest you access the AT and Long Trail websites for <br/>
guidance (both to be found thru Google, I think).  Have a good <br/>
vacation, and do look for those letterboxes near the junction of <br/>
those two trails just north of US 4 east of Rutland.  That's <br/>
certainly rewarding, and requires some hiking, too.<br/>

You can find a lot of good information here <br/>
http://www.greenmountainclub.org<br/>
<br/>
I've just recently added the GMC Long Trail Guide and Day Hiker's <br/>
Guide to Vermont to my trail guidebook collection.  The LTG divides <br/>
the trail into Divisions.  The area you'll be in is Division 5, which <br/>
appears to include a selection of hikes of varying degrees of <br/>
difficulty and length....all describing good views from rocky cliffs <br/>
and Shrewsbury, Pico and Killington Peaks.<br/>
<br/>
Although I can't offer you firsthand information, these guides and <br/>
accompanying maps are enough to whet the appetite for someday <br/>
experiencing "the real thing".<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck and have a great vacation!<br/>

<div>Yes Roseann! At Sherburne Pass is where the AT and LT part 
ways which is right along route 4 not far from Pico Mountain (ski resort area) 
The trailhead to the AT/LT junction is right next to McGrath's Irish pub (former 
site of a letterbox and also site of the first LBNA gathering). There is a loop 
that you can take that will pass you by Deer Leap which has an awesome view of 
Pico/Killington and the valley below. When you arrive at the junction, you'll 
come upon a signpost with a map of the loop trail which will guide you along 
your way. Oh, and by the way, there are a BUNCH of letterboxes in that 
area!</div>
