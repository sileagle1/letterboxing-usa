doesn't wash for anyone who travels at all to find <br/>
letterboxes. People don't buy a GPS because they're scared <br/>
of the technology or just not interested in it,not because <br/>
they can't afford it."   -- Kirbert<br/>

I'm sorry, but how pompous can you be? I have been boxing <br/>
for four years, and one of the things that drew me to the <br/>
hobby was the relatively low to no cost factor of it. As a <br/>
single parent I am on an extremely tight budget. Would I <br/>
drive to Maine or "travel at all to find letterboxes" Of <br/>
course, and quite enjoy doing so. That by no means implies <br/>
that I can afford a gps because I may choose to spend $30 <br/>
in gas to go boxing further away and have memorable times <br/>
and hikes and vistas. And no, I am not afraid of <br/>
technology. Your sweeping generalizations do nothing to <br/>
plead your case<br/>

I do both.  They are both fun and they are as different as <br/>
Time and Newsweek.<br/>
