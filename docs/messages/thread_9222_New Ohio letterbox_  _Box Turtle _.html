website? Thanks!  Name: "Box Turtle". Location: Chillicothe, Ohio.<br/>
(Ross County). Placed 11-17-02 by Salamander. Difficulty: <br/>
Moderate.    This letterbox is located near the Chillicothe <br/>
Pedestrian/Bikeway Corridor. Parking is in the lot just south of the <br/>
intersection of Rts. 104 and 35, on Rt.104.  CLUES: From the parking <br/>
lot, proceed along the paved walkway until you come to a stairway <br/>
leading down to another parking area. Starting from a point in the <br/>
middle of the walkway, just opposite the top of the stairway, you <br/>
will need to start counting your paces as you continue along in the <br/>
direction you have been going. Go for 18 paces.  Stop. Then walk 7 <br/>
paces toward the wooded area to your left. You will need to take <br/>
these 7 paces in a straight line exactly perpendicular to the walkway <br/>
at that point. Stop. From this spot, you can find the letterbox at a <br/>
heading of 75 degrees, hidden under some old railroad ties and <br/>
leaves. HINT: As you approach the ties, you will want to concentrate <br/>
your search to the left, not the right. <br/>
