WA.  Wonderful boxes in Tolmie, Woodard Bay, Olympia and the Olympia <br/>
Watershed Park.<br/>
<br/>
Also the "worlds most boring" LB in Lacey.  Blah Blah Blah :-)<br/>
<br/>
The Nail Family and DVN2R SKR have done a great job at placing boxes <br/>
with good, sometimes challenging, clues.  The parks are all beauties <br/>
( except perhaps that blah blah blah place which can be said to be a <br/>
pretty little gem) with Tolmie SP presenting a good and hefty hike <br/>
when both boxes are tackled back to back.<br/>
<br/>
I gave an info sheet to a family who passed by when I was stamping <br/>
in.  I think the two young boys would love this activity.  Many Wooly <br/>
Bears seen including some young ones.  Douglas Squirrels are hard at <br/>
it getting ready for Winter.  Mushroom Lovers are in heaven right now <br/>
with varied colorful species all over the place.<br/>
<br/>
I picked up Ocean Sunrise HH and will place it again by next weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone had a great Fall weekend out and about.<br/>
