More Letterbox maintenance in the Pacific Northwest.  The First <br/>
Halloween letterbox (Ghostie) had been missing and the original <br/>
hiding place was dug up, so I have moved "Ghostie" down the trail a <br/>
bit to a better location.  The clues are the same except for <br/>
#1, "Ghostie".<br/>

Issaquah, King County, Washington<br/>

The Red Town Trailhead, is also the site of a former mining town.  In <br/>
1883, the town had 750 residents and produced coal for steamships, <br/>
railroads and the city of San Francisco.  Prospectors and coal miners <br/>
worked Cougar Mountain for nearly 100 years, digging coal, waste rock <br/>
and clay.  The town was called "Red Town" because  the houses were <br/>
all painted the same shade of red.  I chose this "ghost town" for my <br/>
Halloween letterboxes.<br/>

A moderately easy hike, approximately 2-2.5 mile loop.<br/>
<br/>
Driving Directions: From I-90:<br/>
Take exit 13 and drive west on Newport Way to 164th Avenue <br/>
Southeast.  Turn South onto 164th and climb the hill 1.7 miles to the <br/>
Lakemont Boulevard junction.   Turn Right onto Lakemont Boulevard and <br/>
follow it for 1.4 miles.  Look for the Red Town Trailhead on the left <br/>
side of the road.<br/>
