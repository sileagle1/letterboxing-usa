                    <div class="plaintext-content">     Sue and I want to thank all of you who made this day really <br/>
special! [May the gerbil rest in peace!] All of your hard work and <br/>
planning really paid off! We had a chance to renew some old <br/>
friendships and make many new ones! Sue and I spread over 3 yards of <br/>
mulch yesterday and almost skipped the event due to sore muscles. <br/>
Once we started stamping in, we both forgot about the aches and pains!<br/>
We are so glad we made it.<br/>
<br/>
     Besides the wonderful event stamp, "table o' hitchhikers," <br/>
Presidents, Birthday, Red Sky, Mystery and other boxes, Sue and I <br/>
came across some really special hitchhikers. Watch our website for <br/>
the details in the next few days - Brian [TeamGreenDragon]- you are <br/>
going to flip when you see what we found!! That will teach you to run <br/>
off to the Dancing Men!<br/>
<br/>
     Enjoyed meeting Beth, Rubaduc, The Engraver [The Garden was <br/>
terrific!!], Sunshine &amp; Swamp Yankee, Poppins, SLR in RI and others. <br/>
Group letterboxing adds a whole new dimension to this hobby and we <br/>
thank our partners in crime: TeamGreenDragon, MusicWoman, Sunshine &amp; <br/>
Swamp Yankee, Poppins, SLR in RI and Samantha. Beth is so correct <br/>
when she says how amazing it is that after spending a day with <br/>
strangers, you leave feeling like family. This is quite a <br/>
community of people!!<br/>
