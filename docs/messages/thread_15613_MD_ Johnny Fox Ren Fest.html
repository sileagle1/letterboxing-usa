Johnny Fox, sword swallower extraordinaire, has been entertaining at <br/>
the MD Ren Fest for over 20 years. The first time I saw his show I <br/>
was so shocked, I laughed so hard I cried and I hurt. "Water from <br/>
India," protects him from harm. I'll let you figure out whether he <br/>
really swallows the swords or not. <br/>
<br/>
After the show buy some snacks from Johnny Fox's Almonds booth. Then <br/>
turn left past the School of Juggling and find an interesting triple <br/>
tree with a trunk smaller than the other two. Behind it is a zig zag <br/>
path going down the hill. Halfway down find a long curved bench. <br/>
Count 4 support posts from right to left and sit down next to the 4th <br/>
one. Reach under the bench and between the supports for what you seek.<br/>
