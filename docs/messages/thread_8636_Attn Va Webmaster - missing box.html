I don't know how it went missing but since its hiding spot under a <br/>
heavy slab of concrete and not facing any trail, the most likely <br/>
possibility is that a letterboxer's activities were observed.  This <br/>
reminds us that we need to be Invisible Letterboxers at these crowded <br/>
parks.  I've been known to do the Happy Dance when I found a box.  <br/>
I've got to cut that out.<br/>

I was just at the park on 10/13 and the box was there.  It was <br/>
raining and there were only a couple people at the dog park, so I <br/>
don't think anyone saw me take or replace it.  And there was no happy <br/>
dancing involved, so I know I didn't draw attention to myself.  I <br/>
even lifted up the concrete a bit when I put it back to make sure it <br/>
was hidden!  It looks like that might be a "party" area for kids, <br/>
from some of the trash that was about. <br/>
Sorry about the box.  Liked the series though.  Yep, I got all 3.<br/>
