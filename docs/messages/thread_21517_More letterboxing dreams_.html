Just thought I would share ... I had a second letterboxing dream last night ... dreamt I was <br/>
at a student art show and among the many displayed artworks was an unusual box and a <br/>
stamped image.  I recognized "the placer's" sig stamp.  I was terribly excited, and <br/>
depressed ... no one told me I would need to carry my letterboxing supplies with me for <br/>
the event!  Why wasn't it posted to the LBNA or AQ websites, even earlier that morning (I <br/>
check these lists daily)?  Do I pick it up, take it away and return with it stamped?  Then I <br/>
woke up!  Dream or nightmare?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I've already got a stamp image "Only in My Dreams" for my first dream/nightmare.  I <br/>
guess I better start a series.  And whose sig stamp was featured in my dream?  Stay tuned.<br/>
<br/>
Please don't tell me I have too much time on my hands, and just get out and box.  I have <br/>
been doing that.  I JUST LOVE LETTERBOXING!<br/>
