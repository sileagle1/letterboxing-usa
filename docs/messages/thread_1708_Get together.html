I have the following ideas how about some feedback.<br/>
<br/>
We could meet about 12 near the Uconn campus there is an ice cream <br/>
shop with a great rubber stamp shop on the side. We could get out <br/>
local maps and there are plenty of boxes within an easy drive. Most <br/>
are very kid friendly. After an afternoon of  boxing we could meet <br/>
together at the county fairgrounds in Vernon. I have the main <br/>
building on hold for the day in case others have  different time <br/>
schedule in mind.  Since we can't box all day and then cook or <br/>
potluck we could A. have a simple Ziti &amp; bread catered<br/>
B. go to very nearby fastfood and come back for ice cream and cookies <br/>
everyone brings some.<br/>
C. We could have some members/friends offer to cook for the group <br/>
there is a kitchen there. <br/>
   Well please reply what you think and how many think they might be <br/>
available. We  don't need to worry we can do others too. Or we could <br/>
do a later date. Our 4-H club may do a special in conjunction with <br/>
our county fair in August. Same location. Please reply   carol<br/>

I can attend and would be very willing to do C. I have experience<br/>
making large amounts of soup, etc. in a restaurant setting,<br/>
especially vegeterian dishes.  Corn chowder or Native American corn<br/>
and potato are easy and go over well.  If someone would bring bread<br/>
we could also do sandwiches or something. I just need to know what<br/>
people will eat and how many.<br/>

Count Dan &amp; I in!!  We can bring whatever you need for food or drinks.  Just<br/>
a warning, we are not very good cooks, so anything that you might need to go<br/>
with the meal would probably be best.  Just let us know what you need!<br/>
Can't wait for the 28th!<br/>

   Count my daughter (Shelley, 9 yrs old) and I in for the 28th!  <br/>
Sounds like fun.  We haven't had a chance to get out to Mansfield to <br/>
hunt for any of your boxes yet (we've only done 4, but we're working <br/>
on it!!)  The get together sounds like a perfect day.<br/>
    Just a thought on the food - if there are going to be a lot of <br/>
kids are they going to be keen on soup?  But I am no cook, so can't <br/>
really offer any other suggestions (besides fast food!!!).  I'll keep <br/>
my eye on the list if you come up with any other ways you need people <br/>
to help.<br/>
    I love the idea of a stamp carving contest (for the kids at <br/>
least!)  Hopefully we'll have time to get to work on one!!!<br/>

    We have done large-group picnics and have had great success by having<br/>
everyone pack their own meal, plates, etc. but bring a dessert and/or salad<br/>
to share.  The beauty of this plan is that if the guy signed up to bring the<br/>
hamburger rolls doesn't show up for whatever reason, the show still goes on.<br/>
You know what your family will or will not eat, and you don't need a firm<br/>
head count.  Just a suggestion.  (Although soup sounds great to me!)  It's<br/>
looking like Kathryn and I may have to pass on the get-together due to a<br/>
volleyball tournament, but I'm not giving up hope completely.  Will let you<br/>
know as soon as I have the official schedule.  Ann T.<br/>

Something else you could consider is pasta.  You could have crockpots <br/>
simmering with meatballs, sausage and/or chunky veggie sauce during <br/>
the day.  Fill the pasta pots of full of water before you go out <br/>
letting them come to room temp to save heating time later.  Then add <br/>
prepackaged salad and bread and you have a meal most will enjoy <br/>
without too much effort on anyone's part.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You can count on me and my mom, and hopefully one or two more. (Are we<br/>
going to allow dogs?) My vote goes to everyone bringing their own<br/>
sandwiches or fast food, and enjoying hot soup as offered by others and<br/>
all bringing a dessert to share. (is there going to be ref. available to<br/>
put icecream or toppings in?) My mom likes the idea since some people<br/>
are veg. heads or vegan heads. I think we need to do some kind of list<br/>
so that we know how many people are going, contest ideas, and who's<br/>
bringing what. If carol hasn't already done it I'll volunteer, as I have<br/>
much experience throwing dances and events together. <br/>
<br/>
My mom has this interesting idea. Instead of name tags, or on name tags,<br/>
we place our individual stamps and pin them on. Then we can put a face,<br/>
with an e-mail, with a stamp.<br/>
<br/>
In the course of writing the last sentence my mom asked me twice to ask<br/>
for directions and if anyone can scan a map to show where this place is.<br/>
I live about 45 minuted away and work in mansfield and still have never<br/>
been to UConn. (Sorry not a basketball fan.) Please reply if you can get<br/>
a map into an e-mail. (otherwise I'll have to go to yahoo, but I need a<br/>
street address to enter.)<br/>

Yes, we too look forward to attending the gathering and meeting some <br/>
of our fellow 'boxers.<br/>

My vote is also to "bring your own food" and a something extra for <br/>
the group. However, if we opt not to go this route, I can bring a <br/>
large fresh veggie platter with spinach dip.<br/>

See y'all on the 28th (weather permitting)!<br/>
