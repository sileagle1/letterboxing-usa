I'm not speaking from experience - just a suggestion.  I started <br/>
using SuperGlue for mounting stamps - quick (like instant) and unless <br/>
it cracks in the cold I would guess permanent.  Although I use foam <br/>
core it should still work on plexi.  FIRST stamp your image on paper <br/>
(I prefer card stock, index card) so you can outline the finished <br/>
stamp incase the image is not even with the edges.  Then glue the <br/>
stamp to the plexi.  Then cut the image to the stamp edges and glue <br/>
it to the top of the plexi exactly over the stamp.  I always cover <br/>
anything paper (log,FFC,foamcore) with the wide clear packaging tape -<br/>
 even if has to be lap seamed.  It keeps the paper 'clean' and adds <br/>
support.  Just extend it over the plexi - might help with any rough <br/>
edges.<br/>

Hi Music Woman,<br/>
I've never used Plexi for mounting, but here is a tip for PZKut. If <br/>
you scrub the mounting side of PZ Kut with a wetted(with acetone) <br/>
paper towel you will find that it accepts adhesive much better. I <br/>
use Household Goop( very similar to Shoe Goo)when I mount my stamps <br/>
to wood. The problem I think you will find will be the clarity <br/>
required to get a good image through the plexi and glue. Your idea <br/>
sounds pretty cool but finding a good adhesive that has clarity and <br/>
good sticking power will be your biggest hurdle. Please let us know <br/>
if your concept works as I intend to use it if it does.<br/>
<br/>

I've had my sig stamp, carved from MasterCarve though, on a piece of<br/>
Plexi for over 2 years now.  I glued it with a regular hot glue gun<br/>
and in the 2+ years of gatherings, exchanges and stamping into boxes<br/>
I've only had to re-glue it ONCE.  It makes a nice base for pressing.<br/>
 My husband used a dremmel to cut the piece to fit my stamp and it<br/>
fits perfectly.<br/>

Glue the image to the back of your stamp. Wait to dry. Glue the<br/>
plexiglass to the image, making sure to press hard so all the bubbles<br/>
come out. Wait to dry. Voila.<br/>

I think I used this stuff to glue my pink eraser stamp to its wooden<br/>

totally remember.<br/>

There are a lot of nice suggestions here.  One thing I have found is <br/>
that when I am mounting a stamp, I need to be careful.  I live in a <br/>
cold mountain state and I used to use superglue to mount till I found <br/>
that it can shatter like glass when temperatures go around freezing.  <br/>
I have since found that contact cement-or rubber cement-works well <br/>
for me.  I put some on where I outlined the stamp before and then <br/>
coat the back of the stamp itself.  Let both dry then apply together <br/>
and you will have a fast, strong bond that lasts in variable weather.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what effect it will have to glue a paper between the two <br/>
things.  I imagine it might weaken it.  If you were really determined <br/>
you could try a couple of pieces of plexiglass attached with the <br/>
image between and the stamp under that.  I don't think I'm that <br/>
determined.  One other option might be to use some of those newer <br/>
inks that are made to work on variable surfaces.  I did a Christmas <br/>
project where I stamped some tiles with that special ink (it works on <br/>
glass, ceramic, wood, etc) and put something under to keep from <br/>
scratching and they made some nifty coasters tied up with a nice <br/>
ribbon.  The ink took a bit longer to dry, but it has stayed on <br/>
well.  I'll bet that would work well on plexiglass if you want to <br/>
stamp the image on like you would on wood.  Just a thought!<br/>

We have Secret Stamping Sisters at a local stamp store (;-) for those who live near me know what store I talk about) and I carved a stamp as a present for my secret stamping sister.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for the great imput!  I used the E6000 from Michaels crafts, and though it smells to the high heavens, it works GREAT!  Thank goodness the smell goes away when it dries!<br/>
