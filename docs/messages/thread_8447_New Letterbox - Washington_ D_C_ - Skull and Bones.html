  A long time ago, the storyteller quipped,<br/>
  A person was killed for letting secrets slip<br/>
  Way down at the Mall in the heart of D.C.<br/>
  The most overlooked monument is the one to see<br/>
  At the southern end lies the box and tome<br/>
  Between the obelisk and Abraham's stone.<br/>
  Find the white marble disk with roof under the sun<br/>
  A tribute for those who died in World War One<br/>
  Their homes all lay in the District's lap<br/>
  This names inscribed with a sculpter's tap<br/>
  Stand in the center, with North to your eye<br/>
  Compass in hand and ready to try.<br/>
   At 345 you will see<br/>
   A very old and colorful tree<br/>
   Walk this way to its base<br/>
   At 315 is another face<br/>
   Rather, a tree is what you see<br/>
   It has a tag with an I 433.<br/>
   See the bushes off to the right<br/>
   With a large opening (maybe need a miner's light?)<br/>
   Crawl right in to the central part<br/>
   The box is there...be still, beating heart<br/>
    Under a small log the box doth rest<br/>
    And so you will complete your quest<br/>

Cool!  HH 13 is off to VA or somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised you were able to find such a good LBox hiding place <br/>
right in the midst of things there.  I hope you got my draft for a <br/>
Micro box in DC.  If anyone in DC wants to test out "Egypt" let me <br/>
know and I'll email it to you.<br/>
