&gt; this box?  =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>

<br/>
Some folks would donate kidneys if they were REALLY sincere. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, it will take a bit of time before that firefighter/EMT box <br/>
is in place at the Grover Beach Fire Department. Lance is convinced <br/>
that he wants a laser-cut stamp. I think I will work on him to let <br/>
JugglerMouse carve it instead. That should hurry things up.<br/>
<br/>
And if one were to go to the SLO Beauty College and ask for a <br/>
manicure, pedicure, or something done to one's hair from Ashley <br/>
Weaver, she has a stamp on her for such occasions. Okay, you do not <br/>
necessarily have to get any beauty treatments but they are very <br/>
reasonable (and well supervised.) No, she did not cut my hair.<br/>
<br/>
Better pic of JugglerMouse and the thinner me now up at the photos of <br/>
the October 4th event.<br/>
