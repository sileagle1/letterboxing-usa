I just took a cyber-trip to Kirwin Lake Kansas - thanks for including<br/>
the stamps, and, BTW, design and craving job! You have a nice,<br/>
consistant style to your work, very clean, direct and bold. Keep it up.<br/>
<br/>
These are carved from red rubber? With X-acto blades or Speedball<br/>
cutters?<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone out there tried a Dremel tool for stamp carving? if so, what<br/>
did you use for a cutting nib?<br/>

You know me... always the purist.  I've played around with other tools, and<br/>
mediums, but I always go back to my trusty Pink Pearl erasers and a simple $2<br/>
X-acto knife.<br/>
<br/>
I like red rubber because it's firm.  When I go back to vinyl, it feels like<br/>
I'm cutting jello.  Rubber resists a little, which (for me) seems to result in<br/>
better control of the knife.  It also allows me to carve fine details that<br/>
would break off if done in vinyl.  <br/>
<br/>
Some stamps I've made in the past took days to complete, but for letterboxes I<br/>
must admit that I try to keep it simple.  Most have taken well under an hour<br/>
to carve.  That way I won't be completely crushed if one of them comes up<br/>
missing... easy come, easy go.  I'll just whip up a new one and try a better<br/>
hiding place.  Better to devote my time to setting out as many boxes as I can,<br/>
rather than dote forever on one masterpiece stamp, only to have it stolen as<br/>
soon as I set it out.<br/>
<br/>
My early stamps were small and carved in a single Pink Pearl (or sometimes a<br/>
white vinyl eraser).  Lately, I've been carving my title and date on one<br/>
eraser, and the graphics on another.  Then I arrange them on a thin block of<br/>
wood using rubber cement to make a nice sized stamp.  By the way, I have<br/>
purposefully altered the scale of my online stamp images, so that a<br/>
counterfeit print made off the website will not turn out the same size as an<br/>
original print.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your positive comments on the Kansas stamps.  I carved them while<br/>
sitting around with family, and then my parents and my nephew all went out and<br/>
helped me hide them.  It added a bit of interest to our holiday, and was fun<br/>
for everyone... my 3 year old nephew is still convinced that a bear was hiding<br/>
in the hollow tree that I hid the Wheat Head box inside!!<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Love,<br/>
