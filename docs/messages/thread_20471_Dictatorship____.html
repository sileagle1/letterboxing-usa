What makes you feel that this list is a dictatorship!?!? Far from it <br/>
actually!  As list manager, Randy is very "hands off" and lets the <br/>
masses have their discussions. As moderators, we live with that <br/>
policy and carry out his wishes.   As people, we (Heidi and Steve) <br/>
don't bring bad blood to this board. <br/>
<br/>
We may have some differences in opinions, but thats besides the <br/>
point. If we don't happen to be a fan of yous, we'll just not go <br/>
boxing with you! Plain and simple....<br/>
<br/>
As far as this being a dictatorship, if you really feel that way then <br/>
perhaps it may have been better to send a note to Randy or the <br/>
moderators before addressing it on the list. <br/>
<br/>
That being said... It is indeed sad that Rayvenhaus's website was <br/>
vandalized.  As far as competition with letterboxing.org; how can you <br/>
compete with something that is non-profit, free to all, and open <br/>
access to all?? <br/>

Something most of you have no way of knowing: <br/>
<br/>
the Webmasters get lots of Virus Intercepted messages, sometimes 20-30 a day.  The site is particularly well maintained.  We are very fortunate that the original website design was strong and the ongoing management works hard at keeping it safe and improving the protections.  I don't think anyone has time or animosity to spend on aggression, the web is jungle enough.<br/>
<br/>
This site is a labor of love,  those who put the incredible effort into maintaining the site have too much empathy for someone else's work  to wantonly attack them.  There is no economic, moral, political, or practical reason to do so.  <br/>
<br/>
Please, all take a long breath and wish Rayvenhaus well, as I do.<br/>
<br/>
