Box:  Lion's Den
<br/>Location:  Burger's Zoo
<br/>Arnhem, The Netherlands
<br/>Directions:  The Zoo can be reached by car or rail
<br/>By rail:  The Arnhem Station then trolley bus 3.
<br/>Planted by:  Muk-Luk and Dutch Relatives  5/01
</p><p>Clues:
<br/>Begin your journey in the bush (hunters who wear glasses should scout
out the gray elephant at the entrance of the bush to prepare their glasses
for the environment).  While in the bush enjoy the waterfall and the
rope and plank crossing.
</p><p>Explore the deep regions of the ocean soaking up the water before heading
into the desert.
</p><p>Return to the outside and visit with the creatures both large and small.
</p><p>When you are ready to locate the box find your way to the Walking Safari. 
On a hot day you will enjoy strolling under the covered walkway. 
Shortly again you will be without cover and wander down the path until
you come to a lovely view of a pond.  Stay awhile and enjoy the feathered
friends.  When your visit is over continue on the path where you will
pass through a large metal gate.  The path will wind to the right. 
There you will spot a tree at the immediate corner on the outside of the
wooden path guiderail to you right.  From that tree take a reading
148*.  This will lead you to the backside of the Lion's viewing bridge.
</p><p>You should find the box in front of a door that has a tiny bridge leading
to it.  Standing on the bridge with the door facing you look down
and to the left.  The treasure you seek is tucked snugly between the
wood and concrete.  Depending on the time of day this area may have
many visitors.  Please be discrete and rehide the box well.
