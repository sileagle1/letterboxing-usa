came out and for those that couldn't this year the boxes remain on <br/>
the grounds and soon I will post new clues and info to the series <br/>
there and you will find then a mailbox on the grounds with a guest <br/>
book and clues to one of the boxes and info sheets to teach others <br/>
how to enjoy letterboxing. This  will be a great starting point for <br/>
newbies as we get many school groups and such on the nature trail <br/>
which is being linked to the Snipsit trail soon. <br/>

Also from the fair a new hitchhiker called To big for a Cage left the <br/>
grounds and should be seen again  pecking about the countryside. <br/>
Thanks to all.   Leader of the Pack<br/>

</p><p>Intrepid Krink and I so enjoyed our day at the $-H fair on Saturday. It was such fun watching kids and families compete and care for their animals and, of course, we had fun letterboxing too! Your kids were very creative with their letterboxing ideas and it was just a great place for enjoying the day! The exhibits were so interesting, the food was great and the ice cold homemade lemonade hit the spot! 
</p><p>Thanks to your and your family and the 4-H for your labors of love and for making such a nice time possible. 
</p><p>Linda a/k/a Alafair
