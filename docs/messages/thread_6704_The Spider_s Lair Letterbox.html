By Web-ling (aka Rich Wendling)<br/>
Placed August 6, 2002<br/>
Fort Worth (north), Tarrant County, Texas<br/>
<br/>
To the best of my knowledge, this is the first <br/>
letterbox in Tarrant County, as well as the first <br/>
hybrid letterbox/geocache anywhere in North Texas.  <br/>
<br/>
Begin at the parking lot for Arcadia Trail Park, near <br/>
the intersection of Island Park Drive and Ash River <br/>
Road in the Park Glen subdivision in north Fort <br/>
Worth.  The latitude and longitude coordinates of the <br/>
parking lot are N3253.359 W09716.705.<br/>
<br/>
Start on the south side of the playground, and seek <br/>
the word START engraved in the sidewalk.  Walk 39 <br/>
paces (a pace is two steps) south from START along the <br/>
path to the bench on the right.  This would be a good <br/>
opportunity to see how your pace compares to mine.  <br/>
You may also want to have a seat and contemplate the <br/>
journey upon which you have embarked.  Many an <br/>
adventurer has grown faint-hearted, and turned back at <br/>
this point. <br/>
<br/>
Continue west along the paved pathway for 100 paces to <br/>
THE ARACHNIDS DINNER TABLE.  Count the number of <br/>
vertical bars supporting the table and benches.  <br/>
Multiply that number by 1.5.  This is Clue #1.  Be <br/>
careful you do not become a dinner guest.<br/>
<br/>
Continue west along the pathway for 69 paces to THE <br/>
ESCAPE ROUTE.  If the journey has become too <br/>
terrifying, you may wish to take this alternate route <br/>
and return to safety.  If you choose to continue your <br/>
perilous journey, look for a pair of initials in the <br/>
format<br/>
<br/>
AB<br/>
 +<br/>
YZ<br/>
<br/>
Substitute the letters in the initials you find for <br/>
the letters in the example.  Use the following key to <br/>
decrypt two numbers to substitute for the initials<br/>
<br/>
A=0	B=0	C=7	D=5	E=8	F=2	G=1<br/>
	H=5	I=4	J=7	K=6	L=6	M=1<br/>
N=6	O=9	P=3	Q=2	R=9	S=3	T=4<br/>
	U=3	V=8	W=4	X=2	Y=1	Z=5<br/>
<br/>
For instance if the initials are RL + NP, substitute <br/>
96 + 63, then add 96 + 63 = 159<br/>
<br/>
Now, take your answer, and double it.  In my example, <br/>
159 x 2 = 318.  This is clue #2.<br/>
<br/>
Continue west along the main pathway for another 78 <br/>
paces to THE BRIDGE OVER THE VENOMOUS RIVER.  Cross <br/>
the bridge, and travel THE PATH OF NO ESCAPE, which <br/>
ventures off the main trail on which you have been <br/>
traveling, at a heading of approximately 130.  <br/>
<br/>
After 30 paces, look for a sign on the right.<br/>
