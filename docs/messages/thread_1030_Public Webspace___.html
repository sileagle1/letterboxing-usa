OK, Folks!  This is where we need a lot of you to speak up and tell everybody else what you think?  Pros, Cons, alternatives, you name it.  Let if all fly!  Think of it as a brainstorming session.  The only bad idea is the unarticulated one.<br/>
I'm gooan try and be quiet for a while now, and look forward to many ideas and viewpoints :)<br/>

John, I know what you mean about the ads on public servers.  They are<br/>
annoying.  But, I think the fact that our site is about a hobby is clear to<br/>
visitors--we're not a slick, for-profit dot-com, we're a hobby contributed<br/>
to voluntarily by lots of different people with different interests. I<br/>
personally wouldn't be surprised to see a Web site for a hobby on a public<br/>
server.  I hope visitors would realize that the ads are simply a necessary<br/>
evil on a "free" space.<br/>
<br/>
I'd just like to vote "no" on Geocities, however.  I have friends with<br/>
Geocities Web sites, and quite often when I try to access their pages, I<br/>
get a message saying the page couldn't be found.  Then, next time, for no<br/>
apparent reason, the page downloads without a hitch.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a friend with a site on Tripod.  Never had any problems<br/>
accessing his Tripod pages - for what it's worth.<br/>

My 2 cents:   Whatever will work is okay for me...being at one consistent <br/>
location would be helpful for those who just "tune in" every once in a while, <br/>
I think.<br/>
<br/>
I hope any public webspace that is found would allow a similar map/clue page. <br/>
 I thought that was very good.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">While time is short, someone (not everyone!) should send some email to various <br/>
web hosting companies and see if any of them would support LbNA by offering <br/>
free webhosting.  Its very doable, as I successfully was able to get free <br/>
webhosting for a friend that was doing a project for some schools.<br/>
<br/>
Another alternative is to go to REI, EMS, or one of the other outdoor type <br/>
stores and see if they would sponsor a site for LbNA (downside here, is that it <br/>
starts tieing LbNA with some single outdoor outfitter.  Plus side is you may <br/>
have a major backer that can help spread the word).  If this route is <br/>
approached, I would highly suggest that it be agreed to upfront that while LbNA <br/>
would use some of their resources, LbNA does not become just theirs...<br/>
<br/>
Public webservices are good and getting better, and may be the best route for <br/>
the short time left to move someplace.  I agree with a previous poster, as to <br/>
stay away from GeoCities.  Personally, I think the ad pop-up banners on tripod <br/>
and anglefire are too annoying.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some links to look at and see what looks like it would fit for free <br/>
homepage services.  Note that some of these are ones that have no banner ads...<br/>
<br/>
http://www.stormloader.com (supposedly a ad-less free homepage service)<br/>
http://www.netcolony.com (100 meg of space for free! but no ftp access so that <br/>
may be a pain).<br/>
<br/>
There are TONS more.  Here are two links to places that list (and "review") <br/>
lots of the free homepage services:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.freewebspace.net/<br/>
http://www.freehomepage.com/<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps... (from a Colorado newbie wishing there were Letterboxes <br/>
around here...)<br/>

I hope to place a couple in CO/WY next month but just a warning they<br/>
will probably be both physically and mentally very challenging.<br/>
<br/>
Also, rumor has it that DrewClan is heading for CO :-)<br/>
