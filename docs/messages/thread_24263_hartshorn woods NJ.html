planter:<br/>
I finally had the chance to check on these boxes.  Wasn't I surprised to find <br/>
box #2 in place after it being reported missing for ages!  Boxes 3, 4, and 5 <br/>
could be there, or not.  I got 'lost' on the wrong trail and didn't have time <br/>
to check on the others.  But I did plant 2 new boxes so you have a reason to <br/>
go back.  They are listed separately.<br/>
Happy hunting.<br/>
