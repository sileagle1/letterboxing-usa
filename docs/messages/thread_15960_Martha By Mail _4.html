working on.  What great timing she has!!  She has yet to do any <br/>
bickering about this mess and that mess since my 4 year old was the <br/>
one to actually pull her out of her travelling apparatus!!  There <br/>
isn't much to do here anyway as I cleaned yesterday, she must have <br/>
known!!  Some decorating ideas have been thrown out there as we have <br/>
only lived here for 6 months and is still the way it was built in <br/>
1999.  She will be leaving us tomorrow back on her journey.  She is <br/>
on her way back to her first stop, RI!!  I hope she isn't having too <br/>
much trouble with being in four places at once!!  I know I couldn't <br/>
do that!!<br/>
