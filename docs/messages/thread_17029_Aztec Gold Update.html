<br/>
A few things to note..... As I am trying something new with this Postal Box, please, when you receive it, I ask that you not add anyone to the mailing list.  If you share it with someone in your local area, that is, of course, completely fine.  The reason that no one is to be added to the mailing list for the box is that I am going to try and track it so everyone has a chance to know where it is and when they can expect to get it.<br/>
<br/>
In view of that, the following address:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.myndworx.com/modules.php?name=PostalLB<br/>
<br/>
is useable to see where the box is and where it still needs to go......<br/>
<br/>
On that note, I've changed my mind on something.... Originally, the plane for this PLB was for people that would not be able to get to the Pacific Northwest and find the Black Pearl Series... I've had quite a few requests and I've decided to open it up to everyone that wants to get it.  So, if you want to get in on this, you still have a few days to do so!  <br/>
<br/>
I want to thank everyone that has signed up and that have offered words of support and encouragement. Thank you!!!<br/>
