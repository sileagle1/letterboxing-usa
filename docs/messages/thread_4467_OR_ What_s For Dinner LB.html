<br/>
We went out in the sun today and did your "What's For Dinner" <br/>
series.  The trail was a bit muddy, but the walk was nice.  Not many <br/>
folks out there, hmmmm, what are they working or something?  lol<br/>
<br/>
The last box had a note in it that it was found just lying around in <br/>
the open by a passing geocacher, then placed where he thought it <br/>
might have been hiding.  However, both Ryan and Amanda from Seattle <br/>
had already stamped up so maybe they rehid it where it was supposed <br/>
to be, as we had no problem locating it.<br/>
<br/>
Had a nice chuckle from the stamps.  Thanks for the fun.<br/>
<br/>
