Before I give directions let me warn you of things. First, there are things you need to know before starting out on this journey because at some point after finding the jurneez Crescent Moon letterbox, you will be addressed with some decisions to make. They will be mentioned in the directions, but please give thought with regard to the time of year you do this trek.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From Willimantic, CT take Rt. 14 from Rt. 66, (by Tony's Pizza). Follow signs staying on Rt. 14, travel 4.7m to Bass Rd. on right. Follow Bass Rd. to the "T" intersection and turn left, that's still Bass Rd., Go .3m to the entrance of the Wildlife Area at the gravel road on the right opposite a cemetery on the left. There is parking as soon as you turn in, before a steel gate.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From the west side. Get to Rt. 14 and Rt. 97 in Scotland, travel Rt. 97 south. Travel about .2m or so and turn right onto Gager Hill Rd. After turning travel without turning off at all, pass other end of Bass Rd. on left, but you stay straight until you see cemetery on right and gravel road entrance on left. Turn in and park at steel gate.<br/>
