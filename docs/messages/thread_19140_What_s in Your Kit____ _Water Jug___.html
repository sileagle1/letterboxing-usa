That would be a carry over from the military, Ryan. They usually <br/>
carry a few condoms to keep unwanted 'stuff' out of the barrel of a <br/>

Hey...what do you mean by "keeping your barrel clean"?<br/>
Don't answer that.<br/>
<br/>
If folks are worried about being stranded or needing emergency stuff, then we've gone from<br/>
'What is needed for letterboxing?' to<br/>
'What is needed for hiking a longish piece in questionable terrain?'.<br/>
