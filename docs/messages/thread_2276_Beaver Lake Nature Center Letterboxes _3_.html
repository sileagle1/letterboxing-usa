<p>(For a calendar of events, click on Beaver Lake).<span> </span>Located a short drive from the cultural, 
commercial, educational, medical and recreational center of the city of 
Syracuse, Beaver Lake Nature Center provides a 600-acre park for discovering 
one’s self. Whether you choose to bird watch, canoe, XC-ski, snowshoe, walk the 
nine miles of trails, or attend such events as maple sugaring in the spring or 
the Golden Harvest Festival in the fall, the forest, meadows and wetlands are 
guaranteed to provide you with an outdoor experience that you will pleasantly 
recall.<span>   </span>The nature center, 
being on the Atlantic ‘flyway’ for the migration of the Canada Goose, also 
provides even more wondrous entertainment in the spring and fall when geese 
<i>whiffle</i> in for a spot on the lake. </p>
<p>Since this is a county park, 
letterboxers are asked to be discreet by not disturbing other visitors to the 
park or revealing the nature of their activity.<span>  </span>Also please remember to follow the park

<p>Beaver, originally wide spread 
throughout Europe, northern Asia and North America, have rapidly disappeared in 
many locales as civilization encroached upon their environment and they became 
decimated due to their temperament and lack of adaptation for survival subject 
to being easy prey.<span>  </span>A beaver lodge 
is seldom seen, short of the wilderness, and often all that remains is a place 
name.<span>  </span>Such may be the case at the 
Beaver Lake Nature Center: twenty years ago a beaver dam could be observed at 
the lake’s outlet; today overgrown shrubs obscure the view of the channel.<span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>CLUES<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>With the eastern face of the ingle - 
[nook] vent directly behind you, set your compass for 86 degrees and strike out 
for the pine meadow.</p>
<p>2.<span>  </span>You pass a small pond on your left and 
immediately change your mind - and your direction!<span>  </span>You head into the deep woods.</p>
<p>3.<span>  </span>As you proceed through the maturing 
forest, extensive blow down devastation as a result of the 1998 Labor Day storm 
may be seen on your left.<span>  </span>Over 500 
trees at Beaver Lake, many of them giants, were toppled by the severe winds 
during the one night storm. </p>
<p>4.<span>  </span>Continue on uphill ‘midst the 
evergreens.<span>  </span>If you look carefully 
to your right you may spot several piles of ‘middens.’</p>
<p>5.<span>  </span>As you crest the ridge, off to your left 
and down the hill is the nature center’s ‘sugar bush.’</p>
<p>6.<span>  </span>Continue your walk downhill through a 
dark stand of conifers that will bring you to a short boardwalk allowing passage 
over a wetland.<span>  </span>Several species of 
ferns may be seen, two of which are the sensitive and cinnamon ferns. If weary, 
rest awhile at Patrick Murphy’s site and ponder the years with which you have 
been blessed: if you are alert you may see a white-tailed deer as it browses the 
under-story and traverses the myriad ‘herd paths’ that crisscross the 600 acres 
of the nature center.</p>
<p>7.<span>  </span>As you come upon the following 
intersection, set off at a bearing of 320 degrees. Shortly you will come to the 
bridge spanning the outlet.<span>  </span>To the 
right one can no longer attest to the presence of beaver, but other delights may 
await the visitor: varied plant life; a wood duck in flight; a Great Blue Heron 
standing silently on guard.</p>
<p>8.<span>  </span>As you retrace your steps back to the 
intersection, look for ‘turkey feathers’ on fallen logs!<span>  </span>When you reach the intersection, take a 
bearing of 216 degrees and proceed until you are within 4 paces of the sentinel 
stump that heralds the first blind spot.</p>
<p>9.<span>  </span>Forty- two paces on a bearing of 260 
degrees will bring you the second blind spot; 17 at 330 will bring you to a 
blind spot worth investigating.<span>  
</span></p>
<p>10. At a distance of 1 pace of the 
blind spot within this last blind spot, check your bearing for 260 degrees.<span>  </span>You are within 3 paces of a man made 
beaver lodge – in dry dock!<span>  </span>Pay a 
visit.<span>  </span>May you find the beaver be 
at home.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span>NOTES<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>All bearings are magnetic, and all 
bearings at intersections are taken from the center of the intersection.<span>  </span>Presently, 8/00, much logging of the 
1998 blow downs is occurring.<span>  
</span>Ignore any intersections that appear to be service/access/logging 
roads.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>A pace is taken to be the average 
an adult moves forward in one step - approximately three feet.</p>
<p>Due to being placed within the 
‘lake effect’ snow- belt area south of Lake Ontario, this box will be removed 
from snowfall to snow melt.<span>  </span>It

<p>To ‘whiffle’ means to move 
erratically; a whiffle ball and bat are recreational items; a whiffletree is 
part of the harnessing apparatus for draft animals; the Jabberwock “came 
whiffling through the tulgey wood;” a Canada Goose comes whiffling in to Beaver 
Lake.</p>
<p>During the spring and fall 
migration of the Canada Goose, mostly at sunset when they return to the lake 
from the nearby corn fields, Beaver Lake is the place to be if one wants to see 
‘a goose come whiffling in.’ The lake, often dotted with thousands of geese, may 
provide little available landing surface.<span>  
</span>By dropping a wing, and in many cases doing a quick lateral somersault, a 
goose can quickly lose altitude and land on open water.<span>  </span>Not every goose does this, but if you 
spend an hour near the shore at sunset during the migration season, you’ll 
surely see more than one goose whiffle!</p>

<p>Lakeview Trail, ‘expressway’ to the shore,</p>
<p>‘Tis not very long, less than point four.</p>
<p>There is much to see, and much to read,</p>
<p>But you’re on a goose chase, and I’m in the lead.</p>
<p>But bear with St. George, and do take the time</p>
<p>For you’ll find all the sites belabored in rhyme.</p>
<p>Enter the gate and bear to the right,</p>
<p>Each post makes a boast that draws your sight</p>
<p>To that community seldom seen</p>
<p>Less one looks closely at the verdant green.</p>
<p>Retrace thirteen paces from hummock and hollow,</p>
<p>A direction is made for you to follow.</p>
<p>Look down at your left and you will learn,</p>
<p>A bit of folklore ‘bout the Christmas fern.</p>
<p>A yuletide stocking each pinna appears,</p>
<p>And wondrous of all, it stays green all year.</p>
<p>Past hummock and hollow is Casey’s bat of ash,</p>
<p>Nearby, no doubt, a red squirrel’s stash.</p>
<p>At lake’s edge hidden from view,</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ll see a deer or two.</p>
<p>Bear right at the junction, round the point you go,</p>
<p>Take time to look, and do go slow.</p>
<p>Blow downs and turkey feathers, and bracken abound,</p>
<p>And little grey squirrels scurrying over the ground.</p>
<p>Do stop for a moment and admire the view</p>
<p>As did that American so long ago, too.</p>
<p>Next stop is a miraculous in-earth kettle,</p>
<p>10,000 years does test one’s mettle!</p>
<p>Openly serene, quietly palatial,</p>
<p>Not quickly formed, but slowly glacial.</p>
<p>Look upwards to expanse of sky,</p>
<p>Perhaps a goose will whiffle by.</p>
<p>May apples and ferns in abundance galore,</p>
<p>And a soggy supermarket ‘tis a strange kind of store.</p>
<p>A desert in the forest with light so dim,</p>
<p>Only shade loving flora can thrive within.</p>
<p>As you exit the gate, bear right and you’ll see</p>
<p>The Three Meadows entrance; just follow me.</p>
<p>Straight through you go at the roads of four,</p>
<p>‘Till poets whisper at 70 hiking paces more.</p>

</span>Plant life in desert and bog environments has one thing in common – 
survival.<span>  </span>Based upon a need for 
water and nutrients, species indigenous to each habitat have adapted 
accordingly.</p>
<p><span>            
</span>Within the bog environment, which floats, is nutrient poor and lacks 
little water flowing in or out thus slowing organic decomposition, certain plant 
species have overcome the obstacle of obtaining essential nitrogen.<span>  </span>One such example is the Northern Pitcher 
Plant. It feeds directly on insects!<span>  
</span>Be sure to look for it on your visit to the bog.</p>

<p><i>The Glacial Retreat</i> is a 
five-star restaurant for <i>letterboxers</i>. The beautifully kept grounds of 
lacy green, long known as <i>The Epicurean Delight</i> by its frequent visitors, 
the Odocoileus virginianus, beckon you towards the entrance.<span>  </span>You notice the hours are flexible; the 
prices reasonable; the menu is posted.</p>

<p align="center">Pie of Vaccinium

<p align="center"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>You enter the retreat entrance; 
you dine; you enjoy your meal. The<span>  
</span>tab is brought to you; as you prepare to pay, you wonder where the after 
dinner mints are kept.<span>  </span>You look at 
the tab once more. It reads:<span>  </span>‘The 
mints are kept in the pitcher plant’!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>With the southern face of the ingle- 
[nook] vent directly behind you, start your quest ‘twixt the <i>Isles of</i>
<i>Owl and Lonely Pine</i>; before traversing a small wooden bridge, if you bear 
off in the right direction you will soon come to the grounds’ gate for <i>The 
Epicurean Delight</i>.<span>  </span>Do watch for 
the Odocoileus virginianus! </p>
<p>2.<span>  </span>The waiting line is not long, and if you 
follow the right grounds’ path you will come to the retreat entrance very 
soon.</p>
<p>3.<span>  </span>Upon entering <i>The Glacial Retreat 
</i>get your bearing right as you pass the first hallway.<span>  </span>A short distance on and you come to the 
<i>Terrapin Pool</i>. Shortly thereafter your footing becomes more substantial 
and within a few paces you can see the Vaccinium macrocarpon on your left. 
Continue in this direction until you reach the next hallway.<span>  </span>It is the exit you will take as you 
leave the restaurant.</p>
<p>4.<span>   </span>You have heard that the third 
hallway leads to that lovely balcony, <i>The High Point</i>.<span>  </span>The entranceway decorated with luscious 
green ferns, some of them royal, entices you.<span>  </span>Once there you anxiously look 
about.<span>  </span>It has been said that during 
spring migration one can see thousands of Canada Goose from this vantage 
point.<span>  </span>What a strange phrase: a 
thousand Canada Goose!<span>  </span>Why can’t 
they be like blackbirds?<span>  </span>One Canada 
Goose; thousands of Canada Gooses!<span>  
</span>The lake is quiet today; there is nothing in sight.</p>
<p>5.<span>  </span>You hurry down the stairs and head for 
the highly acclaimed, glacially formed wooded island known as <i>The Terrace</i> 
which offers an even more commanding view of the lake.<span>  </span>Perhaps the one thousand Canada Goose 
Geese were out of your range of vision while at <i>The High Point</i>!</p>
<p>6.<span>  </span>Closing hours are fast approaching.<span>  </span>Reluctantly you leave<i> The 
Terrace</i>.</p>
<p>7.<span>  </span>You reach the exit hallway, turning 
right, and within four paces of the corner you note the most spectacular dcor 
display:<span>  </span>a grouping of tiny green 
pitchers filled with water. A life-like insect is poised on one of the 
contrasting edges. Why of course, it is the <i>Northern Pitcher Plant</i>!<span>  </span>It has been said that during the winter 
season these are reminiscent of miniature skating rinks for the tiniest of 
woodland fairies.</p>
<p>8.<span>      </span>You 
dare not linger and hurry on across the bridge</p>
<p>9.<span>      
</span>Shortly you come upon an unmarked hallway to the left.<span>  </span>As you proceed down </p>
<p>this corridor you think, ‘This must surely be the exit.’!</p>
<p>10.<span>  </span>But no! It’s the lobby 
furnished with the most rustic settee you have seen.<span>  </span>Sit</p>
<p>a while and ponder the dcor.</p>
<p>11.<span>  </span>As you prepare to leave, and within five 
paces of the settee, on your right you notice the most charming ‘potted 
cedar.’<span>  </span></p>
<p>12.<span>  </span>At the base of the ‘potted 
cedar’ is a dish. Aha!<span>  </span>The 
mints!</p>
