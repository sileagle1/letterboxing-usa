                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>In about two weeks, my family and I are going to go to Sebago Lake for a week of camping. Obviously, we're going to get in some letterboxing while we're there. I've gone through a lot of the clues for boxes in that area, and I was wondering if anyone knew about the status of any of these boxes. Secondly, is there anyone on list that would consider adopting a box if we planted one while we're there? Sebago Lake is about four hours from where we live, so we would not be able to maintain it.
