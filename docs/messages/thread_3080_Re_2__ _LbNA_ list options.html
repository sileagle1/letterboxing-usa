Nice to hear from you on this open issue Randy (and Tom).<br/>
<br/>
I think you pitched it cool and calm and level headed !<br/>
<br/>
Excellent and just the way it should be.<br/>
<br/>
Either way it turns out, I'll still be here if I may.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing list sites on both sides of the pond have a historic<br/>
(histrionic ?) reputation for anything but calmness <g> so this was a<br/>
welcome voice of reason and decency.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Glad to hear from you on this, Randy. I think you gave a very clear<br/>
&gt;account<br/>
&gt;of the issue, showing willingness to go with a clear majority feeling if<br/>

&gt;Subject: [LbNA] list options<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Just a quick (though long) note on the "list options"<br/>
&gt;&gt; thread ... for those who asked ... (and prolly more<br/>
&gt;&gt; than anyone wanted ... :-))<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; FWIW, I happen to agree with Graham in regards<br/>
&gt;&gt; to these issues (i.e., openness -- allow<br/>
&gt;&gt; attachments and allow non-members to post).<br/>
&gt;&gt; I also get the sense from reading some of the<br/>
&gt;&gt; posts that a preponderance of the opinion expressed<br/>
&gt;&gt; is along these lines as well.  The idea of the<br/>
&gt;&gt; list is to be as loose and open as reasonable<br/>
&gt;&gt; and practical, while keeping a sense of community.<br/>
&gt;&gt; List policy is decided, ideally, by consensus (but<br/>
&gt;&gt; more on that later) -- my opinion should not be<br/>
&gt;&gt; that important for shaping list policy.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; If the issue is simply spam (on the member/non-member<br/>
&gt;&gt; issue), then I would point out that the volume of<br/>
&gt;&gt; discussion of the issue possibly exceeded the<br/>
&gt;&gt; volume of the spam :-)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; These 2 issues have been coming up since the<br/>
&gt;&gt; beginning of time in many internet communities<br/>
&gt;&gt; over the years (including this one).  I wager<br/>
&gt;&gt; they will come up one or two more times on this<br/>
&gt;&gt; list by next spring.  The problem with these<br/>
&gt;&gt; issues is that people are divided on them, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; consensus is not possible to reach (or at least I<br/>
&gt;&gt; have never seen it reached on a large list).  I<br/>
&gt;&gt; will offer the opinion that attempting to reach<br/>
&gt;&gt; a consensus on these issues on this list is a<br/>
&gt;&gt; waste of time, but people are free to try ...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; What then, is the best approach to handling a<br/>
&gt;&gt; such issues?  Most lists I am on handle them<br/>
&gt;&gt; by fiat of the list managers, and the issues usually<br/>
&gt;&gt; only come up when the options are set to "open"<br/>
&gt;&gt; (because people respond to "active bother" caused<br/>
&gt;&gt; by the openness, but don't respond to the "passive<br/>
&gt;&gt; bother", if you will, brought about by "closed"<br/>
&gt;&gt; options (hopefully people get this point without<br/>
&gt;&gt; further elaboration ...).  Furthermore, The<br/>
&gt;&gt; situation is slightly different here because the<br/>
&gt;&gt; content itself on this list can be part of the game,<br/>
&gt;&gt; rather than just noise as it is on most lists.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Anyway, no matter how you set these options, a<br/>
&gt;&gt; significant fraction of the list will want them<br/>
&gt;&gt; the other way.  It is that way now (possibly), and<br/>
&gt;&gt; will be that way if we change them.  It turns out<br/>
&gt;&gt; that, logically anyway, if you leave the list options<br/>
&gt;&gt; "open", then people can take steps personally to<br/>
&gt;&gt; "close" them on their own systems (by using mail<br/>
&gt;&gt; filters, spam filters, read on the web, virus scanners,<br/>
&gt;&gt; operating systems and mail programs that are better<br/>
&gt;&gt; designed than others, etc) --  yet if you set the<br/>
&gt;&gt; options to "closed", people cannot do much personally<br/>
&gt;&gt; if they like them "open".<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; So, as a personal philosophy, I tend toward<br/>
&gt;&gt; decentralised decision making by individuals rather<br/>
&gt;&gt; than centralised decision making for all.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Now, this assumes that the issue is fairly evenly<br/>
&gt;&gt; split.  If a poll were to show a huge majority (and<br/>
&gt;&gt; don't ask me what huge is because I'm not sure), then<br/>
&gt;&gt; I would honor that.  For example, if only 2 people<br/>
&gt;&gt; wanted the options open, and everyone else wanted them<br/>
&gt;&gt; closed, then I would close them.  If it were about<br/>
&gt;&gt; 51-49%, I most likely would not make a decision that<br/>
&gt;&gt; would leave 49% of the list in a situation where<br/>
&gt;&gt; there was nothing personally that could be done.  (Feel<br/>
&gt;&gt; free to explore further or start a poll, or explore what<br/>
&gt;&gt; majority would be appropriate ...)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Just MHO ... :-)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Cheers<br/>
