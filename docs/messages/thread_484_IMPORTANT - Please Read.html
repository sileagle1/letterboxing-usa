                    <div class="plaintext-content">Fellow Letterboxers,<br/>
I want to take a moment to thank you all for participating in this Talk List. <br/>
 I put this Listserv together on the Egroups service back in October of last <br/>
year.  It has since become one of the most rewarding cyber experiences I've <br/>
encountered.  I consider each and every one of you to be a friend.<br/>
<br/>
I regret that the conversations on this list have from time to time gotten a <br/>
little too political for the average taste.  I acknowledge that many of you <br/>
have spoken up (on and off the list) to express the fact that the Talk List's <br/>
association with various letterboxing websites was causing people to lose <br/>
interest in the list.<br/>
<br/>
I feel it is now my responsibility to incorporate a few minor changes to <br/>
ensure the preservation of this Talk List.  From this point on, postings to <br/>
this group may be subject to the approval of one or more moderators, in order <br/>
to discourage inflammatory, argumentative or controversial remarks.  Previous <br/>
associations with existing websites are hereby dissolved.  Debate over the <br/>
pros and cons of these unfortunate but neccessary changes is discouraged.  <br/>
It's time to move onward.<br/>

<br/>
	I agree with Mitch about many of the sentiments expressed in his post<br/>
of this a.m.; still, I am very sad to see it come to this.<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of boring some, I would like to explain the implications of<br/>
Mitch's proporal (i.e., an alternate North American Letterbox website).<br/>
<br/>
A1) The Letterbox USA web site, if it continues as it is at present,<br/>
will remain a place where all Letterboxers can post clues and stamps, as<br/>
long as they are PHYSICALLY hosted on that server (Dan's).  Dan has told<br/>
me and others that he considers those clues/stamps residing on his site<br/>
to be in "the public domain", and thus not able to be sold or otherwise<br/>
published for profit, presumably even by their authors.<br/>
<br/>
A2) This also means that, as Dan has shared his password with a number<br/>
of you, those individuals have EDITING access to all clues on the site.<br/>
Concerns have been expressed about "security" of clues, that is, whether<br/>
they might be altered, either accidentally or intentionally, by some one<br/>
other than the author. There has been at least one example of this,<br/>
altho the change was quiclky remedied when the change was objected to.<br/>
<br/>
A3)  Clues which are physically located on other servers will not be<br/>
linked from the USA and State maps.<br/>
<br/>
A4)  Clues which are housed at the Letterbox site will likely continue<br/>
the graphic format as presently established, for a "unified" look.<br/>
........<br/>
B1)  Altho I have not discussed Mitch's proposed site in any detail, I<br/>
assume that it will also be open to all Letterboxers, that clues and<br/>
images that reside within that page can, at the author's option, be<br/>
copyrighted if they feel so inclined.<br/>
<br/>
B2)  I don't know about the password/security issue, but I assume<br/>
that.....<br/>
<br/>
.......B3)  this web site (again, my assumption) will likely provide<br/>
links to other individuals' clue pages, housed on other servers, if so<br/>
desired. This should alleviate any security" concerns.<br/>
<br/>
B4) I also assume that individuals who wish to design their own clue<br/>
page formats will be supported and encouraged to do so.<br/>
<br/>
B5) An interesting permutation: will this (N.A.) site provide links into<br/>
the Letterbox USA site? To clue pages?<br/>
.......<br/>
<br/>
	There are pros and cons for either approach. <br/>
I am concerned about yet another division among us, and by confusion<br/>
between multiple Letterboxing sites.<br/>
<br/>
	I would hope that there is always one, centralized source for links to<br/>
letterbox clues, irrespective of which server they are on.	<br/>
.....................<br/>
<br/>
	It sounds like Mitch is asking for a straw poll before he moves forward<br/>
with this. If you care to express an opinion, you might all ask<br/>
yourselves these questions:  <br/>
<br/>
	Is the "free and open" "public domain" concept valid, or of ANY <br/>
importance to you, or do you wish to retain that "ownership" of your<br/>
clues to use at your discretion?<br/>
<br/>
	Are issues such as this, plus the security and the ability to design<br/>
your own, 'non-conforming' formats important enough to warrent dividing<br/>
the group?<br/>
<br/>
	Is it important to you to have the option to house your clue pages on<br/>
the server of your choice, and linked to a central page?<br/>
..........<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I encourage all of you to remember all the hard work that has<br/>
been done by Dan, Mitch, Randy, Thom, Tom and many others.  We all need<br/>
to strive to not "take sides", but hopefully participate in both sites<br/>
if it does come to that.<br/>
<br/>
And, if anyone has an idea how we can salvage the current, one-site<br/>
model, please come forward. Please do not engage in any personally<br/>
critical attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your patience if you read this thru this far!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dear Erik and all,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Erik, for your clear explanation of the major issues <br/>
involved in our current situation.<br/>
<br/>
It is my belief that we will eventually, sooner rather than later, <br/>
need to take a different approach. We are growing as a group and will <br/>
continue to do so at an ever-increasing rate. Putting aside all <br/>
philosophical issues, I do not believe it will be possible to keep <br/>
all the clues/pages on one site.<br/>
<br/>
Dan has been willing to share his site password with others, and I <br/>
applaud him for the trust that this shows. It does raise security <br/>
issues, however, which are a concern for some of us.<br/>
<br/>
As we grow, Dan has several choices if he wants to keep all clues on <br/>
one site: He can delegate more responsibility to others, sharing the <br/>
password with more and more helpers; this will increase the risk that <br/>
clue pages may accidentally or intentionally be altered.<br/>
<br/>
He can also try to restrict the work load involved in maintaining the <br/>
site, either by creating an automated clue submission form or by <br/>
otherwise restricting the format for clue pages. This is the approach <br/>
Dan has been taking to date.<br/>
<br/>
I believe, however, that it will be impossible for one page <br/>
maintainer to keep pace with the exploding number of clues we are <br/>
hoping to see in the near future - no matter how restrictive the <br/>
format becomes. And I do not want to see it restricted. I want Randy <br/>
and others to be able to exercise their ingenuity to the max.<br/>
<br/>
The only solution, in my opinion, is a decentralization of host <br/>
sites. There needs to be one central map that provides the links to <br/>
all states and all clues. If Dan can be the manager of this, that <br/>
would be fine with me. He is the one who has pioneered the whole map <br/>
approach and done so much of the work (along with Mitch, Erik, Randy, <br/>
Thom and others). <br/>
<br/>
But the state maps and the clues do not need to be all located on the <br/>
same site. Many people can host these and the creating/editing <br/>
responsibilities shared. People who do not create their own clue <br/>
pages can have a choice of site and site editor. (I think most people <br/>
will choose to have Dan continue to do this, but Dan WILL very soon <br/>
reach a limit of the number of clues he can publish.)<br/>
<br/>
As has been said already, this decentralized approach will solve the <br/>
security concern. It will also permit maximum flexibility in <br/>
formating clue pages. I suspect that there would continue to be a <br/>
very similar "look" to the majority of pages, but this is not a major <br/>
concern for me.<br/>
<br/>
I do not see any other feasible solution to our growing needs.<br/>
<br/>
Along with Erik, I encourage respectful dialogue among us all on this <br/>
issue. The issues are not so complex that the discussion needs to be <br/>
relegated to a technical or other subgroup of the list. We are all a <br/>
part of this.<br/>
