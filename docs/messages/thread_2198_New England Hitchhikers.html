We found The Tall Ship last Saturday.  It had been stuck in port at<br/>
Washington Woods #2 since July 15th but is now traveling with us<br/>
for a few days.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we recently found Second Bludger at Bartlett Brook and it is<br/>
now awaiting a ride at another location.   Boxcar was found at Pleasant<br/>
Valley #2 on March 20th and was left at our new Birdhouse Heaven<br/>
box where the 6 Green Lizards got lucky on April 13th!<br/>
<br/>
We gave the Exeter Vampire a ride in early March.  It only stayed a few<br/>
hours at its original home (Mercy Brown) as there was no ink to suck<br/>
there!  Anyone find it yet???<br/>
