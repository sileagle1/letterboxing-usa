days off May 12-15th I will be meeting him in Erwin, TN then and I <br/>
think he wants to go to Trail Days in Damascas, VA (he won't make it <br/>
hiking, so I will drive him up there and then drive him back to Erwin)<br/>
On the AT, the Thru-hikers are all atwitter about Trail Days and will <br/>
do anything to be there.<br/>

publicist is a better word :-)<br/>
