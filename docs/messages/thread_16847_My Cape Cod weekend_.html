                    <div class="plaintext-content">  Last weekend was a chilly, but bright and beautiful leterboxing <br/>
weekend at the cape. What could beat being at Marconi Beach watching <br/>
a full moon lunar eclipse (bundled up in loads of warm clothes topped <br/>
by a wool blanket)? Well, add sipping champayne to the mix, and there <br/>
you have it!<br/>
  Boxes found:  "The Triker" (Orleans). We walked to the box.  I like <br/>
the fact the boxes in this series may be biked to OR walked to. <br/>
(Willget teh other 2 next time around).<br/>
  "The Whydah" (Wellfleet).  As mentioned in a previous message, this <br/>
box has a pirate theme to it and is well executed, right down to the <br/>
parchment paper l.b. label.  Plus, I picked up a bonus;-)<br/>
  "Uncle Tim's" (Wellfleet) A first time planting by Wellfleet <br/>
Rambler. The stamp is a mirror image of something you can see from <br/>
the placement spot. <br/>
  "Three Sisters" (Eastham) Finally!! I sought this one when the <br/>
clues were different.  I sought it when the clues were new. I finally <br/>
found it! And found another bonus;-)<br/>
  "Highland Light" (North Truro)  Good to get yet another of <br/>
LoneMassWolf's lighthouse series. Inkpad is dry and book is full, so <br/>
I wil contact the placer.  Strange to see a lighthous surrouned by <br/>
golf greens...<br/>
  "Surfcaster" (Provincetown) We love wandering around the <br/>
provincelands near the visiter's center.  It was such a pleasure to <br/>
hunt down this box. and..we ran into a family wandering around piece <br/>
of white paper in hand muttering about "the highest dune'! With <br/>
permission, as the sun was starting to set, we gave some help for <br/>
finding the correct dune.  And of course we did some exchanges. Nice <br/>
to meet Kate, Jordon, Dan, Cheryl (and Victoria) of Stafford, Ct  <br/>
They spoke of meeting the famous Wanda and Pete but I'm not sure <br/>
where. <br/>
  I placed a letterbox at Great Island in Wellfleet. Please check it <br/>
out when you have an opportunity!<br/>
  Now for the boxes that aluded me:  "Stonecroft" (Wellfleet).  I <br/>
think the leaves were doing a great hiding job, so will definately <br/>
attempt this one again.  <br/>
  "Long Pond" (Wellfleet) I cannot for the life of me figure out <br/>
where to start the hunt for this one, despite much fruitless driving <br/>
down the mentioned roads. There's always next year!<br/>
