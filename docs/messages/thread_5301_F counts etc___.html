<br/>
My two cents....<br/>
<br/>
The questions seems to be: "Is Letterboxing a numbers<br/>
game?" I am very new at this wonderful hobby, and<br/>
admittedly, my partner and I have had our celebratory<br/>
successes as well as our incredible failures in terms<br/>
of not finding the box, landing the stamp. It seems<br/>
almost sophmoric that all letterboxers have had<br/>
similar experiences. <br/>
<br/>
Those times when, for whatever reason, the box could<br/>
not be found, I still feel that we were richer for<br/>
having tried. For example, our first time out<br/>
together, we got soaked to the bone in a downpour.<br/>
Then the very next night,our search resulted in<br/>
disaster. I fell waist deep into a creek and my<br/>
partner lost a very expensive cell phone as darkness<br/>
and cooling temps were at hand. In retrospect, we were<br/>
proud that we gave it our best shot. Once dried out<br/>
and phone replaced, we resolved to return to find<br/>
those illusive boxes some time in the future. We now<br/>
laugh together over these two adventures, but we won't<br/>
give up.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how it turns out, we always get some much<br/>
needed exercise. We get to marvel at the beauty of<br/>
nature in places we might never have discovered while<br/>
feeling grateful that someone took the time and made<br/>
the effort to create and place these letterboxes in<br/>
such interesting places. We thank you. One of the most<br/>
positive aspects is that we get to shift our focus<br/>
away, run away if you will, from our day-to-day work<br/>
lives for just a little while. We get to either<br/>
rejoice over what went right or reflect over what went<br/>
wrong, often over a nice post-letterboxing dinner out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My partner and I have very little time to spend<br/>
letterboxing and, unfortunately must always compromise<br/>
on the sites we can go to. But, we have made a<br/>
decision that this is very important to us and me make<br/>
the time to go to the ones we can and we enjoy it no<br/>
matter how it turns out.<br/>
<br/>
Could all allow ourselves to change our thinking that<br/>
the number of stamps in our books, as well as the ones<br/>
we didn't get, is not necessarily indicative of<br/>
getting "the numbers" but rather a journal and a<br/>
journey of sorts of how we hard we tried?<br/>
<br/>
I sense from reading the various posts, people have<br/>
differing views of letterboxing just as we all have<br/>
differing amounts of time to devote to it. No matter,<br/>
it's an adventure, a journey, a mystery and it's fun<br/>
and there is plenty of room for all of us. I think we<br/>
all "get it" just fine in our own personal way.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening.<br/>

take away from my interest in the hobby. My first<br/>
impression of Wanda and Pete was that they are good<br/>
honest people and I for one do believe their box<br/>
count.<br/>
They do seem to have a lot of time for letterboxing<br/>
but if they do, good for them. I wish I could too.<br/>
They also seemed to still be having fun letterboxing.I<br/>
wish them the best of luck and do want to see their<br/>
box count from time to time as I would the other few<br/>
letterboxers I know. I have no desire to compete with<br/>
anyone and just want to do my thing my way and if<br/>
someone don't believe my box count someday, I really<br/>
don't care and Molly cares even less....Chuck &amp; Molly<br/>

<div>Hi, </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I like the numbers, personally, not for status but 
for context.  Someone with higher numbers may be able to provide a more 
experienced view of letterboxing.  High numbers also remind me that this 
hobby is something that continues to dazzle, well past the point where people 
cross into three digits!  That's inspiring!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, I'll continue to keep my own count (lost track 
after yesterday, but think I'm at P1 F11 and X?? now), and enjoy seeing others' 
numbers climb as they pursue this hobby.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Climbing numbers and high (to me, as a newbie) 
numbers both remind me that this is something we make a point of getting out and 
DOing, which is one of the fabulous things about this hobby.  I grew up in 
Belmont, MA, and never knew how amazing the Meadows is, until letterboxing got 
me there!  </div>
<div><br/>For me, the numbers are a reminder that there are a LOT of adventures 
to be had, and I need to step away from the keyboard and get outside. 
 Frankly, I need that steady reminder. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's not a competition, not in the broad sense, though I think a little 
personal rivalry--all in fun--is healthy to keep people playing this game.  
Who gets the first box in a particularly dazzling location, for example; that 
makes a great competition that serves all of us well.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>But particularly after meeting so many amazing and fabulous people 
yesterday, and hiking with them, I'm seeing a generosity and sharing among 
letterboxers.  Not one ounce of genuine competition or status.  In 
fact, I've rarely met a more open, supportive group.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>That's my two cents, as a newbie, who had the BEST time in the entire 
world, yesterday!  Thank you to everyone who welcomed me so nicely, shared 
tips &amp; ideas, and graciously complimented me on my stamping efforts!</div>

&gt; competition that serves all of us well.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, after being onboard here for only a bit and<br/>
being a relative newbie myself I can understand Jess'<br/>
point.  No, it's not about competition but awhile back<br/>
I do remember a whole period of time where accusations<br/>
flew like fists about someone the poster had a<br/>
personal problem with.  We never heard from the other<br/>
side (which I *Definitely* need to do before I make<br/>
any judgements on someone's character) but I do have<br/>
to say that airing this in a public forum is<br/>
definitely NOT needed, pretty immature and speaks of<br/>
the writer's character, as well.<br/>
<br/>
I also remember an explanation that it wasn't<br/>
important to get to a box first but someone liked to<br/>
get to the box first in order to sort of set the stage<br/>
and write something nice--as if the person who might<br/>
have been there before them wouldn't have.  I don't<br/>
like the connotation that leaves. <br/>
<br/>
It *is* nice to be the first to get to a box<br/>
*sometimes*.  I enjoy reading everyone's entries and<br/>
seeing everyone's stamps but sometimes, just once, it<br/>
is nice to get to a box that no one has been to- to<br/>
find that nice clean notebook to place your stamp.  I<br/>
don't feel that's being competative it's just<br/>
sometimes nice and I don't need someone telling me to<br/>
write something nice there, either. I remember my<br/>
manners, usually. :o)<br/>
<br/>
 I do have a question, though,  a legitimate one and<br/>
not based on what someone might call questioning<br/>
someone's ability to count or based on jealousy- I'm<br/>
not jealous of anyone's count, I do this as a HOBBY<br/>
and don't take myself so seriously...<br/>
<br/>
How *DO* you count? <br/>
<br/>
 I see that sometimes one comes upon a hitchiker more<br/>
than once...does that count again even though you have<br/>
it already in your book?  Does it count if you happen<br/>
to be out checking your own boxes and decide to move<br/>
it to another location?  Does it count if you figure<br/>
out from people's posts where it is, go out to get it<br/>
and then move it?  Does it count if someone gives it<br/>
to you to move for them?<br/>
<br/>
How about the number of stamps in a box?  I have<br/>
placed a box with two stamps in it that make one<br/>
image, I've come across a box with two different<br/>
stamps in it with two different stamp logs- do I count<br/>
mine as one (as I intended) and the other as two since<br/>
there are two log books and two stamps?  <br/>
<br/>
How about re-finding a box that went terribly missing<br/>
and you replanted it elsewhere, rewriting the clues<br/>
somewhat?  Is that another plant?  How far does the<br/>
box have to go to become another plant? ;o)<br/>
<br/>
I can see how this whole thing is subjective!   What<br/>
one may count in good concience might not be a count<br/>
to someone else...but where is the rule book??  <br/>
<br/>
I choose to keep my count only for myself, and frankly<br/>
I couldn't tell you what it is right now because<br/>
that's not what matters to me.<br/>
<br/>
What matters to me is that this is really a lot of<br/>
fun!  It's something I share with my bestest friend<br/>
and sometimes my family when they care to come along. <br/>
It's gotten me out of my house, it's gotten me to<br/>
places I would have never been before, it's gotten me<br/>
to think, every time I see an eraser or an image<br/>
"Would that make a good stamp?" and gotten me to think<br/>
every time I walk along a path that's dear to me,<br/>
"There would be a good place to put a box". <br/>
<br/>
It's just fun and life is too short to count how many<br/>
we have when there are so many more places to see and<br/>
so many more hikes to take.  Take the time to smell<br/>
the flowers by the path, not just tramp them down on<br/>
the way to your next find...<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion, your mileage will vary.  :o)<br/>

&gt; How *DO* you count?<br/>
<br/>
Some of how to count is in the faq which is on the lbna web<br/>
site.  Since I wrote the faq, and it doesn't answer all the<br/>
questions here, I'll say how I would count in these examples.  <br/>
Since it is all on the honor system, it doesn't matter, except <br/>
that I actually find the how to count interesting in and of <br/>
itself.  (I enjoy trying to find simple structure of rule that<br/>
handles complex and unanticipated questions).<br/>
<br/>
So, if Wanda posting her F count lead to something I found<br/>
interesting, it was worth it, wasn't it :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I see that sometimes one comes upon a hitchiker more<br/>
&gt; than once...does that count again even though you have<br/>
&gt; it already in your book? <br/>
<br/>
Count once -- its like finding the same static box more <br/>
than once.  A box is a box is a box is my general principle.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Does it count if you happen  to be out checking your own <br/>
&gt; boxes and decide to move it to another location?  <br/>
<br/>
No.  I would only count an HH as planted if I were the<br/>
creator.  Moving an HH should never count as a plant.  <br/>
Boxes always have one P and many Fs (IMHO YMMV :-)).  A<br/>
box is a box is a box.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Does it count if you figure out from people's posts where <br/>
&gt; it is, go out to get it and then move it?  <br/>
<br/>
Assuming you are referring to HHs still, count as an F, not <br/>
a P, tho people should not give away the location of boxes <br/>
other than their own in their posts, IMHO.  Any box found<br/>
due to careless people giving it away still counts as an<br/>
F, and never move a box unless its instructions say it is <br/>
ok to move it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Does it count if someone gives it to you to move for <br/>
&gt; them?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; How about the number of stamps in a box?  I have<br/>
&gt; placed a box with two stamps in it that make one<br/>
&gt; image, <br/>
<br/>
This is in the FAQ.  Count per box, not stamp.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I've come across a box with two different<br/>
&gt; stamps in it with two different stamp logs- do I count<br/>
&gt; mine as one (as I intended) and the other as two since<br/>
&gt; there are two log books and two stamps?<br/>
<br/>
A box is three things.  Clue, stamp, and place.  Unless<br/>
all three are different, count as 1.  All 3 must change for<br/>
a box to be considered changed, and thus to be countable<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; How about re-finding a box that went terribly missing<br/>
&gt; and you replanted it elsewhere, rewriting the clues<br/>
&gt; somewhat?  Is that another plant?  How far does the<br/>
&gt; box have to go to become another plant? ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Again, stamp, clues, and location must all change.<br/>
Changes can be trivial, just like I could, in about<br/>
an hour, create 1000 boxes in my basement.  Again, its<br/>
all in the spirit and honor anyway.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I can see how this whole thing is subjective!   What<br/>
&gt; one may count in good concience might not be a count<br/>
&gt; to someone else...but where is the rule book??<br/>
<br/>
I don't claim the faq and my opinions as the rulebook,<br/>
but I do claim they are neutral.  Yes, there will always<br/>
be cases that come up that are not covered by the<br/>
"rulebook" ... :-)<br/>
<br/>
And, yes, the FAQ could use an updating ...<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I think competing to be first can be cool.  I<br/>
think competing on F and P can be cool.  I think ignoring<br/>
this can be cool too.  The woods are big enough and there<br/>
are enough diverse clues and enough ways to combine<br/>
words for everyone to do their own thing.<br/>
<br/>
