<br/>
Placed by: Teach &amp; Preach (help from Little Piggy &amp; Nappy Kitty)<br/>
Location: Pomfret Ct. Windham County<br/>
Rate: easy<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  From 44east through Pomfret turn left onto Railroad <br/>
Street.  There is a big American Flag painted on a building before <br/>
the turn onto Railroad Street.  Park by the big tree that's circled <br/>
off with bricks.  This is the same starting point as Pomfret <br/>
Station.  Go in the direction of 190 degrees from the tree.  Take the <br/>
left path at the Y.  Walk around the green gate.  Follow the railroad <br/>
bed.  You'll pass birch trees that look like a V on your left.  Hills <br/>
on both sides of the railroad bed, the left side will gradually come <br/>
down before the right side.  Take the path on your left that leads up <br/>
a grassy hill(This is were we take Jody &amp; Sam for walks).  At the top <br/>
of the hill you'll see a nice view of Pomfret.  Keep walking east.  <br/>
You'll see a pine tree &amp; a 3 sister birch tree at a SE direction.  <br/>
Head toward them.  To the left in the small stone by a cedar tree <br/>
under a brick is the Jody &amp; Sam Letterbox.  Please rehide well. <br/>
<br/>
Have fun:  Teach &amp; Preach<br/>
