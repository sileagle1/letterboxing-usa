                    <div class="plaintext-content">sorry Enders and I couldn't make it to the Philly gathering, he was <br/>
just not up to the amount of exertion it would take after all the <br/>
medical tests and stuff, we just went back to the hotel and took <br/>
naps instead then went home the next day. We did some lite boxing on <br/>
the way home and collected a couple of neat drive by ones.<br/>
<br/>
Mom (Bindle Babe) and Dad (Bindle Bum) didn't have the sailing trip <br/>
they were expecting. Mom ended up in the hospital with double ear <br/>
infections, a sinus infection and pneumonia in her lower left lung. <br/>
They're coming home as soon as she gets the ok to travel, right now <br/>
she's got a couple more days on the boat they chartered but under <br/>
dr. orders not to fly for 10 more days but I don't think they'll <br/>
stay in FL that long. She said to tell you all that she'll finish <br/>
her virtual series when she gets back and get everyone added to the <br/>
honor rolls.<br/>
<br/>
The 2 questions are:<br/>
Mom didn't get to plan the boxes she had ready for the FL trip. I'd <br/>
like to offer to plant them with her when she gets back to MI but <br/>
what do you guys think about planting boxes with flamingos, pirate <br/>
flags and cheeseburher in paradise boxes in MI? I don't want to <br/>
upset her about not getting to plant the boxes, but was thinking we <br/>
could make it a the-trip-that-wasn't series or something.<br/>
<br/>
Last question is about boxes that other people made. Mom and I made <br/>
boxes that were left with other boxers in OR and WA from her trip <br/>
out there. We also got one from a OR boxer who wanted it to be <br/>
planted in MI. When the PNW boxers plant them and when we put the OR <br/>
boxers out, who gets to count them in their "P" number? The maker, <br/>
the one who put them out, or both?<br/>
<br/>
TIA, <br/>
Enders Angel<br/>

I think I would have really loved to find those boxes here in FL.   (said <br/>
ever-so-wistfully)<br/>

<br/>
That's fine.  Just call the series something like, "Wishing I were in <br/>
Florida!"  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; who gets to count them in their "P" number? The maker, <br/>
&gt; the one who put them out, or both?<br/>
<br/>
You'll never find any agreement on sticky issues such as that.  I <br/>
like to count it based on if I actually hid the box and created the <br/>
clues, but everyone will have their own opinion.  There's no <br/>
consensus.  Just do whatever you feel is "right".<br/>

<br/>
Seems to me the obvious solution<br/>
would be to plant them in Paradise,<br/>
MI. Or, If you don't mind a six-<br/>
hour boat ride, Isle Royale Natl<br/>
Park is considered the *northern-<br/>
most* point in Michigan (whereas<br/>
Key West would be... well, you<br/>
know.)<br/>
<br/>
If the U.P. is out of range,<br/>
any place with a reference to <br/>
parrots, sailing, islands, or<br/>
snowbirds ought to suffice.<br/>
