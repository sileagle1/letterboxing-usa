                    <div class="plaintext-content">On Sunday 9-7-02 Chickabirdie, Molly and myself visited the 2 cupcake <br/>
boxes in Lisbon CT. The second stamp which is the purple frosting for <br/>
the cupcake is broken in 3 pieces. You can use it by carefully <br/>
stamping each piece, one at a time but it does need replacing. <br/>
We were also very pleased to finally make it to Ruth's Run which is <br/>
in the same park. We have been wanting to get there for a while now, <br/>
since the day we met Patrick and Amy in Bozrah. No problem with that <br/>
box. Very nicely done and a great place for Ruth to run and have a <br/>
good time. Enjoyed the area and had a nice day letterboxing. Thanks <br/>
Patrick Amy and Ruth......Chuck,Molly,and Chickabirdie<br/>
