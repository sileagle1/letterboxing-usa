Hi Littlemonkey<br/>
<br/>
If you look to the lefthand side of the homepage you will find a <br/>
listing for Database. If you click on this you can locate the <br/>
remnants of the database that caused the uproar quite sometime back. <br/>
This was a listing that allowed finders to record their finds and <br/>
this was detested by many planters(and still is). Several planters <br/>
pulled their clues and others came close. Shortly after this <br/>
function went away there was atleast one Yahoo group started that <br/>
decided to list finds and shortcuts. Many planters started putting a <br/>
notice on their clue sheets regarding notification of finds (if <br/>
interested you could check anyone of our clue sheets for this <br/>
notice).Then the flags appeared which did give the placer a little <br/>
more controll over their clues.<br/>
 The entire concept of recording finds generally is split between <br/>
the newletterboxers that like electronic recording and listing and <br/>
the old letterboxers (Silverbacks) that like the way the game was <br/>
originally set up here in the USA, where the site was merely a <br/>
collection of clue sheets. Now notice I said generally, otherwise <br/>
someone will jump in and dispute my statement. Also generally those <br/>
that do not like the recording aspect are those with the most plants <br/>
and there is a different point of view that planters have as <br/>
compared to those that are finders. The recording functions only <br/>
help finders locate those letterboxes that can be assured of being <br/>
viable thus increasing their F count. <br/>
 As a placer I could care less about someones F count. We set up our <br/>
letterboxes to take a finder to a neat spot, solve clues,a bit of <br/>
history, great scenery,and give them an image of a passable <br/>
handcarved stamp.<br/>
This database/recording topic is nothing new, and for the most part <br/>
will always be a contentious one, I think it is a great subject. It <br/>
is a good idea for everyone to realize that placers have different <br/>
mindsets than finders. A planter may take several days to set up a <br/>
letterbox, while a finder may take an hour or two to locate that <br/>
same box. A note of thanks sent to that placer via the chatlist or <br/>
directly may add a minute or two to the finders time. That is about <br/>
the same amount of time it takes to electronically record the find.<br/>
<br/>
Okay nuff about history, and a planter's point of view.<br/>
<br/>

Thank you for taking the time to give this point of view.  It's good for those of us who <br/>
haven't placed any boxes yet to keep in mind that placing a letterbox is a very involved <br/>
process and this makes me value even more the planters of the really good letterboxes I've <br/>
been able to find thus far.  Thanks to you and everyone else who has planted or is planting <br/>
them now.  I don't think that we can praise you too often!<br/>
