&gt; And last but not least.. it's bothered me before and I bit my <br/>
tongue...and it <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Psychomommy...you start your post noting that we all have a right <br/>
to our <br/>
&gt; opinions...then proceed to shotgun blast another for theirs.  You <br/>
also imply <br/>
&gt; in your post today and others you've penned in the past, that your <br/>
battle <br/>
&gt; with cancer has given you a 'it's all wonderful and our time here <br/>
is so <br/>
&gt; short' outlook on life, (as I imagine it would) but the nature of <br/>
some of <br/>
&gt; your past posts and this recent one...has been diametrically <br/>
opposed to what <br/>
&gt; you preach.  If time is so short and it's 'what we do with <br/>
situations that <br/>
&gt; matter,' why waste energy lambasting others?    <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are truly "sick and tired of political correctness" you <br/>
shouldn't mind <br/>
&gt; the following...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please stop playing the cancer card every time you strongly <br/>
disagree with <br/>
&gt; someone else's posts.  (I know, I've been on the receiving end of <br/>
one of your <br/>
&gt; "I survived cancer therefor..." postings during the <br/>
infamous 'Lizardbutt <br/>
&gt; controversy.'  There is not one among us who's life cancer has not <br/>
touched.  <br/>
&gt; Cancer sucks...but being a cancer survivor doesn't make your <br/>
opinions more or <br/>
&gt; less valid.  (It only makes you blessed for having beaten it.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my two cents.<br/>
