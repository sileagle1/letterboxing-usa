To commemorate your 300th find how about telling us some of your <br/>
favorites: favorite stamps, places and clues?<br/>

&gt; It is amazing what one can do in a month! ;-)  I found my 200th <br/>
box <br/>
&gt; (including HH's) on Dec. 14th!  Then found my 300th box (NOT <br/>
including HH's) <br/>
&gt; yesterday at an undisclosed bonux box in CT.  I can't tell you <br/>
where, since <br/>
&gt; if you haven't done the series, I don't want to give up the <br/>
surprise, but I <br/>
&gt; can tell you that it was a morbid experience finding your 300th <br/>
box in a <br/>
&gt; cemetery!  Actually, it wasn't that morbid, but I wonder what <br/>
finding your <br/>
&gt; 300th box in a cemetery means????  LOL<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I gave myself until the MA Gathering to get to 300, and <br/>
now I'm <br/>
&gt; victorious, so the pressure's off!  Since I have a concert <br/>
tonight, I'm going <br/>
&gt; to start building a gazebo on Wednesday!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy Trails everyone!<br/>
