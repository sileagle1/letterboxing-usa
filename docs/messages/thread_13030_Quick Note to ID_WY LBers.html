Everyone kept telling me if we plant them, they will come...slowly, <br/>

them and letting us know about their status.<br/>

<br/>
FYI, I just found the Elks in Jackson today.  It now has three stamps and one hitchiker stamp.  That's the first time I've found other stamps in your UT, ID, or WY boxes so I was excited. Nice too how your clues took us to every single nature trail marker before we ended up within feet of the starting point.  My friends were laughing, but I think they enjoyed it.  The funny thing was that one of them joked about "this is kind of like that silly National Parks Stamp thing too that little kids do."  He was a litte embarrassed when I told him I did that too, and that I know more retired types that do it then kids. (:<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I didn't find the Jackson Square box.  It was there this weekend b/c someone else found it, but I'm quite sure I was looking in the right place.  I also had coworkers look around all the other posts and under the boardwalk around the area and nobody found anything.  I have never had problems finding your boxes before.  I have a couple of theories.  The town square looked recently groomed right by the boardwalk-could be found by a park employee. There is also some work being done on the section of the boardwalk that I thought it should be.  It is covered with several work pieces and the boardwalk doesn't have room to put anything under it.  Could the weight possibly have pushed the boardwalk down over the spot?  Also, the town square is highly public.  Could someone have seen someone looking this weekend and hunted themselves.  And finally, is always the possibility that I am just wrong and didn't look in the right spot.  I don't know that this was the case since I haven't had a problem before with yours, but then you never know. My coworkers took the compass themselves and came up with the same reading I had. Email me off list and I can share more specifics to see if I can't locate it for you. Again, Jackson's close enough to home that I would be happy to replant if needed.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great trip.<br/>
Cadenza<br/>
