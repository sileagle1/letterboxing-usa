 but a hitchhiker is more fun to find when you least expect it.  I have only found one but it really made my day when I opened that letterbox up and discovered it.  Please remember this is Just my opinion so please don't send me hate mail :) Curious to see how everyone else feels about this.  Should I post when I re-plant it and give clues ... to me that takes part of the thrill away from the hunt....<br/>

</p><p>If I found a HH, and the Owner's email address was included, I would write to that person off-list and tell them where I found it. I think most people who plant HHs like to know their whereabouts.  I would never post where I re-planted it as that would spoil the surprise for the next finder.
