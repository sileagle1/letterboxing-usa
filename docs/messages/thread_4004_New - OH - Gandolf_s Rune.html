Difficulty: 1  A walk through a city park<br/>
Near: Greenville, Darke County, OH<br/>
Placed 28 December 2001 by<br/>

<br/>
This is the site of the treaty signing that ended the Indian wars in <br/>
the Ohio Valley in the 19th Century.  It was quiet walking through <br/>
the park this December day.  I have been here a number of times when <br/>
the park is crowded with cross country runners.  <br/>
<br/>
Driving can be confusing in Greenville if you enter on route 49.  I <br/>
have gotten lost more than once.  From the east, take US 36 until it <br/>
becomes State 571 and take 571 into Greenville.  From Dayton, take <br/>
State 49 to the intersection with US 36 a mile outside town.  Take 36 <br/>
north to 571 and enter town on 571.  <br/>
<br/>
Reaching a fork in the road, head right on Broadway.  Go around the <br/>
traffic circle 180 degrees and then turn right at the next street, <br/>
Water Street.  Two blocks down, turn left on Memorial.  Follow this <br/>
past the Masonic Lodge to a small parking lot at Memorial and <br/>
Quindora.  <br/>
<br/>
Getting out of the car, take the sidewalk at 330 degrees until you <br/>
pass over the footbridge.  You can imagine this bridge to be any of <br/>
the bridges in Lord of The Rings if you like.   Stopping across the <br/>
road at the Coppock Memorial, go 70 degrees for 163 paces (1 pace = 2 <br/>
steps, or about 5 feet).  You will reach the end of a road.  On your <br/>
right, note the Dwarf's ancient mining engines.  <br/>

I deserved that poke.<br/>
<br/>
And I am not entirely blameless... I have read the other letterbox it <br/>
now occurs to me...  It was weeks ago but was still, no doubt <br/>
bouncing around inside my cranium when I was checking up on some <br/>
details from the new Lord of the Rings movie by looking through the <br/>
book.  <br/>
<br/>
I ran across the letter that Gandolf left for Frodo and friends with <br/>
the strange character signature.  Characters (the written, not the <br/>
personal kind) are often referred to as runes in the series.  I <br/>
carved Gandolf's on a stamp and left it out in a park I had visited <br/>
several times in the last year.  <br/>
<br/>
The real goal yesterday was to put letterboxes in two new counties <br/>
here in OH.  130 miles later, both were put in place.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the original box would be much more fun than mine.  But if <br/>
you have a little less time than necessary to solve the original rune <br/>
puzzle (or if you are in Ohio), try the Ohio box.  <br/>
<br/>
Not meaning to step on toes..<br/>
