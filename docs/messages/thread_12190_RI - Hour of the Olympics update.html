<br/>
All three boxes were somewhat exposed, but the first 2 were none the worse for it.  We hid them back a little more discreetly.  The last box, "Cool Runnings," was completely soaked through.  The pen must have exploded, as it was broken.  The stamp pad is ruined.  There was a note in there from someone who found it that way and it said that he tried to dry it out and left a Happy Meal toy inside.  Someone was there afterwards, apparently, as there was no geocache-type stuff inside.  We took the box home to dry out the log book and to replace the bags and such.  Trish, if you want to start a new log, just let me know.  I can either put it back "as is" when dry or get another 3x5 book, or get the stuff to you.  I think that the plastic container is no better or worse than it was when new, only stained red, so I'll just keep that the same unless I see a similar replacement in my travels.  I have no idea how this box would have gotten so saturated if closed right and tucked under the ledge.  <br/>
<br/>
It should only take a few days to dry the book out and replace the ink.  I'll post.<br/>
