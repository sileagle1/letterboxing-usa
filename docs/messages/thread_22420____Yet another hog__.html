  I was there 9:30 to 3:30 on August 11. I only noticed two vehicles<br/>
while I was on the plateau, a bluish minivan and a camper on a large<br/>
white PU.  I still have some boxes to get for my next trip.  My post<br/>
on LBNCA:<br/>

I went for a romp in the park thursday. I went alone and got a late<br/>
start, 9:30 from the parking lot. It was HOT, but I brought lunch and<br/>
a lot of water. I started out by finding the geocach. Good thing to<br/>
because I used some of the sunscreen I found in it. I took me quite a<br/>
while to find the 15 boxes and Macon HH. I didn't leave until 3:30. I<br/>
figure I drank 80 ounces of water, and on the way back to Redding for<br/>
pork chops for dinner, the bank sign in Red Bluff read 105 degrees.<br/>
Pigmalion could use some maintence. The box has broken and cannot be<br/>
sealed. It could use a bigger box.<br/>
