<br/>
If you aren't used to alot of walking this one may wear you out. It wore me<br/>
out when I planted it. Bring plenty of water in case you get thirsty and I<br/>
guarantee you will.  You will also need a compass.  Bearings are Magnetic.<br/>
<br/>
Backwards Bob wanted to fly a kite, so he went to the most popular place in<br/>
Virginia Beach to do so.<br/>
<br/>
He parked right in front of a lighthouse and walked up a flight of steps.<br/>
"Whew, I havent done that in a while, I need to sit down." He found a stone<br/>
bench and sat a while to catch his breath. The bench was in front of a large<br/>
tree, planted by a woman's society. As he looked at the tree, he heard the<br/>
sounds of laughter and playing to his left. He looked a saw children playing<br/>
in a wooden cove.<br/>
<br/>
"That looks interesting"<br/>
<br/>
He got up and walked down the mountain, heading for this cove that isnt a<br/>
true cove. He wandered around this fun place and noticed another playground<br/>
a distance away that didn't seem as popular. "How sad."<br/>
<br/>
He decided to swing on the neglected swings a bit and slide down the slides.<br/>
As he stood at the top of the slides he heard another odd sound.  He slid<br/>
down and went to investigate this new sound.  He came upon a tree that has<br/>
these strange bugs on it.  They were Cicadas and they were breaking out of<br/>
their Pupa stage.  He watched them for a long time and was a bit startled by<br/>
a lizard running over his shoe.  He decided to follow this lizard and chased<br/>
it under a large flat rock.  He looked under the rock and instead of a<br/>
lizard guess what he found?<br/>
<br/>
Directions.<br/>
<br/>
Follow Bob's path untill you get to the slides.  Climb to the top of the<br/>
slides and stand between the two, then look due north, Over the top of the<br/>
furthest tree of three you will see a tall pine tree.  Go to that tree and<br/>
marvel at all of the little cicada husks you find there.  Then turn left and<br/>
walk about 18-20 steps where you will find a large flat rock.  Underneath is<br/>
the surprise!  If you have a hard time finding it and wish for a hint, email<br/>
me!<br/>
