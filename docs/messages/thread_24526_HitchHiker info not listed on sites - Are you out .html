<br/>
Sonoran Girl and I did find that one, too, here in Arizona (if I'm thinking of the right "Bookworm" hitchhiker) - and we couldn't find it on AQ or on the LbNA website, either.  I don't know if that gives you much comfort or not, but I just wanted to let you know that you weren't alone in not being able to log it.  :)  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck and I hope that you find something to make you smile and laugh today!! :)<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] HitchHiker info not listed on sites - Are you out there Honeybee?<br/>
<br/>
The first hicthhiker I found is not listed anywhere that I can find, <br/>
but I wanted to make it known where it is traveling so the placer would <br/>
know if she is watching... It was called "The Bookworm" and the placer <br/>
is Honeybee from PA. Anyone else found this one or are you the placer?<br/>
