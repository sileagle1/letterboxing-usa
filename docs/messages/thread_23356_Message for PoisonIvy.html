     I now beg of you, in the name of Der Mad Stampers sanity, not to mention my need of carving materials, to examine what is before you and solve this case before the PZKut becomes history. <br/>

Hmm! Certainly this is obvious to even the most casual of followers of<br/>
the mystery....the culprit is Spring Chick.  Who else didn't get<br/>
enough cold white stuff over the past winter?....And now is going<br/>
through withdrawal so bad she now must shred *white stuff* to sprinkle<br/>
on her window sills so she can pretend it's still winter outside??????<br/>

     Yes, it has indeed been a month. Not only does Mr. Der Mad Stamper continue to whine, cry, and throw tantrums, I can not continue on with my work until this is solved. When I accepted this case Mr. Der Mad Stamper assured me that he had many friends in the letterboxing community, he was convinced that you are a network of mystery solvers. Where are his friends now in his time of need?<br/>
