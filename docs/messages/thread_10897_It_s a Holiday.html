                    <html><body>We had quite an adventure getting It's a Holiday yesterday!  When we got there (with an extra 9-year-old in tow), someone was sitting on The Bench.  We had to wait about 10 minutes for her to go away.  Then we grabbed the bench, found the box,  and started merrily stamping.  Just as we were about finished, a security guard came and stood RIGHT OVER OUR SHOULDERS and started TALKING INTO HIS WALKIE-TALKIE!  Freaked Mom out.  She grabbed the box and stamp and grabbed the boys and got OUT OF THERE!    We walked to a different part of the mall where Mom left the boys for a few minutes to see if she could get the box replaced.  She figured the security guard was looking for someone with 2 boys and a camouflage backpack so she left the boys and the backpack.  Someone sitting on The Bench again.  So we all went down to the food court, had a snack, and after about 45 minutes Mom tried again.  This time the coast was clear, although Mom felt like every security guard in the place was looking at her.  She pretended to make a cell phone call, replaced the box as subtly as possible, and went back down to the boys.  Then we all got on the Metro and went home.  We hope we didn't mess things up too much for Holiday.  It's a great stamp!
<br/>
<br/>Anyway, if someone was trying to find it between 3 and 4 yesterday (Saturday 2/22), we had it during that time.  Sorry if we inconvenienced or confused you. For the next holiday, I think we'll take it down to the Food Court to stamp in.  D and Shoo</body></html>
