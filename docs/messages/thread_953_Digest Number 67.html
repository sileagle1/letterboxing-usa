Thanks for the map update. Too bad I didn't catch you sooner. I went out and <br/>
hid a couple more boxes at Jug Bay Wildlife Sanctuary in Maryland. You might <br/>
want to put them on the map as well. I plan on filling the state with dots. <br/>
Here is the web page: http://hometown.aol.com/twograysquirrels/page2.html<br/>
<br/>
Also the Wheaton Regional dot needs to move out of DC and into Maryland. If <br/>
you could move it to just outside the top corner of DC that would be closer <br/>
to the mark. Thank you every so much. I'm nuts about yous guys.<br/>

You are welcome. Glad to hear of your plans to fill up Maryland. I <br/>
know Randy and John in PA will be happy about that, as well as your <br/>
locals.<br/>
<br/>
I looked at a Jug Bay site on the map - what a beautiful spot. <br/>
Nothing is prettier than wetlands IMO. The Tiger Map serivce couldn't <br/>
locate either Lothian or Bristol. Can you give me the nearest <br/>
incorporated town to Jug Bay?<br/>
<br/>
I think the dot for Wheaton Park  on the _regional_ map is <br/>
essentially correct -  a bit to the north of DC. I would prefer <br/>
not to put a separate dot for Wheaton on the _state_ map as that <br/>
would be crowding the DC dot a bit. Let me know if I'm <br/>
misinterpreting your comment above.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

GNIS found Lothian, MD at 384954N, 0763642W.  GNIS is yet another<br/>
wonderful American taxpayer financed tool that can locate just about <br/>
anything if its on a map.  It never ceases to amaze me that you can <br/>
enter the name of some gulch that some prospector named 150 years ago, <br/>
and if its on a map, GNIS has a chance of finding it for you.  Then <br/>
you're a few clicks away from a contour map or terraserver.  Us clue <br/>
writers always have to stay one step ahead of the technology :-)<br/>
<br/>
GNIS is at http://mapping.usgs.gov/www/gnis/gnisform.html if anyone is<br/>
interested.<br/>

<br/>
Mabye it should say "DC Metro" or something.  I dunno.<br/>
