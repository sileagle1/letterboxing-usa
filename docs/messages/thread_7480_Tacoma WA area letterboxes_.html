Why they do not appear on the LbNA list I don't know.<br/>
Maybe one of the Webmasters can enlighten us?<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Tacoma WA area letterboxes?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I'm not sure what's going on here but there are several extremely<br/>
&gt; interesting letterboxes in the Tacoma, WA area that are missing from<br/>
&gt; the LBNA site.  I recently located them (over the last 2 months) and<br/>
&gt; they are in rather neat locations and pretty unique stamps.  My<br/>
&gt; children really enjoyed the hunts and they were ideal opportunities<br/>
&gt; for teaching them about our surroundings.  The ones I noticed<br/>
&gt; missing are:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Titlow Park, Tacoma<br/>
&gt; Tacoma Nature Center<br/>
&gt; several different boxes in Point Defiance Park<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are these boxes no longer there?  Or is there a glitch in the<br/>
&gt; software?<br/>
