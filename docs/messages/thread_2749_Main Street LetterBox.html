 MAIN STREET<br/>
[Unable to display image]<br/>
By now you should know Collinsville IL's Main Street up and down! <br/>
There is yet another box planted and waiting to be found. <br/>
Locate the BULL ! He won't be in a pasture! <br/>
Head SW then SE at the corner and SW again to cross Center. <br/>
Stop and check the walk to gain <br/>
your bearings. <br/>
Hurry or it may rain. <br/>
Continue walking SW. You've been here before! <br/>
Main Street is the location you seek( don't pass it up). Enter at the door. <br/>
Who knows, you might find a good book and a bargain! <br/>
Search once through the kid's section and then do it again. <br/>

Be sure to let Main Street know why you came! <br/>

 PS. As of April 2, 2001 <br/>
The Across the Board box has been removed due to the store closing but plans <br/>
are to replace it somewhere else on Main Street. <br/>
Also the Catsup Bottle has been poached and plans are in the works to replace <br/>
that one also. <br/>
