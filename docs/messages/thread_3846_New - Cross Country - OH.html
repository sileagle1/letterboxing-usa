Difficulty: 2<br/>
In Kettering, Montgomery County, OH<br/>
Placed 3 Dec 01 by Flyfisher <br/>
<br/>
Park at N 39.6940 W 84.1140.  You may use a GPS to find this parking <br/>
lot in Kettering, Ohio, or use the www.topozone.com website to make a <br/>
topographic map of the area at large scale for driving and at small <br/>
scale for walking.  The topographic map does not show the lake that <br/>
has been added to the park.   <br/>
<br/>
Once at the park, find the very high spot next to the lake.  All the <br/>
high school and college cross country races climb this "mount" at <br/>
least twice.  I have run all over the park many times chasing one or <br/>
another of my children as they raced.  If you are here when the <br/>
ground is white, take care for your life.  Sleds come down the hill <br/>
at regular intervals.<br/>
