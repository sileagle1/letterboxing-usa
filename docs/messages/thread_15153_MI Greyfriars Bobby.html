<br/>
We're in Belleville, and looking forward to finding Greyfriars Bobby <br/>
soon -- we just started letterboxing about 3 weeks ago, and are <br/>
excited to see a few in the SE Michigan area.  Have you planted any <br/>
other boxes in the area? <br/>
<br/>
We'll try to remember to bring some ziplocks with us when we search <br/>
for this box -- what size?  Gallon? <br/>
<br/>
gotta find some places to plant our own &amp; get some stamps carved.  SE <br/>
Michigan needs more boxes!  ;) <br/>
<br/>

A quart sized bag will do, it's a 2cup sized container. Thanks<br/>
<br/>
I just placed a letterbox called "Strongheart" at Maybury Rec area, <br/>
another of the notable dog series, but haven't written the clues <br/>
yet.  I've planted a couple of other boxes, but my first <br/>
got "critterized", and the others were temporary boxes which have <br/>
since been removed.<br/>
Stay tuned, there are more in the works, and there are some recent <br/>
converts in our area that should be placing boxes soon.<br/>
