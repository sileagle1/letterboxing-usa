be counted in their annual, semi-serious census ("official" total for <br/>
this year: 935).  While there, we took the opportunity to sightsee <br/>
and look for a couple of letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Indian Cemetery and Southeast Lighthouse were easy to find.  North <br/>
Lighthouse was not.  We saw only one "paving stone" that matched the <br/>
description, and it wouldn't budge!  I checked the archive to see if <br/>
anyone reported this one missing, but came up with nothing.  Were we <br/>
in the right spot?  Looking at the right stone?  If Ann &amp; Kathryn T <br/>
contact me via email I have digital pictures of the area and of the <br/>
stone we identified that I can send: cscm at edgenet dot net.<br/>
<br/>
We didn't attempt White Rock at Black Rock as we didn't think we had <br/>
the time.  Next trip!<br/>

PS: Kim and I plan to attend the dinner in Sterling, MA, on the <br/>
16th.  I'll be RSVPing to the proper authorities soon.  Looking <br/>
forward to meeting some new people and exchanging some stamps!<br/>
