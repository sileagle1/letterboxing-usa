Anyone bought any pink stuff lately?  Anyone notice it is slightly<br/>
thicker, slightly softer and more crumbly (and IMHO harder to deal<br/>
with)?  Did I get a bum batch, or did they change the formula?  Anyone<br/>
confirm or deny the rumors?  I also noticed they didn't print the bar<br/>
code and other stuff on it like they usually have in the past.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There appear to be two different formulations of the pink stuff.  <br/>
This is a cut 'n paste from a message I posted in August (Caution - <br/>
The Pink Stuff, 8/25/02):<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Be careful when buying the Speedball Speedy-Stamp <br/>
&gt;pink carving material. There are two different types!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Deciding this was my carving medium of choice, the <br/>
&gt;other day I went to my local Hobby Lobby and picked up <br/>
&gt;three 4 x6 pieces and an 8 x 12 piece. I quickly used <br/>
&gt;up the first 4 x 6 piece and opened the second, only to <br/>
&gt;find it is different material than the first! It has <br/>
&gt;a tacky surface and the inner consistency is harder to <br/>
&gt;carve. Even after cleaning it up, my knife pulled and <br/>
&gt;jerked -- didn't carve smoothly at all (even with a brand <br/>
&gt;new sharp knife blade). The packaging is identical, but <br/>
&gt;upon closer inspection, the coloring is a little different <br/>
&gt;(the good stuff is slightly lighter in color), the product <br/>
&gt;numbers are different (good stuff - 4108, year 2001; bad <br/>
&gt;stuff - 4110, year 2000) and the bad stuff doesn't have <br/>
&gt;the UPC imprinted right on the block.<br/>
<br/>
My store was really good about it and took the bad stuff back even <br/>
though I had opened one package and started carving it -- the <br/>
composition difference was that noticeable, even to them!<br/>
<br/>
I have since changed to using PZCut, which is cheaper and I have <br/>
found easier to carve and get consistent results, especially<br/>
with detail work.<br/>
