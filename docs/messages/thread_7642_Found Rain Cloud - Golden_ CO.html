                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am in Denver on business this week, and decided to carve out some <br/>
time to letterbox - my family's new found hobby.  I thought the <br/>
weather might get the best of me today, but the rain held out until <br/>
late evening - my lame rain dance worked!!<br/>
<br/>
After lunch I ventured out to find the Rain Cloud letterbox in <br/>
Golden, Colorado.  My New England lungs labored in these higher <br/>
altitudes, but it was a fun climb in dinosaur country.  The clues <br/>
were right on.  But still it took me a good 45 minutes to find the <br/>
box.  Once you get to the twin pines, follow the clues literally - <br/>
that's all I'll say.<br/>
<br/>
After the journey, I headed over to Red Rocks.  What a sight.  <br/>
The "Free Jam Society" had a low-volume session going on at the <br/>
amphitheater, and I sat in the last row to soak in the vibes.  Quite <br/>
a feeling on 9/11.<br/>
<br/>
Happy letterboxing everyone,<br/>
<br/>
