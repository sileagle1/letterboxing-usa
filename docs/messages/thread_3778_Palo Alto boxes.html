&gt; I was in SFO yesterday. And I hunted for the 3 letterboxes in Bol<br/>
&gt; Park in Palo Alto and came up empty handed also!!  Although I did<br/>
&gt; enjoy meeting Perry and Miner-Forty-Niner (donkeys).  I will try<br/>
&gt; Byxbee Park next time I am there, but would appreciate someone to<br/>
&gt; confirm if the boxes there are missing or not.<br/>
