It's happening!  The first Letterboxing Event in Oklahoma (correct me <br/>
if I'm wrong).  I'm trying to get a web page set up on Doug's site, <br/>
but in the meantime, here's a little info:<br/>
<br/>
     -Name- Cabin Fever Gathering<br/>
     -Date- we're shooting for is April 2, 2005<br/>
     -Time- as long as there's daylight . . .<br/>
     -Where- Dolese Youth Park, Warr Acres, OK (Near OKC)<br/>
     -RSVP at jnm4scooter at yahoo.com &amp; you can let me know what    <br/>
           you'd like to contribute to the pot-luck.<br/>
     -You can begin placing boxes in the area for the event if you<br/>
           wish (although it could be a loooong winter) &amp; e-mail  <br/>
           me the clues (so I can print out a booklet of the clues).<br/>
     -ANYONE who would like to mail a HH to me for the HH Hostel is <br/>
