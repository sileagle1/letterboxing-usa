                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to comment on your idea about a listing of rest area <br/>
boxes.  I have feelings on both sides of this one...  <br/>
<br/>
On the one hand, part of the fun of letterboxing, at least for me, is <br/>
plotting out my trip and checking out the letterbox clues for the <br/>
states I will be going through to see what may be along my route, or <br/>
worth a side trip.  In many cases, this means solving mystery clues, <br/>
at least to the point of figuring out the county they are in.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, it would be convenient for those traveling to have <br/>
such a "rest stop" box listing.  But, this doesn't necessarily have <br/>
to be integrated into the main LbNA site, adding yet more work onto <br/>
the plates of the already-overworked volunteer webmasters.  Anyone <br/>
could put together such a listing on their own personal site, with <br/>
links to the appropriate boxes on the LbNA site.  There are a handful <br/>
of sites where people list all of the boxes in a particular state or <br/>
area, even though they are not all their own boxes.<br/>
<br/>
It just takes somebody who is willing to put the time into putting <br/>
such a listing together on a web page.  <br/>
