                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well in Canada they just celebrated Thanksgiving and we can  now too <br/>
as my parents have just planted two boxes for us in Nova Scotia.  <br/>
They had to borrow a computer to email me the clues.  It is beautiful <br/>
country there for a visit and both can be done in the same day they <br/>
are in close proximity.  So Thanks Mom and Dad,  hope you enjoyed <br/>
your trip I know letterboxing appreciates your effort. I know your <br/>
Grandchildren will enjoy seeking out the boxes that started in <br/>
Connecticut  and traveled north to the land of Canada.  Happy <br/>
Thanksgiving!<br/>
