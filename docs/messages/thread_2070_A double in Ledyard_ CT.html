<br/>
Here's an easy 3 mile out-and-back hike with two easy climbs through <br/>
abandoned farmland and up a small ridge overlooking watershed. There <br/>
are two letterboxes to be found in about two hours of pleasant <br/>
walking.<br/>
<br/>
In Groton on CT Rte. 184, about 1 miles east of I-95, find a little <br/>
pull-out to park just beyond the stoplight at Gungywamp Rd and right <br/>
across from Paul's Service Center. (The Gray Rock is a fenced-in, <br/>
half-buried glacial erratic a short bit further east). The trails <br/>
here are not marked, so this rather detailed cluesheet may favor the <br/>
compass masters in your group.<br/>
<br/>
Park, then walk in towards the "No Campfires or Open Flames" sign. <br/>
Bear 150 at the first intersection and pass a mortered stone <br/>
gatepost to the ESE. Skip a little dink leading back toward the road, <br/>
then go 136 down the old farm path.<br/>
<br/>
Pass by the first right, an upside down "Y" and continue straight on <br/>
100. Then, a few steps later, go straight through the cross trail <br/>
and soon bypass a leftwards leading "Y". Walk between walls to a "T".<br/>
<br/>
Turn to 150, avoid the next right, and continue straight through <br/>
the field, a bit of forest, and another field. Go straight through a <br/>
right-turn "Y" by a campfire back into the woods.<br/>
<br/>
Turn to 084 and walk through a stone wall uphill through mountain <br/>
laurel. In thick laurel, trail splits. Go straight on 046 and <br/>
downhill to Groton City No Trespassing signs.<br/>
<br/>
Curve 270 and hike steeply uphill through erratics. At the top, the <br/>
trail curves left and then T's. Turn to 180 and in a short bit bear <br/>
left on 114 at a triple tree in rock. A short way on this footpath <br/>
brings you to a spot overlooking the Groton Reservoir (fairly hidden <br/>
when the leaves are in). There are a couple of rocks leaning on a <br/>
tree on the SE side of the trail. Look there for your first find, the <br/>
Reservoir Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Now continue south above the water through a ledgy boulder field, <br/>
skipping a faint right going 310. The trail sweeps to the southwest. <br/>
At a "Y", bear 300 to a wonderful slickrock overlook (if you come to <br/>
an almost-vertical dropoff, you've missed the "Y" turnoff). From the <br/>
highest point, find the water tower across I95 at 238. Turn around <br/>
and march straight back from there 25 steps to a ledge and find the <br/>
Slickrock Letterbox at about knee level.<br/>
<br/>
To return, retrace your way north along the reservoir bypassing <br/>
that "faint Y at 310" and bypassing the next left to find the steep <br/>
no trespassing triple trunked tree in rock intersection again. Head <br/>
305 into more laurel, and in a surprisingly short way return to a <br/>
familiar "T". Now walk 255, back downhill, through the stone wall, <br/>
and right to the campfire "Y".<br/>
<br/>
Fork 344 and pass through the field, then north at the "T". A few <br/>
steps later, turn west at the "Y. Return between walls and in quick <br/>
succession go straight west at the "Y", straight through the cross <br/>
trail, and 290 at the "Y". A simple right-left returns you to your <br/>
beginning.<br/>
