Just a couple questions, since I'm still fairly new...<br/>
<br/>
While maintaining your planted letterboxes, do any of you photocopy the logbook so you have a personal copy should something happen to the original?  I thought this might be a good idea, and also something to add to my scrapbook or a home log.  What other types of documentation do you keep for posterity?<br/>
<br/>
Do you stick to your "home area" or plant afar?  Iowa only has a couple dozen boxes, spread around the state.  I know several folks have planted boxes around the country as they travel and revisit them.  I plan to plant in other states and have family maintain them.  Was trying to find someone in Ireland (I will vacation there for a week soon, but won't frequent) to maintain, but no success.  I'll bring one - you never know if you'll strike up conversation in a pub!  Perhaps I'll find someone to addict, er, introduce to this hobby!<br/>
<br/>
THANKS!<br/>

We came across a couple of letterboxes this summer and most of the pages had been torn out.  At first I thought it had been vandalized and was very disappointed.  One of my favorite things about finding a LB is looking at the logbook.  Then we came across another logbook with pages torn out and lo and behold, it was by the same placer!  I emailed the placer who confirmed that yes, they tear out the pages to keep in their scrapbook.  Of course, it is their property to do with as they wish.  But it was very disappointing, nonetheless.<br/>

As a scrap booker, I was considering pulling old logbooks and  simply<br/>
replacing them so I would have the original.  Now, I will make sure to leave<br/>
a copy (color of course) for any subsequent visitors--you are right, I love<br/>
seeing who has visited and reading their comments.<br/>
