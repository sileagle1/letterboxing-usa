<br/>
It was just at a Borders/Barnes and Noble kind of<br/>
store. Usually book stores have little journals up<br/>
near the front of the store.<br/>
<br/>
My mom's pretty special. Plus, handmade gifts are less<br/>
money and much more valuable.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, it's sortof an extention of an identity.<br/>
Something you'd do with a logo if you were to present<br/>
it to a client, like "here's your logo on a book, as a<br/>
watermark, as a stamp". I went to school for that sort<br/>
of thing, though haven't made it to a real career yet.<br/>
So all my friends get really creative presents.<br/>

I did this for our 2 babysitters,too! I must say the stamps I carved <br/>
them (after picking thier mother's brain for favorite things) are <br/>
100% better than my own signature stamp!I handmade journals and <br/>
included local clues.<br/>
<br/>
They just returned from vacation and I can't wait to give it to them!<br/>
<br/>
Didn't think to include the book, hmmm, maybe I can pick up a copy <br/>
soon!<br/>
