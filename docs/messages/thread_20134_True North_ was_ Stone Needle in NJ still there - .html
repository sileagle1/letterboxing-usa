For people who aren't like me I'll admit it's sometimes better to <br/>
have it shown to you rather then just reading directions.  That might <br/>
be a good activity for a gathering.  I'd be glad to conduct a lesson <br/>
if there's a gathering in my area of MW NJ.  I have plenty of maps as <br/>
I've done most of the mapping for the Nordic ski Patrol in High Point <br/>

BTW, I like letterboxing, but I'm not as active since it's not as <br/>
much of a change or novelty for me.  I'm often searching for things <br/>
in the woods.  I love exploring with Map, compass and now my GPS.  <br/>

Hey, if you're offering, count me in.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Let's slow down with the guns.  I can't tell the intent of the question raised, but knowing there are other people out there besides me who weren't born using a compass, it could have been a genuinely serious question. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt.  Plenty of people have been confused here on this issue in the past, and not all the info. that's out there about compass reading and declination is well-written or easy to understand.  So, for people who are still confused by this topic (declination, True North, etc.) and/or by this conversation.... here's my simple explanation. :o)  Most letterbox planters in this country use Magnetic North when giving compass readings in clues, meaning the finders do not need to think about angles of declination (adjustments made to the compass reading depending on where on the globe the box is).  And if the compass readings do not specify True North or Magnetic North, we are to assume Magnetic North.  However, if as in this Stone Needle box, the planter has mentioned True North or given the declination as this planter did, the finders need to make the given adjustments or find out what the angle of declination is so they can compensate for it. <br/>
<br/>
The reason for all this is that the earth has a True North pole, which is not the same as its magnetic North.  A compass will show you Magnetic North, but if you need to find True North, you need to know where you are on the globe and compensate by adding or subtracting degrees from the compass reading. If you are using a map together with your compass to head towards certain landmarks, you would need to know angles of declination as well... unless you simply need to reach something like a river that you really can't miss even if your direction is off by 10 degrees or so. <br/>
<br/>
I personally think it's kind of fun to learn these things, and I like it that I now know our angle of declination.  So I'm glad there are both kinds of clues out there.  But I could be a real freak. I can understand if some people's brains just feel cluttered up by this kind of knowledge.  If so, they can always ask for help or skip that kind of letterbox.  And if this explanation too is clear as mud, here's a website that I liked a lot, and this URL will take you directly to the declination page:   http://www.learn-orienteeering.org/old/lesson3.html .  The site itself is called "Kjetil Kjernsmo's illustrated guide on How to Use a Compass." Someone here told me about it. The compass in the illustrations looks like a Suunto.   My Suunto compass also has similar explanations, and a map showing the basic declinations.  PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong, or if you can think of simpler explanations. --lunaryakketyact <br/>
