                    <div class="plaintext-content">On February 26, 2003 the Manu Make Letterboxes, were placed near Kula on the island of Maui, Hawaii. This <br/>
hike is about 4 miles roundtrip through forest and meadow, past grottoes and pahoehoe streambeds. More <br/>
than 70 species of endemic Hawaiian birds have been documented over the last two centuries. Two thirds of <br/>
these unique species have since become extinct. Today, two of the unique Hawaiian Honeycreepers can only <br/>
be found in these letterboxes. This Nimble-Pig Collaboration allows you to add them to your life list.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: from the Hana Highway head mauka on the Haleakala Highway 37 toward Kula. At the SECOND <br/>
intersection with route 377 turn left. Go .4 miles to the first right turn, Waipoli Road. Turn here and go 5.4 miles <br/>
on a narrow winding road to the hunters' check station and park beside the road. Walk down the rough, dirt <br/>
jeep track to the right of the station. The Waiakoa Loop trailhead is at the end of this road.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To the letterboxes: Go left at the first fork in the Waiakoa Loop trail. About fifty steps beyond the 2.5 mile <br/>
marker the earth will yawn to your right, a lava ledge as its upper lip. The Mamo Letterbox lives within this <br/>
earthy grin behind bark and sticks.(box by Funhog)<br/>
<br/>
Continue on the Loop until you reach a trail junction. Between the trails high and low, the Akialoa Letterbox <br/>
rests beneath silver grain, roots to the right. (box by Legerdemaine)<br/>

was kama'aina. It was cool but there was enough up and down to work up<br/>
a sweat. We were in the clouds most of the hike and our hair was<br/>
dripping from the condensation but plenty warm. <br/>
<br/>
I, too have worn fleece up on Haleakala but this is enough lower that<br/>
neither of us put on the jacket we brought with us. I hope you get a<br/>
chance to search out these boxes. Nimble-Pig strikes again! Funhog<br/>
