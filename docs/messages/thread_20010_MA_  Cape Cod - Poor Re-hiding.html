<br/>
I am disturbed to hear about the boxes you found "tossed on the <br/>
ground".  I was just on Cape Cod two weeks ago and found Glassworks <br/>
well hidden and checked on my three boxes.  Of course I rehid them <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell me if these four we among the "tossed on the ground" <br/>
group?  If so what is your sig stamp like?  I would like to have a <br/>
relative check one of the boxes and try to identify who the previous <br/>
stamp was so I can politely write them.  As a community we need to <br/>
see if we can identify these people and try to educate them before <br/>
we lose our work.<br/>
<br/>
That said I am delighted you found The Empty Tomb.  I hope you <br/>
enjoyed the difference between my early crude work and my new tomb <br/>
stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting out there,<br/>

&gt; Hello all!  Being a teacher means a limitied amount of time left <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; the "marathon" letterboxing days and I wanted to make 100 by the <br/>
end <br/>
&gt; of the summer.  With yesterday's jaunt to Cape Cod, I made my goal <br/>
&gt; and now 200 looms on the horizon!  FYI-Box 100 was the second in <br/>
&gt; Greg's "Briar Patch" series in East Sandwich. Ya-Hoo!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All of the boxes that we found were in great shape...definitely <br/>
NOT <br/>
&gt; re-hidden well (can we say just tossed on the ground??) but well, <br/>
&gt; otherwise. Here's a list....<br/>
&gt; ~Herring Run by Mary Manatee in Bourne (also Swan Song HH resting <br/>
&gt; here)<br/>
&gt; ~Belmont Rock by Mary Manatee in Bourne <br/>
&gt; ~The Glassworks by Mary Manatee in Sagamore<br/>
&gt; ~Briar Patch by Greg in East Sandwich<br/>
&gt; ~Oyster-ville by Scarab in Osterville<br/>
&gt; ~Winged Death's Head by Scarab in Osterville<br/>
&gt; ~The Empty Tomb by Scarab in Osterville<br/>
&gt; ~Railroad Bridge by DragonFly in Bourne<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We also tried to get The Anchorage by Mary Manatee and the <br/>
Yachtsman <br/>
&gt; but no one near us knew where the pavilion at Scusset was and we <br/>
&gt; couldn't tell.  There is also a non-waiverable $10 parking fee at <br/>
&gt; the Sandwich boardwalk, so we didn't end up getting The Phantom, <br/>
&gt; either.  Other than that, we really enjoyed our day on the Cape.  <br/>
&gt; Thanks to all of the 'boxers who place out there!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy trails,<br/>
