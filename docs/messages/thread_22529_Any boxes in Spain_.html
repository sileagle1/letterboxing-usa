Hey Rubaduc,<br/>
Que Paso! If you go to Atlas Quest message boards and click on World <br/>
Letterboxing the go to Spain you will see Amanda has a link listed.<br/>
Also Sierra Sally out of Dinuba, California is going to Spain and <br/>
Portugal and will be leaving some letterboxes I'm fairly sure. You can <br/>
probably find her via the LbNCA or SoCal lists.<br/>
If you plant any over there I would suggest you use "Spain" in the <br/>
title. We planted 3 in Sweden last year and they can be found through <br/>
a search at LBNA by just using "Sweden" in the search words because we <br/>
kept using it in the titles. It helps to google them also.<br/>
