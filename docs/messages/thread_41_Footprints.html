&gt;  Funny thing happening here over the past 4 months since the flood, huge<br/>
&gt;  sasquatch style footprints have appeared (painted) on sidewalks and road<br/>
&gt;  crossing.  Yesterday, a set of baby prints appeared.  Any ideas on<br/>
&gt;  incorporating the prints in a latterbox?  Do you think the flood washed<br/>
&gt;  "IT" out of a hibernation?<br/>
<br/>

As you may know, Oregon, like Vermont, is Bigfoot country.  As soon as I read<br/>
your message, I headed for the forest to consult some of the Yeti-folk about<br/>
this phenomenon.  After travelling many miles into the woods and speaking to<br/>
several sasquatches, I was finally able to confirm that, indeed, the recent<br/>
floods in your area caused a great deal of damage to some of the big guys'<br/>
caves.  The very visible painted footprints you've seen are an attempt to<br/>
increase awareness of their plight, in hopes that curious humans will wander<br/>
into the woods carrying much-needed knapsacks of food and other supplies.<br/>
They suggested that a series of letterboxes with various sized footprint<br/>
stamps hidden in wooded areas might lure enough people into the territory of<br/>
the huge hairy humanoids to keep them supplied during this time of rebuilding.<br/>
"Be sure and hide the boxes far into the forest," one of the smelly feller's<br/>
recommended, "so people will be tempted to take picnic lunches with them."<br/>

Well, I asked them... but they insisted that  (1) There are no ties long<br/>
enough to go around their huge hairy necks,  (2) They aren't very fond of<br/>
ties... too much like a leash, and (3) a white table cloth doesn't sound like<br/>
a very appetizing dinner entree.<br/>
<br/>
They did offer to attend, however, if you should instead decide to serve<br/>
fresh-caught raw salmon and wild blackberries in the forest sometime.  Ties<br/>
are out of the question, but they did mention that they would consider taking<br/>
a dip in the stream before dinner, to settle down the dust and fleas in their<br/>
fur... a pretty civilized offer, coming from a sasquatch.<br/>

My 14-year-old is in size 15's.  Not very civilized at all.  Maybe he's<br/>
lonesome for his kin--not many Sasquatches around Texas that I know of...<br/>
