                    <div class="plaintext-content">On Saturday, I discovered the following letterboxes:<br/>
<br/>
Into the Woods, Hoffman Park -- the box was fine, as was the journal and <br/>
stamp in their plastic bag, but there was moisture inside the box and the <br/>
"about letterboxing" cards were soaked and could use replacing. Also, the <br/>
clues refer to 2 birch stumps, but only one is standing -- the other has <br/>
rotted away completely. The stump where the box is hidden is also rotting <br/>
away quickly. This box is little visited, but the clues should probably be <br/>
slightly revised. (The poison ivy was ubiquitous, but I trod carefully and <br/>
*so far* don't seem to have brought any home with me <g>).<br/>
<br/>
Ken Lockwood Gorge -- in fine shape.<br/>
<br/>
Round Valley -- in good shape, and I picked up the Backpacker Hitchhiker <br/>
there, too. This hitchhiker seems happy to have finally gotten out of New <br/>
England (it had been found multiple times by various 'boxers, including 4 <br/>
times by Wanda &amp; Pete) and wants to go further west. I'll be happy to <br/>
oblige <g>.<br/>
