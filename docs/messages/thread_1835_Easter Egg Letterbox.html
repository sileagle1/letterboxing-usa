the Easter Egg Letterbox. Surprised, I was, to find 1 stamp from Atlanta and<br/>
(counting mine) 2 from New England.<br/>
I also discovered a new letterbox enthusiast. He lives in Sacramento, CA. He<br/>
signed in at the Easter Egg box, because being brand new he did not have a<br/>
stamp. He also pulled up the web site, found several boxes near his home,<br/>
vowed to find them, and was talking about placing boxes in and around the<br/>
coast of California, on off coast islands, and in Hawaii (Oahu) this summer.<br/>
Looks like we will be able to add Hawaii to our list of states soon.<br/>
Sorry I missed the gathering, but I was 1500 miles away.<br/>
