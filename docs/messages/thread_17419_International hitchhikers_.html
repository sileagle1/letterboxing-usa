<br/>
My wife and I recently picked up a hitchhiker in Virginia, and plan to place it in a new location soon. We're planning a vacation to another country this month, and I had remember in the past seeing that there is a letterbox located at our destination.  We'd like to take our little friend with us and leave him in the letterbox, but when I checked the clue sheets of the "new" letterboxing site, I couldn't find the clues that I had remembered.  As I poked around, I found that most of the clues for the areas of interest (think South America/Mexican/Caribbean locations) aren't available on the new site. I'm assuming that this is because people who plant international boxes while traveling can't really maintain them, and the boxes might therefore be considered abandoned.  <br/>
<br/>
The specific clues that I had remembered are still available on the old letterboxing site, however.<br/>
<br/>
Our problem, therefore, is this.  If we do indeed place our hitchhiking friend in the international box (assuming it's still there), we're afraid that he will languish there for all eternity, as anyone who looks for clues on the new site will not find anything listed.<br/>
<br/>
Should we place our friend somewhere else, or let him free in his southern home?  Will the international clues be eventually placed on the new site?  Is there a place on the new site that holds these clues and, if so, do people regularly check this location for clues?<br/>
<br/>
Any feedback is appreciated, as we're leaving in a couple of weeks, and would hate to drop him off if the chances are slim that he'll ever again be found (BTW, the area we're heading to is a fairly well visited tourist location, not the middle of a jungle somewhere, so he'll probably be found again if the clues are available).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any advice.<br/>

I would suggest that you ask the owner of the hitchhiker -- they may or may <br/>
not like the idea of their plant ending up in a rarely-visited box in <br/>
another country. The problem is that once the hitchhiker is outside the <br/>
U.S., it would likely never end up back here again.<br/>
<br/>
You might take along the hitchhiker for the ride and stamp it into the <br/>
international box (and vice versa), then bring it back to the U.S. But the <br/>
overriding rule about hitchhikers is that they're supposed to keep moving, <br/>
so holding onto one just to have one to place in some special future <br/>
letterbox is kinda defeating the purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you create a hitchhiker of your own and start its journey in the <br/>
international box, assuming that it's still there and you can find it?<br/>

I like the idea about taking it along to stamp in, but actually <br/>
leaving it in a box stateside that's more likely to be visited.  We <br/>
did want to make sure the HH kept moving so that the creator could <br/>
get regular updates as to its progress.<br/>
<br/>
I'll drop a line to the HH's parent and see what they think.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your input.<br/>

of the boxes were no longer on the letterboxing.org site since no one had<br/>
claimed the box.  As an "abandoned" box the clues had been moved to the<br/>
"basement" portion of the site.  Since we knew the box was still in<br/>
existence, we decided to adopt the box to get the clues back on the main<br/>
site.  We added a note to the clues that we would be happy if a local<br/>
letterboxer would adopt it since we wouldn't be able to check on it. Even<br/>
though we won't be able to maintain it (at least not very often!), we<br/>
decided it was more fun to make the box clues available to other vacationers<br/>
rather than let it disappear.<br/>

You may want to consider adopting the box if you find it, so others can<br/>
still access the clues.<br/>
