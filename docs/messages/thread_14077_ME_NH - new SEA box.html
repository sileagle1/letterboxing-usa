us... Phyto and Isosceles finally found the SEAHORSE box after coming <br/>
to the Fort another time and searching high and low in the late <br/>
evening. Today it was much busier and we had to stamp discretely! <br/>
Left a new log book for the box as the other one was really getting <br/>
full and the pages had completely fallen out and were rubber banded.<br/>
<br/>
After Kittery we decided that Portsmouth was such a close drive... <br/>
There is a new Mystery box in that area called SEASONG, the clue is <br/>
very precise, but still short - hope you have fun with that one!<br/>
<br/>
After an extended visit to that area we attempted 1 of the 2 boxes at <br/>
Great Bay NERR, and was unable to find TAKE REFUGE 1 - missing? I <br/>
felt it was on a part of the restricted trail - not as though that <br/>
has ever stopped me before, but being in unfamiliar area, it is wise <br/>
to respect the park rules/signs/gates -no?<br/>
<br/>
We stamped into SEACOAST2 and GOLDEN PEGASUS only to find HERE COMES <br/>
THE TICKS HH which was very exciting as this is our first one. We <br/>
brought it back with us to Maine and it will probably surface for the <br/>
gathering in August. Looks as though it's already seen the Gerbil <br/>
Gathering earlier!!! It's great to put stamps with some of the names <br/>
on the list (finally)...and to get a sneak peak at boxes in CT. Can't <br/>
believe it passed through Torrington - used to live there! <br/>
<br/>
Finished up the day at the ADAMS POINT box/cache. Great meadow full <br/>
of dragonflies and damsels and other assorted bugs and wildlife. This <br/>
box is part geocache, and from the looks of the log, not too many <br/>
boxers have stamped into this one- the stamp is a small eraser, but <br/>
it's nice and I cringed reading through the log as I read that some <br/>
people were replacing the box and moving it...it is my understanding <br/>
that wouldn't be good for a gps unit - although it's not totally <br/>
exact, I wouldn't want to move the coordinates of the original place.<br/>
<br/>
Ah well- all in all FUN DAY on the SEAcoast! Won't be boxing for <br/>
several weeks. Look for the TICKS HH traveling through Maine. Finally-<br/>
What is the procedure for a filled HH logbook? Do you replace kindly <br/>
as a courtesy to the placer? <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
