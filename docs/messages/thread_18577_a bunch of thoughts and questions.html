In my 3 years of experience, I have found (by finding a variety of <br/>
different types of HHs) that the smaller the HH, the better.  Use a <br/>
logbook that is smaller than the traditional size 3X5 spiral bound <br/>
index card deck, and try to find or make a stamp that is no larger <br/>
than the logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Why?  The smaller the HH, the more it will travel.  I can't tell you <br/>
how many times I have found HHs with the 3X5 log, and can't replant <br/>
it in the next few boxes I find because there simply is no room in <br/>
the letterbox container to hold both the original letterbox contents <br/>
*and* the HH.  The smaller, the flatter, the better.  Here in New <br/>
England, letterboxes tend to be small, and fit into tight hiding <br/>
places.<br/>
<br/>
But here's the fun part.  *There are no rules*  You can make your HH <br/>
any way you please, and let the finder take up the challenge of <br/>
replanting!  We love challenges!<br/>
<br/>
Regarding labeling - when you write the name of the HH on the log <br/>
book, simply write "(insert name here) HH".  You may also want to <br/>
label the outermost plastic ziplock the same way.  Trust me.  We <br/>
letterboxers know *exactly* what to do with them when we find them!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I guess it would be pretty obvious if you placed it in someone <br/>
else's box, but what if one wanted to start one in their own box?  Is <br/>
that legit?<br/>
<br/>
Assume the zen lotus position and chant along with me - "there are no <br/>
rules...there are no rules...there are no rules..." ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this, but I have two <br/>
interpretations:<br/>
<br/>
1.  You want to start a HH with its *own* plastic (or whatever) box?  <br/>
Size is the issue here again.  I've seen lots of HHs in their own <br/>
box, sometimes a microbox inside a film canister, sometimes in a <br/>
sandwich sized rubbermaid container.  It is doable (heck, <br/>
letterboxers are pretty creative folks), but the challenge is where <br/>
to replant it.  Depending on where you hunt for LBs, there may be <br/>
plenty of room in the hiding spot for the original LB and the extra <br/>
container HH.  Or not.  But like I said, we like challenges!<br/>
<br/>
2.  You want to launch a HH in one of your own established permanent <br/>
letterboxes.  Heck, I do that all the time!  In fact, I made a <br/>
deliberate choice of location for one particular permanent LB of mine <br/>
that is a hitchhiker magnet because the hiding place could hold three <br/>
normal sized letterboxes!  A few more of my permanent boxes have the <br/>
larger type of container (rectangular) so they can accommodate even <br/>
the larger 3X5 logbook type HH.  (Okay, okay, I confess - I made <br/>
these special larger hiding places/larger containers on purpose <br/>
because I found myself carrying around larger sized HHs for weeks on <br/>
end (tsk! tsk!) because in my travels I could not find a place to <br/>
replant them.  So now I have a failsafe - if all else fails, I <br/>
replant the larger HHs in these larger LBs of my own.  Okay, my <br/>
secret is out!)<br/>
<br/>
I hope this post has made you laugh, given you some tips, reinforced <br/>
the "there are no rules" philosophy, and given you the boost to "go <br/>
for it".<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing,<br/>

&gt; RE: #6 plastic...Werewulf, what's the shrink-down rate?  Half size?<br/>

<br/>
I'm with Barbie.. math is hard.<br/>
<br/>
Just measured.  My original piece of plastic was about 2.5 by 3.75 inches and very skinny <br/>
and flexible.  My shrunken piece is about 1.25 by 2 inches, about an eight of an inch thick <br/>
and rigid.<br/>
<br/>
In Girl Scouts we use sharpie markers to decorate the plastic, so I'm guessing (without <br/>
having actually tried yet) that you could rub a sharpie over your stamp and then stamp <br/>
onto the plastic.  That's my plan anyway.<br/>
<br/>
