Exeter, RI<br/>

<br/>
<b>Rating:</b>  easy 15 minute uphill trail, rocky footing<br/>
<br/>
<b>Driving directions:</b>  from rt.165 in Exeter turn south onto Mt. Tom Road.  Follow about 0.7 mile to trailhead parking on left, next to the brook.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Clues:</b>  Cross the road and follow the white blazed Mt. Tom Trail up the hill.  Climb the rocky ledge following the white blazes to where the view opens up.  At the arrow go left so that you can really enjoy the vistas to the east, south and west.  Return to the arrow and follow the trail north along the ledge.  When the trail turns to the right around the tallest boulder yet, and the footing goes from ledge to rocky gravel, stop.  There is an oak tree with a white blaze in front of you to the left.  The highest boulder is on your right.  Views to the west are behind you.  That which you seek is nigh.  Behind your left shoulder, there is a knee high boulder about five feet across.  It is covered in lichen and brown fungus.  There is a small birch tree growing on the west side.  It sits on top of a larger knee high boulder.  Don't let it catch you "acting the goat".<br/>
    If the trail descends more than 20 feet, you have gone to far.<br/>
