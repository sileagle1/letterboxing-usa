weekend and found the following letterboxes in Mystic in good shape:  <br/>
DNPC -- Series One -- all boxes; Denison Pequotsepos Wildlife Series<br/>
#1:  Joe Pyeweed.  We also visited the Drewclan's "Birdhouse"<br/>
letterbox.  It was missing a log book, which had been removed because<br/>
it was wet.  We added a new, dry log book and a new bag to (hopefully)<br/>
keep it dry.  Some folks had stamped in on pieces of letterboxing<br/>
instructions that they had brought with them.  We left those in the<br/>
box also.<br/>
<br/>
What a muggy, buggy day yesterday!  One of these days we'll go boxing<br/>
in good weather again!<br/>
