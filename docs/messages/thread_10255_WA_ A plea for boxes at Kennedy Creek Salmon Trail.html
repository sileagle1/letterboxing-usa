                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey all you South Sounders out there, Bethany, Bill and Evil Glenn, <br/>
Fudrick, Hoopoe, Tea Thyme and Thunder, I have an urgent request.  My <br/>
10 year old (Garrett-G-Man) is going to be advancing from Webelos II <br/>
to Boy Scouts this month and his pack (3 boys total)have a required <br/>
hike planned for the 25th.  They are planning to visit the Kennedy <br/>
Creek Salmon Trail between Shelton and Olympia. I introduced the idea <br/>
of letterboxing to the pack leader and he and the other parents were <br/>
very excited about it. We want to incorporate letterboxing into the <br/>
hike but we, the Nail Family, unfortunately, do not have the time <br/>
(pinewood derby this weekend, other boy's activities throughout the <br/>
week) to get out there and plant any boxes prior to the hike.  <br/>
<br/>
Thats why I ask for your help.  Could one or a few of you great <br/>
SSound letterboxing folks help us out by making some quick boxes to <br/>
place on the trail so these boys can enjoy their hike even more?  It <br/>
would be greatly appreciated.  We would even provide the rubber <br/>
erasers, log books, and gladware if needed.  <br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to a website that gives lots of info about Kennedy <br/>
Creek Salmon Trail. <br/>
<br/>
http://www.wa.gov/wdfw/fish/chum/viewingchum_kennedy.htm <br/>
<br/>
I think you would agree, this site is just begging for boxes.  Maybe <br/>
we could all work together to get some new boxes into Mason County <br/>
and recruit a few more boys (and parents) into the sport.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you all think.<br/>

<br/>
That is if I return from Evil Glenns new Pt Defiance boxes<br/>
<br/>
It will be a pleasure.<br/>
