Page:<br/>
<br/>
"Forest Park: You Light Up My Life"<br/>
St. Louis, MO<br/>
<br/>
Sit at the North end of the lagoon with Samuel Hauck. Reminisce with the good <br/>
doctor about old times at the World's Fair.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine the Art Museum in its awesome appearance and glory during The Fair.<br/>
If you find it hard to picture the History Museum and the Boat Dock can help <br/>
you!<br/>
<br/>
When you tire of your chat and of watching the ducks, a decision must be <br/>
made. Which way to travel on Lagoon Drive?<br/>
<br/>
Left? Right? East? West?<br/>
<br/>
No Fear!  St. Louie, himself is pointing the way!<br/>
<br/>
You won't walk too far before crossing  a gap but in obvious Art Deco Style! <br/>
~ 0.2 miles.<br/>
<br/>
(You will even notice a small suspension bridge to the South! But we are not <br/>
interested in that!)<br/>
<br/>
Cross to the NW Side of the road.<br/>
<br/>
Walk around the East wing and parapet wall.<br/>
<br/>
What a neat place this was once -- a natural rock lined creek and decorative <br/>
bridge.<br/>
<br/>
Keep walking northward. Before reaching the next little golf cart bridge <br/>
there is an opening in the brush!<br/>
<br/>
You'll find the box in a crevice of the East bank approximately 6 feet south <br/>
of the two tall Bass Trees. Yes, it would have been more appropriate to hide <br/>
this container near the Jewel Box.<br/>
<br/>
Please carefully wedge it back into place and lay a slab or two in front of <br/>
it to keep it safe during high water.<br/>
<br/>
There is not room for a cache in this one but for the GPS coordinates or to <br/>
see who has logged into this box please <br/>
click here --&gt;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.asp?ID=4751<br/>
<br/>
PS. I am depending on you to keep my first box safe.  Please close all <br/>
ziplocks carefully and carefully replace her.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
