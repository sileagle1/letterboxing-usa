After weeks of not doing much boxing, Psychokiwi #2 and I got off our behinds<br/>
and got outdoors. Saturday we went on an elephant safari (thanks Chuck for<br/>
such a cute series!) and Sunday we went searching for birds and butterflies.<br/>
We were delighted to finally PFX=500, and did so in style with a beautiful<br/>
Drewclan butterfly kiss (what a gorgeous set of stamps Jay!!!). We've also had<br/>
fun "P-ing," and will hopefully have some more boxes out soon.<br/>
<br/>
We also bumped into Pat &amp; Amy, Sadie &amp; Russ, and Chuck, Molly, &amp; Chickabirdee<br/>
on the trails. Was fun catching up with you all. <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
