As for other things, I've encountered snakes on trails, but just<br/>
stomping your foot on the ground nearby (but not too close) to the snake<br/>
usually moves them along.  They generally just mind their own business<br/>
and don't want encounters with humans as a general rule, in my<br/>
experience.<br/>

<br/>
Last weekend as I was hunting for a letterbox hidden within a stone <br/>
wall in Tobiasson Memorial Forest in Tolland, CT, I came upon a large <br/>
black and yellow snake (I would say it had a diameter of 1 1/4 to 1/2 <br/>
inches) curled up under a stone. <br/>
<br/>
Not long ago, someone who found one of my letterboxes in Wendell State <br/>
Forest, Mass., sent me an email about their adventure, which included <br/>
accidentally disturbing a hornet's nest and getting stung.  There was <br/>
no hornet's nest near the box when I hid it several years ago, but I <br/>
can't vouch for what the hornets are up to this summer!<br/>
<br/>
Just two examples...<br/>

It sounds like a fairly straightforward act of journalism. You're simply<br/>
asking people if they'll tell you a story and give you premission to print<br/>
it. Some may ask for names to be changed. It's unlikely to raise any great<br/>
ethical issues, I'd say, as long as they are fully informed about what you<br/>
intend to do with their words. A lawyer would probably advise you to get a<br/>
signed release from all concerned, but frankly, if they don't want you to<br/>
use their story, they won't tell it to you.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Tim...I have been thinking.... if I were to<br/>
&gt; decide to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;put together a book of letterboxing stories,<br/>
&gt; where<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;would I stand, in terms of using other people's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;stories in a perhaps profitable venture?  Would I<br/>
&gt; need<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;to get their permission?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  If so, how binding would it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;be?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm not sure what you mean by this.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I am working on a fiction novel at this time, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;my stuff is my own.  I'd love to do a<br/>
&gt; letterboxing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;book full of stories from those of us who may<br/>
&gt; have had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;an exciting, scary, whatever adventure while<br/>
&gt; planting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;and/or finding.  However, I am wondering.....<br/>
&gt; what are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;your thoughts on this?  Thanks, Linda<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It sounds like a fairly straightforward act of<br/>
&gt; journalism. You're simply<br/>
&gt; &gt; asking people if they'll tell you a story and give<br/>
&gt; you premission to print<br/>
&gt; &gt; it. Some may ask for names to be changed. It's<br/>
&gt; unlikely to raise any great<br/>
&gt; &gt; ethical issues, I'd say, as long as they are fully<br/>
&gt; informed about what you<br/>
&gt; &gt; intend to do with their words. A lawyer would<br/>
&gt; probably advise you to get a<br/>
&gt; &gt; signed release from all concerned, but frankly, if<br/>
&gt; they don't want you to<br/>
&gt; &gt; use their story, they won't tell it to you.<br/>

Actually this is not  a new plot. Some of us more paranoid types <br/>
(including me) have sincerely worried about (and discussed) the <br/>
possibility of some disturbed person booby trapping a letterbox since <br/>
the first days of US letterboxing. In fact, I believe there was an <br/>
article on the web I read once talking about the popularity of <br/>
geocaching and how it would come crashing down one day if that were <br/>
to happen with a geocache box. Not a pleasant thought and hopefully <br/>
one that will never come to pass. Personally I hope the fiction story <br/>
proposed is never written, it may bring unwanted attention from <br/>
disturbed individuals. But then, I am a forensic psychologist who <br/>
deals with disturbed criminals most every day and tend to worry more <br/>
about such things.<br/>

I think a collection of stories would be interesting. For several <br/>
months I have had a topic on my Letterboxing International site for <br/>
people to submit their stories if they wish. So far only Dennis <br/>
Williams has submitted a story. Anyone is welcome to do so at any <br/>
time. Perhaps you may have more response than I have seen thus far. <br/>
Best wishes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for replying, Eric.  I will give it a try.  If<br/>
I get no electronic responses, I will have to see what<br/>
I can gather at meetings (I have not been to one yet).<br/>
 It may not fly.  The fiction buffs have been having<br/>
fun with the notion, though!  :-)  Linda<br/>

&gt; &gt;Eric, I more than appreciate your concern.  There<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt;a lot of creepy people "out there."  I am not a<br/>
&gt; horror<br/>
&gt; &gt;or mystery writer.  Heck, I haven't even been<br/>
&gt; &gt;published!  (yet;-)  I wouldn't be able to do that<br/>
&gt; &gt;genre justice.  However, I would dearly love to do<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt;collection of letterboxers' stories.  That would be<br/>
&gt; &gt;such fun.  The idea is incubating in my brain at<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt;point, but if I thought that I could gather enough<br/>
&gt; &gt;bits and pieces to pull it off, I would love to<br/>
&gt; give<br/>
&gt; &gt;'er a go!  What are your thoughts?  I have also<br/>
&gt; &gt;wondered about gathering stories from the points of<br/>
&gt; &gt;origin of this hobby.  A trip to merry old England<br/>
&gt; &gt;would be a great diversion!  AND, think about how<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt;"F" number would increase!  :-)  Linda<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Linda,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think a collection of stories would be<br/>
&gt; interesting. For several <br/>
&gt; months I have had a topic on my Letterboxing<br/>
&gt; International site for <br/>
&gt; people to submit their stories if they wish. So far<br/>
&gt; only Dennis <br/>
&gt; Williams has submitted a story. Anyone is welcome to<br/>
&gt; do so at any <br/>
&gt; time. Perhaps you may have more response than I have<br/>
&gt; seen thus far. <br/>
&gt; Best wishes.<br/>
&gt; -- <br/>

The potential here is unbounded.  Like a coffee table book<br/>
about coffee tables that is in fact a coffee table itself,<br/>
one could imagine stories about hunting real letterboxes<br/>
that cleverly unravel into real letterbox clues themselves, <br/>
and so on and so on ...<br/>
