<br/>
We planted this series yesterday at our favorite after-work hiking spot.  We hope you like it!  If you give it a try, please let us know what you think.<br/>

Planted By: Morgan's Family<br/>

Rated: Easy to Moderate<br/>
<br/>
Approximately 2 miles total, taking approximately an hour or so to complete.<br/>

These Boxes are at Case Mountain in Manchester, CT - Hartford County.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To get to Case Mountain take 84 East to 384.  Take Exit #4 and take a right at the end of the ramp onto Spring Street.  You will encounter a narrow road with an even narrower bridge so please drive slowly in this area.  Park on the left after the bridge.  You can gauge how busy it is by looking at the amount of cars here (you may even need to park on the street).  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Case Mt. is a very busy and popular area, utilized by both hikers/walkers and mountain bikers.  Because of this please watch for oncoming riders; and when you stamp in, do so off of the trail and as "stealthily" as possible, and please re-hide the boxes well - there is the potential for non 'boxers to find boxes in this area.<br/>
