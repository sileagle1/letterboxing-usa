Cedar Rapids is the largest city in Linn county and has several unique features.  Like Paris, France, our city government is located on an island.  Cedar Rapids is home to the largest cereal factory in the world-Quaker Oats.  In addition, we have the only urban trout stream in Iowa.  It is near this trout stream, McLoud Run, that the letterbox has been placed.  Questions or comments about the letterbox may be addressed to lmcgrew@cr.k12.ia.us.  <br/>

MCLOUD RUN LETTERBOX<br/>
By the Wright PACT Students<br/>
<br/>
Start at the Wright School parking lot<br/>
If it is chilly, or if it is hot.<br/>
This is the part where you take your car;<br/>
Do not worry, you won't go far.  OR<br/>
You can drive or ride your bike,<br/>
But then you'll have a little hike.<br/>
<br/>
Go west on Hollywood Boulevard.<br/>
You won't see any stars, <br/>
But you will see cars.<br/>
<br/>
On Center Point Road don't take a right<br/>
Or getting lost will be your plight.<br/>
Turn left to continue your journey's might.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on down Center Point Road.<br/>
Don't worry, you won't meet a toad.<br/>
<br/>
Turn right after the family foot place;<br/>
To the west you must turn your face.<br/>
<br/>
Park your car in the lot.<br/>
You won't be resting<br/>
So don't bring a cot.<br/>
Park in the lot (to the left) made of gravel.<br/>
On the gray path (to the south) you must travel.<br/>
<br/>
Take the McLoud Run Entrance to the Cedar River Trail.<br/>
Go under the overpass and you won't fail.<br/>
<br/>
You'll see a creek to your left, not your right.<br/>
See some rapids-the water puts up a fight.<br/>
<br/>
You'll see an old tree stump and a train bridge.<br/>
Step to the left and stand on the ridge.<br/>
You can stop to look for trout galore,<br/>
Then you must walk a long way more.<br/>
<br/>
Go on a pigtail, or a U-turn;<br/>
Don't go too fast or you'll crash and burn.<br/>
(Go over the bridge and around the pigtail.<br/>
If the creek moves to your right, you're on the right trail.)<br/>
<br/>
Sixty paces from under the bridge<br/>
Turn right on the trail with a little ridge.<br/>
<br/>
Keep on going straight ahead,<br/>
Along this path you must tread.<br/>
<br/>
Keep on goin' and keep on pacin'<br/>
You'll see to the left a drainage basin.<br/>
<br/>
Come to where the path divides.<br/>
Watch out-tree down ahead-not to the sides.<br/>
<br/>
Right is the path you need to take;<br/>
Thirty-seven paces you need to make.<br/>
<br/>
Look to the left and you will see<br/>
A dead moss-covered fallen tree.<br/>
<br/>
This tree points east toward the asphalt path.<br/>
Use compass skills, but you won't need math.<br/>
<br/>
Peek inside the hollow trunk's hole;<br/>
See the letterbox----Behold!<br/>
<br/>
If you have finished and found the box,<br/>
Continue on to the park for convenience-LOTS!<br/>
(Water to drink and a "porta pot.")<br/>
