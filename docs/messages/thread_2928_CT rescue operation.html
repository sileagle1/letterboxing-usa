                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last night I went to check on my Stoddard Hill box<br/>
(CT) and found it missing.  I eventually found the<br/>
pieces of it, which had been thrown over the cliff. <br/>
After doing a little rock climbing :-) I was able to<br/>
retrieve all the pieces.  The lid was off the box, but<br/>
the interior contents were still in the sealed plastic<br/>
bag, so nothing was ruined.  I put it back in<br/>
basically the same place, but I shoved it further back<br/>
under the overhang of the big rock (clues still read<br/>
the same).  I put a couple of small rocks on top of<br/>
it, and then threw some leaves and sticks over it.<br/>
<br/>
I was happy to see that it had had several visitors<br/>
(including a hitchhiker!) before it got vandalized.<br/>
<br/>
Question, to those of you who are more experienced at<br/>
hiding boxes than I am:<br/>
Do you think I should move it to a different place (in<br/>
the same park) since vandals know about it?  Or is it<br/>
safe now that I have put it further back under the<br/>
edge of the big rock?<br/>

&gt; Karen, I had the very same thing happen to the Otter box. I moved <br/>
my because it was quite obvious, It was my first try at a handicapped <br/>
accesible box. I found a similar but less trafficed area. It sounds <br/>
like you did a good job of hiding it, it was a random act I believe <br/>
not like an effort made to seek and destroy.  I say try it , your <br/>
site sounds better. Mine was on the side of a paved walking path in a <br/>
stone cairn.   Good Luck, Leader of the Pack<br/>

Thanks. I think I'll try it where it is now (and hope<br/>
for the best).  It is about 2 or 3 feet away from<br/>
where it was and not quite as obvious.  Since I am not<br/>
too experienced at hiding boxes, I think I was afraid<br/>
that people wouldn't find it, so I may have made it<br/>
too obvious the first time.<br/>
