This series is made up of ten boxes: a normal size box for the first <br/>
and last boxes, and eight microboxes without ink in between.  We ask <br/>
that you please take an ink pad from the first box with you on the <br/>
trail and return it to the first box when you are done.  The last box <br/>
is the only one with a log book, making this count as only one find, <br/>
not ten. <br/>

&gt; and last boxes, and eight microboxes without ink in between.  We <br/>
ask <br/>
&gt; that you please take an ink pad from the first box with you on the <br/>
&gt; trail and return it to the first box when you are done.  The last <br/>
box <br/>
&gt; is the only one with a log book, making this count as only one <br/>
find, <br/>

&gt; From Route 6 in Windham, go past Wal-Mart on the right, past the <br/>
&gt; intersection of Route 203 and eventually you will see a sign for <br/>
&gt; Goodwin State Forest.  Turn left at the sign, then park in the <br/>
&gt; parking lot that will be on your right.  Walk past the information <br/>
&gt; stand and continue on the paved trail past the pavilion.  Start at <br/>
&gt; the metal gate and go around it. <br/>

&gt; little one stops to suck his thumb between two rocks and a large <br/>
&gt; fallen tree bridge on the right side of the trail 27 paces from the <br/>
&gt; gate. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Boom, boom, boom, boom. Take a left onto the white. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The ants go marching two by two hurrah, hurrah.  The ants go <br/>

&gt; chewed tree left of the path.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Turn around and go straight onto the red <br/>

trial.  <br/>
&gt; There will be no blazes and it is a little bit overgrown.  Once you <br/>
&gt; reach a T intersection, take a right.  Shortly after, take a sharp <br/>
&gt; right to stay on red.  March on.  After a few clearings, you will <br/>
