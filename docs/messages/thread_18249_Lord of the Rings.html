                    <div class="plaintext-content">If I remember correctly, Sir Balthazar of San Luis Obispo (Sp?) did<br/>
something along those lines, though I'm not sure if there are still in<br/>
place. I believe they are and you'd have to contact him directly concerning<br/>
them, however, just because a 'series' or 'subject' as been done in one part<br/>
of the country, doesn't mean you can't do it somewhere else.  A Lord of the<br/>
Rings series in each state shouldn't be a problem, since the chances of me,<br/>
for example, getting the stamps in, say, Rhode Island of the LoR stamps,<br/>
when I live in Washington state, are slim to none since I don't travel<br/>
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
But that's only my opinion, I am sure someone else will feel different.  I<br/>
think that every person is an individual (obviously! grin!) and their<br/>
talents are completely different when it comes to carving stamps and how<br/>
they turn out. Lord knows my feeble attempts at stamp carving are mediocre<br/>
at best and that some one could interpret the Curse of the Black Pearl way<br/>
better than me.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents worth.<br/>

I don't want to fill up the talk list with LOTR chatter and get yelled at, just one quick question. I began reading the books in 1972 and have read them at least 10 times. I know the kings of men, dwarf kings, elves (Celeborn and Galadrial) had rings but I don't remember reading that Saruman had one as well. Neither did Elrond I believe. Is that correct or am I really getting as old as my kids say I am?!<br/>

Gandalf. The last bit I got out of "the Unfinished Tales".<br/>

Had to respond to this. Like you, Irene, I have read the books countless<br/>

it out.<br/>

Are you HnH guys planning an LoTR series?<br/>
I mentioned a few weeks ago that I had carved a few stamps for this theme.<br/>
I did Gollum, Minas Tirith, One Ring and my daughter did a basic "LoTR".<br/>
I tried Gandalf but it was terrible.  I also drew a Uruk Hai, but don't like<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
For something different, maybe we could do a joint planting series.<br/>
Your stamps are always much better, but it would be a series to challenge<br/>
some of the CT ones.<br/>
I was sort of thinking about Lake Nockamixon for a site, but I am still<br/>
thinking about petitioning Valley Forge Park for permission.<br/>
But then I started collected images for some nice Valley Forge stamps that<br/>
they would probably approve of more.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if we both wind up doing a set, who cares?  It was a great story and<br/>
a great movie trilogy.<br/>
BTW - my daughter (the LOTR expect with her own website - "The Green<br/>
Dragon") says Elrond definitely had a ring.<br/>
She thinks Saruman had one too, said she saw one in a picture somewhere, but<br/>
I can't find it.<br/>

I don't want to fill up the talk list with LOTR chatter and get yelled at,<br/>
just one quick question. I began reading the books in 1972 and have read<br/>
them at least 10 times. I know the kings of men, dwarf kings, elves<br/>
(Celeborn and Galadrial) had rings but I don't remember reading that Saruman<br/>
had one as well. Neither did Elrond I believe. Is that correct or am I<br/>
really getting as old as my kids say I am?!<br/>

Hi Irene,<br/>
Are you HnH guys planning an LoTR series?<br/>
I mentioned a few weeks ago that I had carved a few stamps for this theme.<br/>
I did Gollum, Minas Tirith, One Ring and my daughter did a basic "LoTR".<br/>
I tried Gandalf but it was terrible.  I also drew a Uruk Hai, but don't like<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
For something different, maybe we could do a joint planting series.<br/>
Your stamps are always much better, but it would be a series to challenge<br/>
some of the CT ones.<br/>
I was sort of thinking about Lake Nockamixon for a site, but I am still<br/>
thinking about petitioning Valley Forge Park for permission.<br/>
But then I started collected images for some nice Valley Forge stamps that<br/>
they would probably approve of more.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if we both wind up doing a set, who cares?  It was a great story and<br/>
a great movie trilogy.<br/>
BTW - my daughter (the LOTR expect with her own website - "The Green<br/>
Dragon") says Elrond definitely had a ring.<br/>
She thinks Saruman had one too, said she saw one in a picture somewhere, but<br/>
I can't find it.<br/>

I don't want to fill up the talk list with LOTR chatter and get yelled at,<br/>
just one quick question. I began reading the books in 1972 and have read<br/>
them at least 10 times. I know the kings of men, dwarf kings, elves<br/>
(Celeborn and Galadrial) had rings but I don't remember reading that Saruman<br/>
had one as well. Neither did Elrond I believe. Is that correct or am I<br/>
really getting as old as my kids say I am?!<br/>

In the Elder Days we used to read the books.  *sigh*<br/>
The ents are still missing their entwives (though the location of them is<br/>
hinted at in the books, for the alert reader).  You could plant the entwives<br/>
and have them get 'found'.  And what ever happened to Saruman's ring?  Is it<br/>
in the Shire?<br/>

  I am working on a series dedicated to the Lord of the Rings.<br/>
  I have already carve the "One Ring", Gollum,  and Minas Tirith.<br/>
  My oldest daughter (the big fan in our family. She saw Return of the King<br/>
5<br/>
  times) did a simple LoTR stamp.<br/>
  I may do one more.<br/>
  These will find a park somewhere in Eastern PA where I can watch over<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
  I think someone else did a series in Western PA, but pulled them recently.<br/>
  I don't care if there is an LOTR stamp in every state.<br/>
<br/>
  Go for it.<br/>

  Has anyone done a Lord of the Rings letterbox?  Perhaps a stamp of a sword<br/>
  or the ring of power?<br/>
