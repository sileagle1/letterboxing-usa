Found 8 and Planted 1<br/>
<br/>
Just a note to let everyone now that I planted my first box today in <br/>
VA and it is on the web. I'm so excited to be on the web and that I <br/>
am finding boxes. The walk in Highland County was a bit wet but I had <br/>
an umbrella and my hubby had on a water proof jacket. I loved the <br/>
signs that he had written to his wife. He was so understanding and <br/>
helped me to find the box in excellent condition. Actually, I found <br/>
two because there was a bonus stamp in the container. I thought that <br/>
somehow it was accidentally left there but my hubby knew about the <br/>
moving boxes. I gues there is still alot I don't know. The moving box <br/>
was placed by the Hitchhiker so it is again on the move. I don't know <br/>
when or where I will replant it but hopefully it won't be too long.  <br/>
I guess one of these days when we go out it won't be raining or wet <br/>
but it is kind of hard to turn around when you are already on the <br/>
road. I guess I'm kind of addicted.  <br/>
