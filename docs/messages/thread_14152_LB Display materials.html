                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is a new folder in the Files section labeled LB Display.<br/>
In that folder are several files that might be helpful for someone <br/>
that wants to put together a small outreach type of display either <br/>
for an organization or as part of an existing trail or nature center.<br/>
<br/>
They are just simple and fun but feel free to use as needed. The <br/>
photos are examples of the display that I put together for an <br/>
environmental fair this March. Please contact me if there are any <br/>
questions about the files or trouble opening them.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Where Were You When I Needed You.  On trails day weekend( June 7-8,2003 ), <br/>
the Long Island Greenbelt Trail Conference sponsored a Hiking Expo.  I finally, <br/>
talked them into a booth on letterboxing,  So, of course , I was responsible <br/>
for  the presentation.  Only knowing about letterboxing from the web site, it <br/>
was a bite of a challenge.  Anyway, I learned a lot by doing.  I have planted <br/>
two letterboxs and found a few when I went to my son's house in Ct. on Easter <br/>
Weekend.  I even found  a letterbox on LI  from the clues. Now,  I just have to <br/>
post the one I planted celebrating the LI Greenbelt's 25th Anniversary and <br/>
the one in NH , Rosemary's Shower.<br/>
<br/>
I will check out  the folder if my computer skills, which are limited will <br/>
let me. <br/>
Thanks for the info. <br/>
