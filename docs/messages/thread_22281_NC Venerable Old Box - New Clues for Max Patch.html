                    <div class="plaintext-content">Max Patch was one of the first boxes in the U.S.  It was seeded and the <br/>
clues written by an orienteer.  Since I was in the area today, I decided to <br/>
check on it, and found a crucial clue no longer available, sight-wise, so I <br/>
wrote new clues just for letterboxers.  Orienteers might still find the old <br/>
ones valid.<br/>
<br/>
The new clues:<br/>
<br/>
OK - letterboxers - new clues!  The "white quartz monolith" is not easily <br/>
seen these days.  And a confession - my husband (who made his living as a <br/>
navigator) and I spent three fruitless hours with a compass trying to find <br/>
this box (our first) using the orienteers' clues....we found it by accident, <br/>
mostly.....so....for the rest of the non-orienteer boxing community:<br/>
<br/>
Park at the Max Patch trailhead.  Be discreet; this is a very popular hiking <br/>
spot.  A leftist attitude helps, along with the lyrics to "99 Bottles of <br/>
Beer on The Wall."  Let the song put rhythm in your step.  When about half <br/>
the beer is gone, you should be near a trickle.  Walk a very short distance <br/>
directly down the trickle - oh, go on and get your feet wet! - to a tree on <br/>
the right with babies shooting up all around her.  Climb up and around and <br/>
under the heavy mossy cradle you'll find a bit of Max Patch history to take <br/>
home with you.<br/>
