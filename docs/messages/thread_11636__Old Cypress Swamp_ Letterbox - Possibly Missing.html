                    <div class="plaintext-content">I searched for yesterday, but could not find.  Located the "Hip" <br/>
sign, bench and cypress log, and saw another rotting log about 10 <br/>
yards behind the bench.  I looked under, around, all over, but no <br/>
box.  You said "Holds our Letterbox", which makes me believe it <br/>
should have been in the log, but could not find any place on that log <br/>
that could hold a box.  There were pieces of the log scattered <br/>
around.  Please let me know if this log was the correct one, and <br/>
about where on the log was the box located (seems like would have <br/>
been at the far end, but that is where all the large pieces were <br/>
spread around).   I went ahead and hid my box farther down the trail, <br/>
so if you go check you can at least get my stamp.  Thanks.<br/>
