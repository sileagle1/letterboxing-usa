This is probably my most 'daring' and 'exciting' box to date!  It's <br/>
actually hidden <i>inside</i> a bookstore, and I never told the <br/>
employees!  Probably isn't ethical, but I figured at the very least <br/>
they'll get more business, sell more books, and heck, it'll <br/>
<i>help</i> them!<br/>
<br/>
It's also the first box of its kind for another reason as far as I <br/>
know involving the use of magnets to keep the box hidden.  =)  I felt <br/>
so darned clever hiding it, I just had to tell everyone about it <br/>
since hardly anybody seems to come out this way for boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all enjoy it!<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely!  I know of other letterboxes hidden in bars and coffee <br/>
shops which are alive and well.  Although in all those cases (at <br/>
least the ones I know about) with letterboxes hidden in public <br/>
buildings, the boxes are behind the counter and you have to go and <br/>
ask one of the employees to pull it out for you, so they obviously <br/>
know of its existence.  In this case, I didn't know anybody at the <br/>
bookstore, so I took the liberty of hiding it without asking for <br/>
permission first.  With your own shop, I'm sure you'll have NO <br/>
trouble getting permission.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
As an added benifit, you'll get to meet all the letterboxers who go <br/>
out to your shop to stamp up!  =)<br/>
