At the intersection of 44 and 169 at Pomfret Center, from the west on 44<br/>
take a left onto 169 North. From the east on 101 take a right onto 169<br/>
North. Go about a quarter of a mile up on 169 and take a right onto Day<br/>
Rd. Go all the way to the end of Day Rd., at the stop sign and take a<br/>
right onto Needles Eye Rd. You will travel .1 of a mile, you will see a<br/>
parking spot on your right near the bulletin board. Pull up and park on<br/>
the grass. From the sign enter the grassy trail and walk along the edge<br/>
of the field.You will swerve to the left and then to the right and you<br/>
will enter a wooden section marked with dark blue blazes. Bare to the<br/>
left and the ravine will be on your right. Keep following the path,<br/>
walking along, notice the steep drop-off with the Day Brook running<br/>
below.Notice up the hill you'll be able to see Day Rd. Continue on and<br/>
soon the trail will bend to the left. You'll come to a giant pine tree<br/>
on the left side of the path. It splits into two sisters. Standing on<br/>
the side of this tree, take a reading of 250 degrees. Off in a distance<br/>
down alittle hill you will see a stump about 3 1/2  feet high set<br/>
between two trees. Between the front tree and the stump, buried under<br/>
rocks and sticks is the Ravine Letterbox. Return to big pine tree,<br/>
continue on the trail and you will soon come to a T. Make a left here<br/>
back to the field. Walk across and up the hill, stay on the path. When<br/>
you get to the top, the trail bends to the left. Just stay on the trail<br/>
and you will walk by a big wooden post, the trail will bend to the left<br/>
in front an old barn. Then it bends back to the right and you will<br/>
follow back to your car.<br/>
