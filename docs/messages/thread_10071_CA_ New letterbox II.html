Napa Valley Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is located in Bale Grist Mill State Park.  Park your <br/>
car and walk the short trail to the Old Bale Mill.  The path splits <br/>
near the mill and you can either walk right to go to the mill or you <br/>
can walk left.  Go left.  You will pass the restrooms and a round <br/>
water-tank looking building.  From the watertank look diagonally <br/>
across the path.  You will see a large rock alongside a small creek <br/>
bed.  Half of this rock is covered with ferns and the other half is <br/>
covered with moss.  Behind and underneath the rock on the mossy side <br/>
is where you will find what you seek.  I have closed off the hole <br/>
with another rock, so you may have to move a rock to find the box.  <br/>
<br/>
After locating the box, head on over to some of the wineries for some <br/>
wine tasting to celebrate.<br/>
