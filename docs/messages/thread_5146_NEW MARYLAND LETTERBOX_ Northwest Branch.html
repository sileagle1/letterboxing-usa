decided to add a few.  Here is the first in a group I will be <br/>
releasing over the next few months... all depending on how long it <br/>
takes me to carve the stamps!<br/>

Good Luck!  I will be placing a few more in the near future.<br/>

<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
This Letterbox is located in quieter section the Northwest Branch <br/>
Park in Silver Spring, MD.  The total hike from where you park is <br/>
about a 5-10 minute walk.  The terrain is a little rocky at places <br/>
but a pair of tennis shoes will more than suffice.<br/>
<br/>
Take Arcola Drive to Kemp Mill Shopping Center, <br/>
Across from Kemp Mill Shopping Center is Lamberton Drive,<br/>
Drive down Lamberton until it dead ends.  <br/>
Two red signs mark the end of Lamberton.  <br/>
On the left side of the street, about 75-100 ft before the dead end, <br/>
there is a trail that leads down to the park.<br/>
<br/>
The Clue:<br/>
<br/>
I found my way to Northwest Branch <br/>
across the bridge I took a walk<br/>
To my left I saw a rocky face, <br/>
And close to the wall I stayed at a moderate pace..<br/>
Kept to the left and passed an almost hidden concrete tower,<br/>
Then passed furry vines and beaver chewed trees.<br/>
<br/>
I looked to my left, and in the distance, up on the hill a bow-legged <br/>
tree--<br/>
Turned the corner and between two "holed" rocks I paused, <br/>
I took twelve steps and there to my left a camouflaged tree.<br/>
(A young Sycamore it might be!)<br/>
<br/>
I looked well beyond itand on the hill--to find a "rock-grown tree,"<br/>
And in the shadows of a tiny cave I hid from thee! <br/>
