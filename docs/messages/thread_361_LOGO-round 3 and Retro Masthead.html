As always, all of your samples are superb.  Thanks for giving me a chance to<br/>
see what my suggestion looks like (#17).  I must agree, it's a bit too much.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to chime in with the rest and say I love #22 as well as the somewhat<br/>
related versions #19 and #18b (although I agree that the t's might look better<br/>
tall like the b).<br/>
<br/>
I would be happy to poll the group for a vote, if anyone thinks it's a good<br/>
idea, but it seems we are coming to a concensus without doing anything of the<br/>
sort.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I've been collecting images for the main page masthead, as well.<br/>
(Linda's retro postcard idea)  Thanks to Thom, Bonnie, and everyone else, for<br/>
the great ideas for pictures to include.<br/>
<br/>
Let me go on record as saying that I absolutely LOVE Duke Ellington, Janis<br/>
Joplin,  Bob Dylan, and ketchup.  My favorite suggestions for this project,<br/>
however, are the outdoor scenes.  I'm thinking about some things like a<br/>
forest, a stream, a painted desert, a white country church, a combine<br/>
harvesting wheat, a barn, some sunflowers, a cactus scene, corn, a waterfall,<br/>
a little red one-room schoolhouse, a cowboy on a horse, a mountain, a log<br/>
cabin, a red dirt road, a cypress swamp, a lake, or a rocky coastline.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying this is a definitive list, or anything.  Just the kinds of<br/>
things I like and have been looking for.  By all means, if some of you have<br/>
other suggestions, speak up.  That's what makes this group so FANTASTIC!!!  I<br/>
also thought wildlife would be appropriate, but couldn't decide what animals<br/>
to include.  Bonnie's suggestions of an eagle and/or bison are great ideas.  I<br/>
had also considered the wild turkey, white-tailed deer, cougar, and wolf.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of wolves, Der Wolf asked for more specifics on the types of pictures<br/>
I'm looking for.  I'm looking for small pictures with good colors and<br/>
contrast... ones that are as identifiable in a small 'thumbnail' as they are<br/>
full size.  I'm also trying to keep in mind that the pictures will be cropped<br/>
in the shape of letters which tend to be vertical... more tall than wide.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to include lots of great colors (in addition to forest green).<br/>
Also, I want fairly generic sorts of pictures.  If I include Niagra Falls, Mt.<br/>
Rushmore, Devil's Tower, or other recognized landmarks, I might give the<br/>
impression that the home states of those national treasures are more special<br/>
than the rest... gotta be fair to everyone.  I don't think any of the pictures<br/>
I used in the unfinished example that I posted will stay.  <br/>
<br/>
I've spent quite a bit of time sorting through pictures... maybe I'm too<br/>
picky.  Some of the water pictures, for example, were tougher than I thought.<br/>
I found lots of pictures that were beautiful full-size, but when I shrunk them<br/>
down, it was hard to tell if you were looking at water, snow, sand, ice, or a<br/>
big white blanket!!  If any of you have some pictures you'd like me to play<br/>
around with, attach them to an email or give me a link to get to them.  Hoping<br/>
to get around to putting the whole thing together within the next week or so.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all your help and support.  Special thanks to Michelle for<br/>
her work with the logo.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mitch, Der Mad Stamper<br/>

<br/>
I love all those images...<br/>
<br/>
Two Points...<br/>
<br/>
1    Why not ring the changes and have different images each month<br/>
say...you could also reflect seasonality then ?<br/>
<br/>
This would save the heart searching a bit....you might even find a space <br/>
for the largest ketchup bottle in the world <big grin=""><br/>
<br/>
2    A bit more techy this...why not java images with sounds too; as you<br/>
mouse over, the images do their things !!!!<br/>
<br/>
A New England Church with bells chiming , Dylan doing a quick ..few<br/>
lines.,  The Horseshoe Falls..er falling !..etc  !..Maybe William<br/>
Clinton's voice on the Mt. Rushmore image....Eagle on the wing ..er what<br/>
do you call the sound .. "screeching" ?  etc etc..Bears make a great<br/>
noise...(heard as I ran away !)...<br/>
<br/>
(I know how little else you must be doing...er like earning a living an<br/>
all ! ) <very big="" grin=""><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Glad to be helpful  <grin><br/>
