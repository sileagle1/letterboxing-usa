                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay..on Monday morning my father and I are leaving on a four day <br/>
trip to Yuma, AZ and back from WA. My mom passed away Wednesday <br/>
morning and we are headed south to scatter ashes. <br/>
<br/>
Dad is intrigued by the Hoover Dam letterbox I was telling him about <br/>
(since I asked if we could stop quick enough to attempt it) and has <br/>
agreed to pick up as many quick driveby boxes as possible. We are <br/>
talking easy ones that are within a mile or so of the route we are <br/>
taking or are at rest areas/truck stops/etc.<br/>
<br/>
Our route will be I-82 from Yakima to I-84 through Oregon, Idaho and <br/>
Utah. Then in Salt Lake we will hit I-15 down to Vegas and will then <br/>
either take State Route 95 or 93 (most likely that road between that <br/>
Lake Havasu and the London Bridge are located on) down to Yuma. We <br/>
will then head back up 95 to I-10 (Blythe, CA) and followe it over to <br/>
I-5 in LA then head home via I-5 to WA. <br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated. We will be hitting the Lighthouse Box <br/>
in Utah (in a shopping center parking lot-Utah?, the Hoover Dam one, <br/>
and the Welcome to Idaho one that is at the Idaho/Oregon Border. I <br/>
think we will try to hit Laughlin/Boulder City but not sure. Any tips <br/>
would help..they don't have to be on the Letterboxing list either. <br/>
<br/>
We are on a short time frame here..we will leave WA on Monday and be <br/>
back by Thursday night. As a side note...I will be able to make it to <br/>
the Memorial Day Weekend Gathering here in WA now!! <br/>
<br/>
I'm also going to be dropping of the Sushi HH letterbox that we <br/>
picked up in DuPont, WA this past weekend.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
A couple of quick and stealthy drive-by boxes less than a mile off I-15 in Las Vegas would <br/>
be the new One-Armed Bandit and Party Hearty!  Also, Crystal Clear and Triangle Building <br/>
are relativelly fast snags.<br/>

interstate - "The Rings" I stopped for it a week or so ago on a <br/>
quick trip to Salt lake City. It's fun because of all the people who <br/>
have stamped into it.  I REALLY enjoyed looking through the sig <br/>
stamps &amp; comments.<br/>

I know of several other drive by boxes along I-15 in Idaho &amp; I-90 in <br/>
Montana but it doesn't appear they'll be on your proposed route.<br/>
