It's on the Woodstock/Putnam Town Line..  Go 171 west.  Go left onto <br/>
Harrisville Rd.  The road is the first left after a big sign that <br/>
says-"Welcome to Woodstock Home of the Woodstock Fair"  At the Y go <br/>
right unto Peake Brook Rd.  The first bridge you go over is were you <br/>
want to park.  (Your best bet is to turn around at the Putnam Water <br/>
Supply Building or Lane Rd then you'll park just before the bridge <br/>
and your on the correct side of the road)  Walk the path towards the <br/>
stream.  Just over a small bump on the path; you'll see 4 black <br/>
chunks of tar.  In between the 4 chunks and the path will be a good <br/>
size rock/boulder.  Under the rock hidden by sticks is the Gone <br/>
Fishing Letterbox.  Please rehide well people fish here, including me.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
