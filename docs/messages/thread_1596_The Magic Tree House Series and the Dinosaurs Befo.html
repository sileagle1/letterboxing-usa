that we would plant some of our own we finally got around to two last <br/>
weekend.  In keeping with the tradition established by some of you we <br/>
came up with an idea for a series of letterboxes.  We decided to name <br/>
ours in honor of Mary Pope Osborne's Magic Tree House books.  It is a <br/>
wonderful series for young school age children in which the two <br/>
characters, Jack and Annie, are magically whisked off to different <br/>
places and times by pointing to books in a magic tree house that <br/>
belongs to Morgan Le Fay.  <br/>
<br/>
We packed up the kids and friends and went to Westwoods to plant our <br/>
first letterbox at what we have always referred to as "Dinosaur <br/>
Rock."  It was only fitting that we went to one of our favorite <br/>
places to plant our first box named after the first book in the <br/>
series, Dinosaurs Before Dark.  In our eagerness to get out the door <br/>
on Saturday we forgot to bring the sheet with info on letterboxing to <br/>
include in the box so if anyone is planning on hiking at Westwoods in <br/>
the near future I would appreciate it if you could bring an extra <br/>
copy of the info sheet to leave in the box.<br/>
<br/>
Since the weather was so good on Sunday we decided to go out again <br/>
and leave a hitchhiker, The Magic Tree House, to help transport other <br/>
letterboxers to magical destinations.  We also have three more <br/>
letterboxes planned for parks and a refuge by where we live that <br/>
don't have boxes yet so there should be more to come in the Magic <br/>
Tree House series shortly<br/>

Dinosaurs Before Dark Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
This can easily be done in conjunction with the other letterboxes at <br/>
Westwoods and is on the path listed back on Jay's route.  After <br/>
stamping in at the Monument Letterbox continue up the orange square <br/>
trail and join the orange circle trail.  Shortly after joining the <br/>
orange circle trail you will go through a rock fissure almost as tall <br/>
as a TRex that will transport you back to the dinosaur age.  Walk <br/>
until you see a dinosaur on your right at 90o.  Go and pet the head <br/>
of the dinosaur.  Turn right, keeping your left hand on the rock and <br/>
take 7 paces.  Reach into the body of the beast and you will find <br/>
what you are seeking.  When you are finished continue on the orange <br/>
circle trail through another fissure, almost man-sized, that you must <br/>
climb out of to return to the present.  Continue on the orange circle <br/>
trail until the white circle intersection and back to your car.<br/>
