has been tore down (the main direction marker in the first clues) <br/>
and the ink pad and stamp had been removed from the box. <br/>
So here are the new clues to the new stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Walk up the street of Love Valley, cowboy town since 1956. Going to <br/>
the wind mill at the end of the street.  There you can look down on <br/>
the arena with it's natural seating.  Go through the walk gate and <br/>
follow the trail down. At the switch back follow that seat section <br/>
across to a popular tree.  Then take 20 steps to a straightup red <br/>
oak (20" through). Then 10 steps to a pile of rocks to the left <br/>
within the small pines, and there is the letterbox.  <br/>
