&gt; I use the The Doubtful Guest image as our "family group" stamp.  I <br/>
&gt; hope I run into her sometime.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What is 100**100?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Scarab of The Doubtful Guests<br/>
<br/>
Dear Scarab (and the rest of the 'boxing world),<br/>
<br/>
100**100 is Fortran's way writing 100 to the 100th power, literally a <br/>
one followed by 200 zeroes. The short-hand name for that is <br/>
a "google."  Add a D at the end of it and you have 100**100D, Googled.<br/>
<br/>
We all got into letterboxing because a storeowner "googled" the name <br/>
of his store. When he did that he found a webpage authored by the <br/>
infamous (but manly) Ryan Carpenter. The pages said something to the <br/>
effect of "I have placed a microbox in ____ store. Don't tell the <br/>
staff, they do not know." The owner thought it was dumb. One of the <br/>
staff thought it was wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Since I happen to think that staff member is wonderful (and the best <br/>
carver we have here) and she is gracious enough to think I am okay <br/>
for a badger, she told me about it. Now I am a teacher; I get paid <br/>
for telling folks stuff. Sure enough, we have now told almost a <br/>
google of folks about boxing. <br/>
<br/>
The core group who keeps in touch regularly calls themselves Googled. <br/>
Our motto is "I feel lucky!" which is also a button on the site <br/>
Google. Members include (listed only by whim, not importance): Ash <br/>
Raven, Pandora, JugglerMouse, Sade from Nebraska, Dave (needs a <br/>
boxing name, I will give him one soon else), Emily the Rose, <br/>
Katherine (likewise about name), Pat and Don M., and your humble <br/>
servant. Now we also have confronted the heartstoppingly beautiful <br/>
Ryan and the sprightly Amanda from Seattle (wait a minute! reverse <br/>
that) and offered them membership in the club. We even offered to <br/>
bring along the goat's blood and Wesson oil for their initiation. <br/>
They seemed a tad reserved but we count them as members, nay, <br/>
spiritual parents. <br/>
<br/>
We have ruled that any box planted by three or more members counts as <br/>
a Googled plant. Hey, with three you get Chaos. And of course, no one <br/>
talks about letterboxing in front of that store owner. Part of the <br/>
rules, don't you know. We started in this around Feb 17, 2003.<br/>

Long answer to a short question,<br/>

   You are not the first to google. Lizardbutt in San Fran. loves the <br/>
word google. He used to add, L a google. L as you know stands for <br/>
Lizards. He dropped his count, so I've picked up the slack. My L's <br/>
stand for anything in the reptile family. I keep track as a tibute to <br/>
