                    <div class="plaintext-content">Others may have different experiences, but my experience with <br/>
Michaels is that all they carry is the starter set which includes a <br/>
carving medium, the #2 and #4 blades and a cheap wooden handle.<br/>
<br/>
Needing, at a minimum, more rubber and the #1 blade, we found them at <br/>
an art supply store not too far from us.  They carried the entire <br/>
line of Speedball blades (#1 through #6), handles, and plenty of <br/>
carving rubber -- from Speedball pink to MasterCarve white (all in <br/>
various sizes).  Rubberstamping may be a craft, but carving is <br/>
considered fine art -- and thus often with the fine art supplies or <br/>
in an art store.  My guess is that many artists carve on these <br/>
mediums as a beginning step to other creations -- perhaps engravings <br/>
or such.<br/>
<br/>
Try stores like the ArtStore or look in your local phone book for a <br/>
commerical art supply store.  These are usually not chains and not <br/>
often well known.  The one we went to was in a warehouse within an <br/>
industrial park and had absolutely everything any artist would need --<br/>
 even rudimentary rubber stamp carvers like us!<br/>

<br/>
The best source for the #1 blade (a necessity!), any other of the 6 <br/>

supply stores are best.  We went to a commercial art supply store <br/>
that was located in a warehouse within an industrial park and found <br/>
everything we needed -- rubber (both kinds produced by Speedball plus <br/>
the entire line of Mastercarve, all the Speedball Lino handles and <br/>
cutters (#1 through #6) and a host of other things such as lighted <br/>
magnifying lamps, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Such stores are not usually chain stores and are not likely to not be <br/>
well known by the general public.  Look in your local yellow pages <br/>
for one or contact the local art society, art program at the high <br/>
school or university near you.<br/>

I was at Michaels (in Federal Way, WA)  yesterday and looked to find the speedball carving tools. Someone had said to look in the calligraphy section. Well, all I found was Speedball pen sets. They are pointy and sharp so I almost thought that was what you all were talking about. I'm glad I didn't get it. I did find a little X-acto pen knife there that I really like. Just have to make sure the baby doesn't get a hold of it and think it's a pen. I am going to look at some art supply stores now. Thanks!<br/>

I agree to look in the fine art section.  The stores I've found it in <br/>
are around art pencils, erasers, etc.  The carving sets were <br/>
initially developed for linoleum carving.  People at the stores don't <br/>

some art supply stores now. Thanks!<br/>

Maybe I'm the only one in the world, but I actually *like* the beginner's <br/>
set!   I bought a bunch of them when I had my Cub Scouts carve stamps, so I wound <br/>
up with extra handles.   I put a different blade in each handle, so when I <br/>
switch blades, i don't have to actually change the blade, I just grab a <br/>
different handle.   They're comfortable in my hand (even more so, for me, than the red <br/>
plastic handle, which I also have).<br/>
<br/>
And yes, they're back with the sketch pads and pencils and stuff.   Makes it <br/>
handy, because I can get carving stuff and logbooks right on the same aisle!<br/>

The store closer to me had the starter set, usually has 1 or 2 sheets of the pink &amp; white stuff on the shelves, and an asortment of blades (but no handles, except for the one in the starter set).  The one further away from me, which I always viewed as the better-stocked store, only had the starter set in stock (and didn't look like there was space on the shelves for anything else that just happened to not be there that day).<br/>

I have always been able to find more than the beginners set at <br/>
Michaels. I got the full carving set with the red handle and several <br/>
blades there. They also sold the beginner set and the pink and white <br/>
stuff in a few different sizes. I didn't get the beginner set b/c <br/>
the tool looked wimpy.<br/>
<br/>
I agree to look in the fine art section. The stores I've found it in <br/>
are around art pencils, erasers, etc. The carving sets were <br/>
initially developed for linoleum carving. People at the stores don't <br/>
always know what that means, but sometimes you get lucky.<br/>

&gt; I was at Michaels (in Federal Way, WA) yesterday and looked to <br/>
find the speedball carving tools. Someone had said to look in the <br/>
calligraphy section. Well, all I found was Speedball pen sets. They <br/>
are pointy and sharp so I almost thought that was what you all were <br/>
talking about. I'm glad I didn't get it. I did find a little X-acto <br/>
pen knife there that I really like. Just have to make sure the baby <br/>
doesn't get a hold of it and think it's a pen. I am going to look at <br/>
some art supply stores now. Thanks!<br/>
