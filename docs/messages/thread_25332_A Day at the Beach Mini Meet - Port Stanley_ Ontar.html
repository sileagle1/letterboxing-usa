Port Stanley, Ontario. The Little Blue Team (our grandsons) have been<br/>
busy carving a series of stamps which they will be planting themselves<br/>
(with supervision of course) and it sounds like the clues will be kind<br/>
of tricky. The boys had a great time at the Box ON event at Rockwood<br/>
last year and want to use some of the ciphers they learned there in<br/>
their clues. Grandpa and I have also been busy. We hope you will enjoy<br/>
the locale and some of the surprises we have in store for you.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt if it will be warm enough to swim, but you just never know, I<br/>
could be wrong. There are tons of amazing things to do in this<br/>
picturesque little village . . . AND we will be planting letterboxes<br/>
near many of these wonderful sites.<br/>
<br/>
The clues to all our boxes will go "live" at midnight on June 16th. To<br/>
pick up a copy of the clues and a goodie bag full of local information<br/>
and maps, meet up with us at our surprise secret location between 8 - 10<br/>
am. Clues to find our secret location will be posted a week before the<br/>
event to give you a chance to figure it out. Don't worry, it will be<br/>
easy and fun. The event stamp will be at this secret location.<br/>
<br/>
We WILL NOT be having a potluck lunch. Bring a picnic basket if you wish<br/>
but we recommend Mackie's on the Beach for fabulous fast food and<br/>
world-famous Orangeade (which is still a family secret to this day) and<br/>
homemade fry sauce . The condiments at Mackie's are so delicious you<br/>
could put them on cardboard and eat them . . . but the hamburgs and hot<br/>
dogs are fabulous too!! The Big Blue Team will be there for lunch at 1<br/>
pm and hope to get a group photo at that time.<br/>
<br/>
We will be doing personal exchanges a little bit differently this year.<br/>
Each participant will be given a little pin to wear on their shirt.<br/>
Watch for these pins as you wander through the village searching for<br/>
letterboxes and swap stamped images as you meet.<br/>
<br/>
If you are planning to stay for the weekend why not purchase tickets to<br/>
the Port Stanley Festival Theatre. And don't forget all the boxes<br/>
planted in London, St. Thomas and Elgin County. If you need help with<br/>
accommodation suggestions please give us a shout.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you at the beach,<br/>
Big Blue Team<br/>
