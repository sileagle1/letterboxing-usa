explanation and request for the future.  One of the big things that <br/>
the moderators on this board have been asked to do is be quick about <br/>
getting rid of spam messages sent to the board, especially ones of a <br/>
lewd nature or that reference adult content.  I understand that such <br/>
things can be offensive to some, funny to others, and annoying to <br/>
many, and we do our best to get rid of them as soon as we see them.  <br/>
However to keep such things off the list we also have to delete any <br/>
replies to the offending post. In the future I would ask that anyone <br/>
that sees such a post because we haven't gotten to it fast enough, <br/>
just ignore the thread please.  I hate to delete posts from <br/>
legitimate letter boxers, and feel guilty doing it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
