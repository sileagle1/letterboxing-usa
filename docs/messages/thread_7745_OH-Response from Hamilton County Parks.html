I wrote to the Hamilton County Park Service and got a really nice <br/>
initial response from a gentleman who works there.  He followed up <br/>
with me today and I think it is a positive sounding letter.  FYI here <br/>
is what he wrote to me, and I told him I would forward it to all of <br/>
you.  <br/>

Hello again Sue:<br/>
Our staff has been working on the area of letterboxing and geocaches <br/>
in the Parks. This activity will not be banned as of now but the Park <br/>
District needs to regulate the activity and is in the midst of <br/>
setting up some policies that address this. A couple areas that will <br/>
be addressed are the sensitive areas in the Parks where rare or <br/>
endangered plants and life are to remain undisturbed and also having <br/>
individuals inform our Safety department of placements of material in <br/>
the Park so that we (trail techs and land management) are aware of <br/>
the material and also don't remove material that has been permitted. <br/>
It seems policies will be in place in the near future. If you are <br/>
setting any materials (boxes etc.) in the Parks, per our Safety <br/>
Manager, please notify our Ranger Dispatchers office at 513.521.3980 <br/>
to inform them. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your inquiry and I will plan on forwarding any <br/>
information or policies along to you if they are ready in the near <br/>
future. <br/>
<br/>

BTW, it feels good to know that the park staff knows your box is out <br/>

At least that is a positive.<br/>

There are a few negatives too.<br/>

2) This activity will not be banned as of now   <br/>

 Okay, THis is how I see the Letter from Hamilton County.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 "REGULATE" I know it said not at this time BUT!!! this statment means they have already talked about Regulating it <br/>
at a Park Board Meeting, If they have not talked about it then this Statment would have not been worded in the way it was.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 "AS OF NOW"  Well, This statment is very clear, Gee, It's September, Less than two months from a Hamilton County Bond Leavy for the parks, Do we Ban it now and deal with the bad press or do we just push it off a few months "FOR NOW" and keep the voters off our backs till after the November Elections have came and gone and we get our money THEN we can Ban the letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I know I sound like oliver Stone here BUT I am only making a point to the letter that was sent to a fellow Letterboxer from the Hamilton County Park Board. I myself; have talked to a<br/>
Ranger and they would like to see them<br/>
gone as they feel that they (they as in Us Letterboxers) are destroying the parks looking for a 10 cent rubber stamp.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Happy Hunting<br/>
<br/>
    FOR NOW (In HAMILTON COUNTY PARKS)<br/>

&gt; Sounds encouraging.  I hope they do not end up quite as restrictive <br/>
&gt; as the Greene Co parks.  <br/>
