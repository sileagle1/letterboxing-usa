have heard of come from burning the stuff on logs while camping.  I <br/>
do find that when dressed for winter, I am less likely to get the oil <br/>
on my skin than during the summer when the stuff is in full leaf.  <br/>
During the winter, I can "usually" walk through the empty vines along <br/>
a river and not get enough oil on my pants and socks to get the <br/>
rash.  The same areas during the summer are no go areas for me and my <br/>
skin.<br/>
<br/>
OK, enough on this rather non letterboxing topic.  I will post no <br/>
more on rhus dermatitis.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to agree with Mary Manatee.  We don't have poison ivy, but we<br/>
certainly have a great abundance of poison oak in Oregon, which, I am<br/>
highly allergic too.  When I get poison oak and it seems to go away, it<br/>
will reappear again for no apparent reason.  It is very frustrating and<br/>
annoying!<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that has ever worked for me is over-the-counter Benedryl<br/>
pills to stop the itching and then a trip or phone call to the doc for a<br/>
prescription topical cream which pretty much goes right to work and gets<br/>
rid of the rash and any trace of it.  I don't know if we have Jewel weed<br/>
in these parts.  I had never heard of it till now.  <br/>

ZANFEL, ZANFEL, ZANFEL...<br/>
<br/>
     I suffer the similar plight of being highly allergic to poison <br/>
oak, ivy &amp; sumac--most cases require prescriptions of prednisone to <br/>
bid it farewell!  I recently heard about a product called Zanfel <br/>
that is supposed to work immediately on cases of poison oak, ivy &amp; <br/>
sumac (even on the rash regardless of what stage of 'ooze' it is in--<br/>
pardon me for the gory details but that's usually the normal chain <br/>
of events for any &amp; all cases I get of this stuff).  <br/>
     My sister (non-letterboxing one) in Northern California who is <br/>
similarly 'nuclear' reactive to this stuff heard about it recently <br/>
from, of all places, Paul Harvey, and immediately made it her <br/>
mission in life to find it &amp; try it.  Soon thereafter, she came home <br/>
with another case of poison oak and now she swears by Zanfel!!!  I <br/>
think she said she found it at Rite Aid but it should also be <br/>
available at those other drugstore chains, too.  I think, however, <br/>
it may run quite expensive, though.  But personally speaking, I'm <br/>
willing to spend $60 a tube for anything that will rid me of that <br/>
torture!!!  And that says a lot coming from an EXTREMELY frugal <br/>
person....<br/>
<br/>
Hope this renders some comfort to other letterboxers out there...<br/>

First official trip of the summer to go letterboxing in glorious New  <br/>
England.<br/>
<br/>
Found the first box.<br/>
<br/>
Had a bit of trouble finding the second box. But did find a little  <br/>
toad who hopped off the path. My 6 year old said, "hey a toad. I  <br/>
think it went in here in the plants."<br/>
<br/>
OH MMMAN!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
So I said, "Just slowly step away from the three-leaved plant  <br/>
climbing the tree. I will Technu you when we get to the car just  <br/>
don't . . . scratch your face. . ."<br/>
<br/>
OH MMMMMAN!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
"Don't touch anywhere else, just put your hands to your . . . STOP  <br/>
SCRATCHING YOUR FACE!!! No, I don't want to hold your hand at this  <br/>
moment. Ahhh, get away from me!!!! RUN AWAY!!!!!"<br/>
<br/>
First day out. Poison ivy. On the face and neck, of course it doesn't  <br/>
appear for a day after the event. He wakes up in the morning and his  <br/>
eye is all puffy and little red blisters start appearing on his  <br/>
cheeks. My brother says my wife is going to fire me from the Stay-at- <br/>
home-dad thing. He suggests I should look into severance pay.<br/>

Do you suppose we could attribute the same "Carbon Dioxide" problem to<br/>
the spread and increased population of Ticks??? LOL<br/>
<br/>
Man, was in kennenbunkport after searching for a box, My wife, my<br/>
daughter and I stripped down to our skivies wilst picking off all of<br/>
those little buggers, ewww!!  Collectively we removed close to 40<br/>
between the 3 of us, AHHHHHHH!!!! &lt;&lt;<quivering impending="" of="" tick<br="">
nightmares&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    LOL<br/>
<br/>
Any insight as to why there are so many of them? Winters not cold<br/>
enough? Global Warming? Population Control? &lt;-- Opps how did that one<br/>
get in there??<br/>

all over my face (yes, one eye ended up being swollen shut from it), neck, chest <br/>
 and arms.  Luckily me two little ones did not get it.  I saved for one  year <br/>
to have a special 5 year anniversary dinner at the Four Seasons in Boston  <br/>
with my husband and boy did I look like something from the black lagoon!<br/>
<br/>
At dinner, my husband says, "So will this (the poison ivy episode) slow  down <br/>
your letterboxing plans this summer?"  My answer..."No way!"<br/>
<br/>
My doctor put me on steriods for 21 days and not that I would suggest such  a <br/>
strong tactic to rid yourself of poison ivy, if you have it near your eyes ,  <br/>
it is the way to go.<br/>

Happy Summer and box hunting.....GlobeBear<br/>

  Oh yeh.<br/>
<br/>
  First official trip of the summer to go letterboxing in glorious New <br/>
  England.<br/>
<br/>
  Found the first box.<br/>
<br/>
  Had a bit of trouble finding the second box. But did find a little <br/>
  toad who hopped off the path. My 6 year old said, "hey a toad. I <br/>
  think it went in here in the plants."<br/>
<br/>
  OH MMMAN!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
  So I said, "Just slowly step away from the three-leaved plant <br/>
  climbing the tree. I will Technu you when we get to the car just <br/>
  don't . . . scratch your face. . ."<br/>
<br/>
  OH MMMMMAN!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
  "Don't touch anywhere else, just put your hands to your . . . STOP <br/>
  SCRATCHING YOUR FACE!!! No, I don't want to hold your hand at this <br/>
  moment. Ahhh, get away from me!!!! RUN AWAY!!!!!"<br/>
<br/>
  First day out. Poison ivy. On the face and neck, of course it doesn't <br/>
  appear for a day after the event. He wakes up in the morning and his <br/>
  eye is all puffy and little red blisters start appearing on his <br/>
  cheeks. My brother says my wife is going to fire me from the Stay-at- <br/>
  home-dad thing. He suggests I should look into severance pay.<br/>
