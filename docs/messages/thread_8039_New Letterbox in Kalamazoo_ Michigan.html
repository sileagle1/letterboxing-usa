Easy walking<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The "First in the `Zoo" letterbox is located in Kleinstuck Preserve, <br/>
a 50 acre oasis in the heart of Kalamazoo, Michigan.<br/>
Most city maps will show it although it may not be specifically <br/>
named. Check out the website: http://www.wmich.edu/environmental-<br/>
studies/drew/kleinst.htm<br/>
There are several entrances to the preserve, but to find the "First <br/>
in the `Zoo" letterbox use the following:  <br/>
<br/>
Enter behind the YMCA on Stearns &amp; Maple Street off Oakland Drive. <br/>
The south (far) end of the parking lot leads you to the outdoor <br/>
tennis courts and the boardwalk. Follow the boardwalk to the path <br/>
that leads into Kleinstuck.<br/>
Very soon you'll see a manhole cover  you're on the right path.<br/>
Follow the path to the right; you'll see a welcome sign.<br/>
When you come upon a short steel stump, go right up the hill.<br/>
A lonely, beheaded pine greets you here.<br/>
Look 320 degrees for a trail and follow it.<br/>
Then turn left and go.<br/>
A short diversion to the right reveals a small cement retaining wall <br/>
and a path to the marsh.<br/>
Walk to the clearing look and listen. Could be dogs, could be frogs. <br/>
Could be quiet.<br/>
This marsh is the center of the 50 acre haven of forest and meadow <br/>
located in the city of Kalamazoo.<br/>
Return to the main trail  it circles the marsh to the right.<br/>
Follow this trail past a green bark tree on your right a red top on <br/>
your left. and onward.<br/>
Continue past the wide gravel path and keep to the right.<br/>
This next part is the longest segment of the trail. Be patient. <br/>
You're about half way. You're circling the marsh on a clockwise path.<br/>
Finally you'll begin an easterly swing and you'll meet the *champion <br/>
on the right side of the trail.<br/>
125 steps (plus or minus) past the champ, you'll find a place to rest <br/>
on your right.<br/>
You can take a break and enjoy another view of the marsh.<br/>
Back on the main trail, you'll begin to turn to the SE<br/>
Look for a little spur to the left and go. <br/>
(If you see a long, rather straight eastbound stretch of the main <br/>
circle trail, you've gone too far.)<br/>
18 steps and you're face-to-face with a large tree at the small path.<br/>
Look westerly at 280 degrees. At 17 steps into the woods is a double-<br/>
trunk tree with a branch leaning between the uprights.<br/>
At the base of this tree is the "First in the `Zoo".<br/>
To return, either re-trace your steps in reverse<br/>
OR<br/>
Continue on the main circle trail until you find the cement retaining <br/>
wall and your first view of the marsh.<br/>
Then turn around and take 20 steps back on the main trail to the <br/>
first path to your right.<br/>
You're on your way out. <br/>
(Thanks to WMU Environmental Studies website for the lovely <br/>
descriptions of the marsh area. *The champion is described at the <br/>
website.)<br/>
