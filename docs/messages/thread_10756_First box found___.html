&gt; Subject: Re: First Box Found!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ahh,  the captivating power that finding a 'first' box has.  We are <br/>
&gt; like fish that swallow the bait - hook, line and sinker!  Initially <br/>
&gt; we are caught unawares, casually musing about when and where we might <br/>
&gt; go to look for our first letterbox.  Even after the first bite, we <br/>
&gt; think we are free to come and go as we please.  But beware! Before <br/>
&gt; long, each unplanned weekend, day or even hour becomes prey to plans <br/>
&gt; for letterboxing hikes.  An excursion to visit Mom or Dad becomes <br/>
&gt; another quest and looses it's original purpose (If I just make this <br/>
&gt; one little detour, I'll still have 1/2 an hour left to visit my <br/>
&gt; folks). Finally, on one fine day while driving to work, we suddenly <br/>
&gt; find ourselves in a beautiful but remote wooded area, eternally <br/>
&gt; trapped in the clutches of letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; Enjoy your captivity!<br/>
