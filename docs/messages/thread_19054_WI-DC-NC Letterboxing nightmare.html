<br/>
Last night I dreamt that two large groups of people, children as well as <br/>
adults, were letterboxing in a locale that was downtown Milwaukee, the <br/>
Smithsonian grounds, and the Biltmore Estate all rolled into one.  Many of <br/>
the letterboxes were hidden in fake rocks.<br/>
<br/>
Everytime they found a box, they taped a note to the top of it that read 'WE <br/>
FOUND THE LETTERBOX!"  After I discovered the first note, I tried to remove <br/>
all the notes and find the boxers to tell them they were missing the point <br/>
entirely.  They also were leaving boxes, but each box was identical - a <br/>
bright white round hollow plastic rock embossed on top with a crescent moon <br/>
and stars.<br/>

I had one last week, it went like this. <br/>
After a grueling 2 hour hike, uphill, in the snow I finally found <br/>
the target letterbox. It had a frozen peanut butter and jelly <br/>
sandwich in it. After such a long hike, I was hungry but, did not <br/>
have any milk. It was horrifying.<br/>

Then I woke up, and went downstairs to make a real one. All's well <br/>
that ends well!!<br/>

rain although we're drying off nicely now.  (Hate to imagine what it <br/>
would look like if all the rain we've had WAS snow! Ugh!)<br/>
<br/>
Why not visit WI soon (maybe come to the Great Lakes Gathering next <br/>
Sat) and see for yourself? :-)  Just stay out of the lake until <br/>
further notice... ;-)<br/>
