Then it's into Massachusetts for 90 miles or so.  A bit longer than Connecticut, but still, I should be through that state in less than a week too!<br/>

A gather on Mt. Greylock would be a good choice. There<br/>
are several brand new boxes on that mountain, and it's<br/>
relatively easy to get to.<br/>

do you think you'll be able to attend the Wendell, Ma gathering?<br/>
It is for the weekend of August 16. It may be well worth your<br/>
while to hang out for this event!<br/>
Just a thought, otherwise we would love to meet up with you at<br/>
some point while you are in the NorthEast!<br/>

It seems Internet access is getting harder to acquire, so I fear I will not have a chance to post more of my trail adventures until after I actually finish--perhaps in late September.  I'll try to get in one more before I finish the trail, but no promises.<br/>
<br/>
For you letterboxers out there, the White Mountains are simply incredible!  Get out there before the snows start!  =)  Not recommended for children and people with weak hearts, however.  Those trails kicked my butt!  Haven't they ever heard of SWITCHBACKS in this part of the country?!<br/>
