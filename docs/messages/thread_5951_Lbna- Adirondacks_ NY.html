<br/>
Located near Pine Lake, in the town of Caroga Lake, NY.<br/>
Hidden on July 1st by Grandma, Grandpa, Dad, and kids.<br/>
Medium difficulty clues, a compass is recommended, 30 minute hike, <br/>
   bring swim suit.<br/>
<br/>
*Begin by finding the Nine Corner Lake Trail, located off 29A<br/>
*Head North .9 miles<br/>
*Just before the lake take the right fork in the trail, 330' NNW<br/>
*With the lake on your left, follow the right fork trail again across the <br/>
stone damn<br/>
*At the end of the damn, head 335' NNW towards the large tree stump,<br/>
          keeping the large boulders on your right<br/>
*At the back of the boulder cluster, head 30' NNE 56 steps, and<br/>
          pass between the large boulder on the right and 2 smaller ones on <br/>
your left<br/>
* Find the box in the crevice on the Northeastern side of the 2nd smaller <br/>
boulder<br/>
<br/>
There is a large rock just off shore which has been a delight to jump (dive) <br/>
off of for generations. Enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
This box has been named in honor of our dog Peanut, who suffered a bad cut on <br/>
one of her pads while on this hike. Beware of campfire sites in this area, <br/>
they are known for the glass and remember to put your dogs back on a leash <br/>
until safely past the glass.<br/>
