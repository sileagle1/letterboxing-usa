We are getting ready to go camping in Jim Thorpe next weekend and <br/>
was wondering if there are any boxes in that area??  We will be <br/>
heading from NJ on either Route 78 or Route 80. I sort of remember <br/>
someone posting suggestions to boxes around the Delaware Water Gap?? <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
There's not a lot in the immediate vicinity of Jim Thorpe (just 2 in Carbon <br/>
County), but within a one hour radius you'll find the boxes in Northampton, <br/>
Monroe, Lehigh and Schuylkill counties. Check the clues carefully -- a <br/>
number of the Northampton County boxes are MIA.<br/>
<br/>
For some reason, the Mt. Minsi box (Monroe Cty) isn't listed on the Eastern <br/>
PA page, but it's still active (I was just there a couple of weeks ago), <br/>
though it is a bit of a hike:<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/Canopy/7962/minsi.htm<br/>
This is right at Delaware Water Gap at I-80.<br/>
<br/>
On the other side of the Delaware River in Northern NJ, there are 2 more <br/>
letterboxes in Warren County (DWG &amp; Mt Tammany).<br/>
<br/>
There are also a number of boxes in NJ that are pretty convenient to I-80 <br/>
and I-78. Holler if you want some suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you're up for a mystery, my new Bull Hill box is north of <br/>
Scranton, and I've got a couple more planted in Scranton for which I'm <br/>
finishing up the clues:<br/>
