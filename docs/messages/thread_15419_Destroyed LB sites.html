We thought the shoe tree was one of the coolest letterbox sites we had seen. There is another tree on the Mtn road from Agnes to Grants Pass. At least it was there 3 yrs ago and was crying out for a letterbox. Our only destroyed sites came at the hands of a jerk that thought it was alright to convert our letterbox series to his geocache series. We have had some construction in the area of another letterbox that has made the box nearly wheel chair accessible so that's a plus in my book. Don<br/>
