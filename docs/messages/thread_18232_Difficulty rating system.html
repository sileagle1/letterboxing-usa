    Well I rarely ever post, but felt I needed to this<br/>
time! :-) Steve this is the coolest system!!! Thanks<br/>
so much! After you sent this post I went to the link<br/>
and decoded the box from y-nought! How neat how it<br/>
gives you the description so you do not have to look<br/>
up what each letter means!!!!! :-) Thanks so much for<br/>
all your hard work to make things easier for the<br/>
people who would like to use it!! :-)<br/>

As for the other hurtfull few, there are people who realize their own<br/>

I am silent on this list, just letting things go by and reading that which<br/>
is of interest to me...  However, this post torqued my trigger on one simple<br/>
aspect....  Childishness...<br/>
<br/>
This has been asked time and time again to many people that have attempted<br/>
to make the letterboxing world a little bit easier for everyone involved...<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
What does it matter if someone creates "yet another" mailing list?  What<br/>
does it matter if someone creates a discussion forum?  Why do some people<br/>
feel the need to stoop so low as to hide behind a mask because they can't<br/>
come out and be an adult with their feelings about these things??  No one is<br/>
forcing you to use "yet another" mailing list, or "yet another" discussion<br/>
forum... If you don't like the idea, then don't entertain it!!!  But please,<br/>
have some consideration for everyone else on these lists and keep the flame<br/>
wars non-existent...  This is a family hobby, meant for everyone to enjoy...<br/>
why try and drive them away with your pettiness and childish behavior?<br/>
<br/>
And with that, I shall return to my silent existence on this list yet once<br/>
more, wishing everyone well!!<br/>

Call me a softy, but I'd like to give the person a benifit of a <br/>
doubt.  The post about needing a decoder to understand an 'easy' <br/>
system makes a good point, I think.  Something that's easy should be <br/>
intuitive and not need a decoder.<br/>
<br/>
Why use an obvious fake name?  Maybe they like Steve and was afraid <br/>
a little constructive critisism would harm the friendship?  Okay, <br/>
far fetched, I grant you, but we don't know the reason for them <br/>
wanting to hide their identity.  Some people are shy about entering <br/>
anything that might be considered controversial.  Maybe there's a <br/>
conflict of interest involved.  Who knows?<br/>
<br/>
But tearing down others hoping to make themsevles look bigger?  <br/>
Really, how does someone look 'bigger' if they're hiding behind a <br/>
fake name?  Most likely, they just don't like Steve on a personal <br/>
level and has nothing to do with making themselves look better.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, while the tone of the message was probably harsh, I'll <br/>
go on record as agreeing with the content.  I mean, really, people.  <br/>
This difficulty rating system is as easy to use as a VCR remote <br/>
control.  It's so easy, Steve had to make a 'user manual' for it!<br/>
<br/>
That's not an 'easy' system, it's a complete failure on a user <br/>
interface level.  I don't even know where to begin to suggest an <br/>
improvement except to throw the whole thing out.<br/>
<br/>
Now if Steve is trying to make something fun, different, or <br/>
possibily entertaining (depending on how much you like puzzle <br/>
solving), the difficulty rating system is a roaring success.  But on <br/>
a user interface level, it's bloody awful.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not trying to tear anyone down, that's just my opinion.  But <br/>
Steve's a big boy and can handle a little constructive critisism.  <br/>
But you know, in the society we live, constructive critisism tends <br/>
to make people look bad.  It doesn't matter if it's genuine or <br/>
correct, but critisism has a very negative connotation in this <br/>
society and I understand perfectly well why someone would want to <br/>
provide it under a false name.<br/>
<br/>
When people know a given thought can't be pointed back to them, they <br/>
can be much more truthful than they otherwise would be.  Why do you <br/>
think so many surveys in this country are done anonymously?  As soon <br/>
as they are no longer anonymous, the results aren't as good.  People <br/>
write what they think will make themselves look better, not <br/>
necessarily the god's honest truth.<br/>

Have you tried Steve's system, including the decoder?  All you do is<br/>
pop in the code that the box creator used, click on the button and<br/>
poof!  The answer's there, so easy.  Anyone who knows how to cut and<br/>
paste can use the decoder.  <br/>
<br/>
No one needs to use it if they don't want to.  If they don't like it<br/>
then skip right on by and go straight to the clues for the letterbox.<br/>
 Don't like the letterbox?  OK, then leave it, it's just a plastic box<br/>

People go thru-hiking on the 2,173-mile Appalachian Trail with their <br/>
cat.  I've never heard of anyone letterbox with a cat, but I <br/>
wouldn't be surprised.  ;o)<br/>

But some have said that I am sick and twisted. So maybe that doesn't <br/>
count for much.<br/>

Despite the moaning and groaning and complaining I think your <br/>
comments, suggestions and ideas are usually right on target and <br/>
benifical Ryan ... <br/>

So I would encourage you to keep them coming, so long as they don't <br/>
get personal.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It has been sometime since I have been active on the list, with the <br/>
recent activity in my everyday life; letterboxing was just put on <br/>
hold for a bit.  But I have tried to follow the list and help the <br/>
moderators out as much as possible.  Seems now things have mellowed <br/>
out and I will be able to focus more now.<br/>
<br/>
Considering the fact that I have received so many emails about this <br/>
recent thread, as have other moderators, I thought I would give my <br/>
public opinion on it.<br/>
<br/>
Kris said:<br/>
"But please, have some consideration for everyone else on these <br/>
lists and keep the flame wars non-existent... This is a family <br/>
hobby, meant for everyone to enjoy...why try and drive them away <br/>
with your pettiness and childish behavior?"<br/>
<br/>
I did not see the original post from "raven hoose" to be a flame <br/>
war; I saw it as a comment just like any other comment, and the only <br/>
thing I see here as a blatant flame is the responses to the post <br/>
where the poster is called childish and numerous other things.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we should all remember that those that live in glass houses <br/>
should not throw stones? <br/>
<br/>
As for those that have written asking that I take some action about <br/>
the recent tit for tat on this thread, I can only say that there is <br/>
really not much the moderators can do about this, but I do know that <br/>
the parties have been asked to take the thread private at this <br/>
point.  In the future I would urge those that find such a thread <br/>
annoying or distasteful might want to skip over posts from those <br/>
that are repeatedly posting in the thread and save yourselves some <br/>
time and aggravation.<br/>
