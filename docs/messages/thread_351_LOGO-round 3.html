ideas some of you posted or sent. If I have <br/>
forgotten any, let me know. <br/>
<br/>
I'd like to throw my opinion into the process,<br/>
hoping to steer people towards concurrence rather<br/>
than a "fanning out" of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
It's my opinion that we should avoid any literal<br/>
representation in the logo. Symbolism<br/>
 can still <br/>
be apparent and even strong, but there's not really a <br/>
need to have the logo say "this is what this is".<br/>
<br/>
I'm back to the opinion that a logo should be just <br/>
a symbol, and not<br/>
 a representational illustration <br/>
of "things". <br/>
<br/>
With letterboxing in particular,<br/>
 several overlapping<br/>
elements of the activity combine to make the whole, <br/>
but once<br/>
 a single element is represented *realistically*<br/>
in a logo, then other elements must <br/>
either be added (cluttered)<br/>
or take a back seat. I don't think it's really necessary to tell<br/>
the whole story of letterboxing in one little picture. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, thanks for all the feedback on the sketches.<br/>
Keep 'em coming. Look at some logos of other <br/>
companies to see what kind of stuff you like.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi again Michele<br/>
<br/>
I dont really think Brits should vote..but well, I will anyway....<grin><br/>
<br/>
Here's a view from across the pond....<br/>
<br/>
First and very much Foremost...........You really have done an excellent<br/>
job in putting up these images..I had thought ( worried) that you were<br/>
making a rod to beat yourself..but the thoughts seem to be converging so<br/>
maybe you wont be drawing suggestion page ..37  <big grin=""> <br/>
<br/>
So my views for the melting pot with explanations...<br/>
<br/>
Identity Monograph<br/>
+++++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
I always liked the clean brisk image of 5b and enjoyed its graduated<br/>
colours...to me it was grass and sky..the A or Arrow..is a matter of no<br/>
big difference...I can see this on small patches (rectangular) ..on folks<br/>
clothes..on packs..or as a metal enamelled badge (is that "pin" in<br/>
US-speak) or on the foot of web / written stuff ..or top right / left<br/>
..........and of course on stamps....etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
I feel it is very crisp ..punctuated ..seems not too corporate..but<br/>
playful..Waves are soft..a little mysterious..like the sea and yet (as you<br/>
say,) reminicent of a flag ..and the US flag in particular..and  of course<br/>
it's the metaphor of a postal service...which in some ways is off<br/>
track..heretic though I may be...<br/>
<br/>
I wondered if it would still seem graduated in monochrome or engraved on<br/>
objects..or say in 5% or 10% as a watermark etc..but it still looks good<br/>
to me..<br/>
<br/>
The red ( white implied) and blue is *very* Americana to me ..a little<br/>
retro 50's ish ..like Coke Commercials of the times...That's maybe how it<br/>
should be (it is not Canada or Istanbul though)....once again it's message<br/>
is lost in monochrome though..<br/>
<br/>
My vote is 18b For A Continental USA feel   ( or 5b..in green to blue..a<br/>
close second..for a more neutral feel ) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Long  Masthead<br/>
+++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
Whilst I dislike a multiple logo concepts in principle, I can see that a<br/>
house style might include something for letterhead / web heads etc which<br/>
needs the "monograph" decoded into words...<br/>
<br/>
I see the Letteboxing USA number 21 as my favourite for that from those<br/>
shown....<br/>
<br/>
Though it jangles at my sensibilities that the top of the T's have been<br/>
truncated into the Pi sign...<br/>
<br/>
This needs to be able to be moulded to various uses..it seems to me it<br/>
needs to be able to wind itself around circular objects too.......and be<br/>
in log books in the boxes....seems fine for that<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other Thoughts<br/>
++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
The font style for the mast, needs to be able to be accesible for other<br/>
phrases..eg L-USA Millenium Walk...<br/>
<br/>
oh dear did another idea fall in there <chuckle><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once again long and winding words....sorry for my verbosity...<br/>
<br/>
To those who read this ..my sincerest gratitude....and applaud....<br/>

I'm going to keep it simple. <br/>
<br/>
#22 RULES!  <br/>
<br/>
18b is a good challenger (although I agree w/ The Moorland Wiz; since the b reaches out on top, couldn't the t's do the same?)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for the good work, Michelle.<br/>

yup...  I'm in agreement... #22... it has all the elements without using<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are certainly a lot of votes coming in for #22, so I am a <br/>
little reluctant to cast contrary votes at this time. But as much as <br/>
I like various aspects of all the logos Michelle has put up, I still <br/>
don't feel that we've hit the right one yet.<br/>
<br/>
The problem I have is with the letter LUSA: the L just doesn't seem <br/>
substantial enough to stand for Letterboxing, and the resulting <br/>
acronym isn't really pleasing to the ear or the mind (Just my <br/>
opinion). Erik and others I think have also pointed out problems they <br/>
see with the acronym.<br/>
<br/>
The logos of Michelle's that seem to get around this objection the <br/>
best are 6 and 16. I'm wondering if it would be possible to work a <br/>
little more on a compact letterboxing icon that could take the place <br/>
of the L in some of the other designs. The postmark symbol inside a <br/>
box? Or the round postmark symbol somehow looking a bit like a <br/>
compass rose? Something that suggests the buried/underground nature <br/>
of the box? <br/>
<br/>
I think you make a good point, Michelle, when you say that the logo <br/>
doesn't have to symbolize or include all the aspects of letterboxing <br/>
- to define it completely. This could indeed make the symbol to <br/>
cluttered. But I don't think we've gone far enough yet in suggesting <br/>
or symbolizing any of the essential aspects of the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
I am probably just reflecting my own inclinations towards <br/>
symbolism/coding/decoding etc and my weaknesses as a <br/>
graphical/artistic person.<br/>
<br/>
I think all the contributions and discussion on this issue are great. <br/>
This is quite a group!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A quick review of what ideas &amp; symbolism we would like to include in our<br/>
logo for L-USA (please feel free to contribute)...<br/>
<br/>
1. The name or acronym<br/>
<br/>
2.  something having to do with compasses, orienteering, direction<br/>
<br/>
3.  The "postal" or letter aspect of letterboxing<br/>
<br/>
4.  The hand-made and unique nature of every box and clue<br/>
<br/>
Again, placing my vote for #22.  It is not the logo I would have<br/>
designed.... since I am a different artist &amp; have a different image in<br/>
my head.  But the design is sound... extremely well executed and<br/>
represents all of what I consider to be important for this logo.  When I<br/>
consider attempting to design the logo I would like, it doesn't improve<br/>
on Michelle's design in any way.<br/>
<br/>
Well done Michelle!!<br/>

I vote for #22.  I like the rubber stamp look.<br/>
<br/>
But I still like the postcard idea and vote for that one too.<br/>
<br/>
If I had to pick, I would choose postcard first and rubber stamp 2nd.<br/>
<br/>
Linda&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What about a postcard with a small rubber stamp logo ON it??  The best of both<br/>
worlds.  I like that #22 also, - like the hand-carved look. <br/>
<br/>
Hoggie  (who said she would not VOTE, but hey..... OPINIONS, now that's a<br/>
different story!, LOL)<br/>
