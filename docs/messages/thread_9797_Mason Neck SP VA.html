It is SOO beautiful there.  I was amazed that I was only the third person to stamp into the boxes.   The views are amazing.<br/>

And, the biggest thrill of my day was that I saw a Bald Eagle.  It was spectacular.<br/>

And yes, we found ALL of Scooby!  We had a great day.  The first box was much easier to find with the new clues.  I think I got confused the first time because it said the Spooky Grey tree was on the right, it's actually on the left.  Scott LOVED the series.  And now I've officially gone letterboxing in the snow!  The snow started falling as we went looking for the ADG's 2 boxes at Fountainhead.<br/>

<p>I too missed Nesting Eagles.  I still have to go back there to get nesting eagles :^)  we were scampering threw the woods with flash lights trying to find the last one of the before the gate closed.  Although we found them about 2 months ago.  Great Park.<br/><br/></p></div>
