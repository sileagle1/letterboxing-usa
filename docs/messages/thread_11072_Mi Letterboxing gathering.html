I understand that Waterloo rec area in Chelsea and Hudson Mills <br/>
Metropark are both being considered? I vote for Hudson Mills, it <br/>
about 10 minutes away from my house! The park is a nice one, lots of <br/>
trails, picnic area, etc. I'm not sure about indoor area for meeting <br/>
places, etc. I don't know much about the Waterloo rec area. If <br/>
Springchick or whoever wants to email me to let me know what the <br/>
specific needs for the gathering would be, I can work on finding <br/>
out. It would also be helpful to know how many plan to attend.<br/>

Waterloo later this week.  I have been to Hudson Mills.  I think that <br/>
the trail availability at both places meets our needs, but right now <br/>
I am favoring Waterlook Rec Area because there is camping available <br/>
on site, which is a big factor for those of us who don't live 10 <br/>
minutes away.<br/>
<br/>
Another factor is a covered shelter...  it doesn't necessarily need <br/>
to be an indoor shelter, but covered would be a good idea.  With <br/>
people coming from significant distances, I would hate to get rained <br/>
out, especially considering there will be a couple of different <br/>
workshops going on and the potluck.<br/>
<br/>
It appears that there will be about 15-18 people, that I am aware <br/>
of...  there could be others that just haven't made any contact, <br/>
which is fine also.<br/>
<br/>
I will post to the list after my trip down there.<br/>

I know Hudson Mills has outdoor covered areas, I'm not sure about <br/>
indoor areas, except for a small area in the building that houses <br/>
some administrative offices.  <br/>
Let me know if I can help you in any way..there are a couple of us <br/>
local letterboxers that may be atending.<br/>
