Good eye!!  Multnomah Falls is a very memorable sight.  They say it's the most<br/>
photographed feature in Oregon.  If you think it's beautiful in photos and on<br/>
a rubber stamp, you should come see it in person some time.  It's not wide and<br/>
magnificent like Niagra, but has a majesty that is uniquely beautiful.  That<br/>
slender thread of water plummeting from nearly 2000 feet above your head to<br/>
disappear into a veil of mist is something to behold.  It's so tall, I can't<br/>
ever seem to get it all into my camera frame.  And the water keeps flowing<br/>
year 'round.  In the winter, it forms long, magnificent icicles that are<br/>
fantastic!!!  And don't forget, there are a number of other GORGEous falls<br/>
just a short distance away... and now most of them have letterboxes nearby<br/>
just waiting for you to discover!!!  The weather is always relatively mild<br/>
here, and the hiking trails are open all year.  Ready for a vacation??<br/>

&gt; Hey Mitch, want to hear a story?<br/>
&gt;  I was over at a friend's house, and there was this picture there that<br/>
looked<br/>
&gt;  familiar to me.  Suddenly I said "That's COLUMBIA RIVER GORGE!!!"  See, I<br/>
&gt;  recognised that beautiful picture from your stamp, even though the site was<br/>
&gt;  halfway across the continent.  She was so impressed, it was funny.<br/>

<br/>
Soon to be shivering in<br/>
