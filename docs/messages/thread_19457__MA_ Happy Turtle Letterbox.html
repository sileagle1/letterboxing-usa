                    <div class="plaintext-content">Happy Turtle Letterbox in Wrentham, MA was listed as possibly missing <br/>
on the LBNA website after an email from someone saying it wasn't <br/>
there.  I checked it yesterday and it was there!!!!!!!!  So, go find <br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
No one had found it since I updated the clues to say it was reported <br/>
missing...learned my lesson!  Check the location myself before I <br/>
report that it is missing!<br/>
