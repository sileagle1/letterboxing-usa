child or missing hiker.  Once a month, they have a practice weekend in<br/>
the park to sharpen their skills or train new dogs.  I've been a<br/>
'victim' for them now and again, hiding in the woods for the dogs to<br/>
find me.  On their last practice weekend, they were deep in the woods<br/>
when Sampress signaled that he had found human scent.<br/>
<br/>
Sampress is named after the golf pro because his handler is a golf<br/>
nut.  They knew it wasn't a corpse, because he would have given them a<br/>
different signal, the one they refer to as "The Fifth Sense" or "I<br/>
smell  dead people".  Working S&amp;R, you develop a black sense of humor.<br/>
<br/>
So, they gave the dog the command to track and he led them to a well<br/>
concealed tupperware box!  Thinking that they had found someone's lost<br/>
property, they opened it looking for an address.  They discovered<br/>
Sampress had found his first letterbox!  They read the directions on<br/>
how to play our game, pressed the dog's paw onto the inkpad and had<br/>
Sampress "stamp" the book as the finder.  Underneath it, they wrote<br/>
"WNY Search and Rescue -- Thanks for the extra drill!" and replaced<br/>
everything back the way they found it.  The next time the owner checks<br/>
on his box, he's going to find an 'interesting stamp' :D<br/>
