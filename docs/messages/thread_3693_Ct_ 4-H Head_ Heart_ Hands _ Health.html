                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Cock-A-Doodle-Moo 4-H Club went out hiking on November12,2001. <br/>
They chose to take the Nipmuck trail and the group walked along they <br/>
checked on Silly Songs and Paw Print then  carefully crossed Clover <br/>
Mill Road. Still on the Nipmuck blue dot trail they were careful as <br/>
there are many trails with a rainbow of dot colors in this part of <br/>
the woods. Up away from the road they hiked. the group passed a <br/>
haunted tree whose branches have reached out for nearly a century. <br/>
Then onward  now passing a rotting tree. Down the trail in a chorus <br/>
of crunching leaves and children's voices. The group comes to a <br/>
crossroads in the trail and stops to read the sign post. many cross <br/>
country skiers will pass through here on  a hushed wintry day. The <br/>
children notice a very old landmark for the boundry of property. A <br/>
classic stacking of stones. Here in the quiet woodland at this place <br/>
marking the corner of a long forgotten farm the children tuck away a <br/>
momento of the day.  They scrambled over the wall and in  stony cairn <br/>
at the classic corner they placed the Head Heart, Hands , and Health <br/>
4-H Box. Good Luck in Searching. <br/>
