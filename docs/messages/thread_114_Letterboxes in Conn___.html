&gt; Ray aka. Otter be,<br/>
&gt; Just a guess, but I'll bet everyone on the list would be thrilled if<br/>
&gt; you participate by publishing to our site. <br/>

Let me second Dan's invite to this group!  It will be great to get<br/>
another NE state represented (we have VT, NH, and Mass), and, it sounds<br/>
like there is an active group already where you live.<br/>
<br/>
Tell us about it, please? How did you (all) get started? Was it from the<br/>
Smithsonian article or from somebody who went to Dartmoor?<br/>
<br/>
What have you found works or doesn't work with the letterboxes, clues,<br/>
stamps, etc. We'd ALL loke to know, I am sure.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting side note: ever wonder how the Smithsonian article came to<br/>
happen? Chris Granstrom, the author, told me that he heard about it from<br/>
another neighbor who had been to England, and HE followed up on the<br/>
idea, much as the rest of us have done following his article. I've not<br/>
yet tracked down that neighbor, but wouldn't he (she) be in for a<br/>
surprise, what that conversation with Chris led to?<br/>
