                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well...As for the Rock Creek Letterboxes...John and I went out last night<br/>
after work with our headlamp and flashlight and what should be right before<br/>
our eyes as we are headed for the starting point, but Wayne and his beloved<br/>
wife!  Should have known.  Serves me right thinking I should even try to<br/>
compete.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, he can get everything first.  If it involves rummaging around in the<br/>
dark past 9:00 o'clock and still coming up empty-handed, he can have it.  We<br/>
will probably go a-seeking this weekend during the light of day.  We looked<br/>
for Box #2 and we know we're right where we should be, but victory was not<br/>
achieved.  I have no patience, either, so that is a trait I need to acquire.<br/>
I must enjoy the rainbow, not the pot of gold at the end of it, right?<br/>
<br/>
So thrilled to see Box #3 posted and we will probably figure out the clues<br/>
and hunt for it, too, this weekend, I hope.  <br/>
<br/>
Much credit to Der Mad Stamper!  Clues for Boxes 1 &amp; 2 were really fun to<br/>
figure out.  If I could just ditch the compass and find the box I'd be in<br/>
heaven, but I guess it just doesn't work that way.  Wayne is in his glory<br/>
with these challenging clues.  If the race is on, he will always be the<br/>
winner, I think.  Thanks, Mitch for loads of letterboxing fun in the Pacific<br/>
NW!<br/>

You're pretty clever yourself... especially figuring the clues out <br/>
with ERRORS in them!!!!!   <br/>
<br/>
Both the 12th and 23rd letters in the 4th line were supposed to have <br/>
the number 71 under them, but I only managed to get the 7 there. <br/>
oops!!  I accidently marked over the 1 on my scratch sheet.<br/>
<br/>
I have made the corrections, and expect to hear of your successful <br/>
finds at Rock Creek Campus in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, since you said you wish you could just hunt the boxes <br/>
without having to use a compass... don't forget the Series of boxes <br/>
that Thom and I placed in various parks along Rock Creek. Maybe you <br/>
can make it out here during the weekend and bag both series... I <br/>
think that would make about 10 boxes altogether!!!<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>

days!  We've had the driest, nicest winter in ages and with Mitch<br/>
baiting us with great clues and new boxes how can we go wrong out<br/>
here?!!!  <br/>
<br/>
I thought after figuring the other two Rock Creek Campus clues this one<br/>
was the easiest.  Still...even though the clues are conquered, the<br/>
stamped images have not been and there is where it gets frustrating for<br/>
moi of little patience.  <br/>
<br/>
Still, I'm really, really eager to get out and score.  I do believe we<br/>
are going to get the other nearby Rock Creek ones, as well.  I even took<br/>
a crack at solving the Bronson Creek rebus I was so confident in myself<br/>
after figuring out the others, and I may even bend my mind to the will<br/>
of Warrior Rock.  We'll see, though.  I best not get too cocky.<br/>
Achieving the boxes takes a compass and a "WWMD" (What would Mitch Do)<br/>
mindset.   We all know how successful I've been with that so far.  HA!<br/>
How many times did I swear Mt. Tabor wasn't there.  I'm a joke of a<br/>
letterboxer....but I think I might be getting better as time goes on.<br/>
Thanks so much, Der Mad Stamper!  Still don't get the suicide question<br/>
and I know Wayne knows even though he won't tell.  I've tried every<br/>
letter I can think of, but I just don't get it.  Maybe I'm not so clever<br/>
after all.<br/>
<br/>
