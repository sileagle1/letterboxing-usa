and don't move an inch! I don't want anyone going anywhere until <br/>
somebody coughs up my freakin' PZ Kut!<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I should explain... last night something absolutely <br/>
dreadful happened!<br/>
<br/>
It started out pretty much as an ordinary night. I found a nice <br/>
little karaoke bar that I hadn't been to before. I went in around <br/>
ten, ordered a drink, and put my name on the list to sing a song. <br/>
About a half hour later, when they asked me to leave, I headed for <br/>
home. There was nothing good on TV and the lady next door had her <br/>
shades pulled down, so I went to bed early.<br/>
<br/>
But I woke up with a start when I heard the sound of screeching tires <br/>
outside my home. I looked at my alarm and saw that it was exactly 12 <br/>
midnight. I jumped out of bed and peeked through the curtains of my <br/>
bedroom window. There was no one in sight and my car was still parked <br/>
in the middle of my front lawn, so I went back to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Then, this morning, I got up and began my usual routine. I popped a <br/>
few aspirin, drank some Alka Seltzer, took a quick shower, and then <br/>
got undressed. After downing a cup of yogurt and a bottle of pale <br/>
ale, I started making my rounds. I fed my pufferfish, threw another <br/>
baby bunny into the snake cage, and filled my cat's dish with Cocoa <br/>
Pebbles. Then I went over to my special shrine to hug and kiss my <br/>
huge private stockpile of precious Grade A white PZ Kut carving <br/>
material.<br/>
<br/>
To my horror, I realized that my entire hoard was missing! Gone! <br/>
Vanished!<br/>
<br/>
Why would someone do this to me? Why did they have to take my Grade A <br/>
white PZ Kut, of all things? There's plenty of other stuff around my <br/>
house that is more valuable: my ex-wife's car... my ex-wife's <br/>
wardrobe... my ex-wife's prosthetic leg. Why would they take the one <br/>
thing that means so very much to me? Why me, Lord, why ME???<br/>
<br/>
It's not like anyone has any personal reason to attack me. Well, I <br/>
suppose there's that one guy down the block who used to have the <br/>
peekapoo... and then there was that little incident at the convent. <br/>
But, for the most part, I've lived a life of pure innocence and have <br/>
been an absolute model citizen. What could possibly motivate anyone <br/>
to do something so horrid and unspeakable to someone like me?<br/>
<br/>
I know it must have been one of you!<br/>
<br/>
Who else, but a letterboxer, would be driven to come into my home and <br/>
steal my beloved PZ Kut? You sick, obsessive, depraved scoundrels! <br/>
You will never get away with this!<br/>
<br/>
Whoever you are, I will stop at nothing to find you and expose you <br/>
for the villain that you are! I'm going to hire an investigator! I'm <br/>
going to hunt you down like an animal! Vengeance will be mine! I will <br/>
not sit quietly and be violated in this manner!<br/>
<br/>
Nobody... I repeat, NOBODY... goes letterboxing again until I find my <br/>
PZ Kut! Just stay where you are right this second and my investigator <br/>
will contact you shortly. Don't any of you move a muscle! You... <br/>
you... you freakin'... freaks!<br/>

Are you trying to sweet-talk me? Well, it's not gonna work! I don't <br/>
trust anyone! As far as I'm concerned, you're all suspects!<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I did call the police. They came over, dusted for prints, and <br/>
asked me to put my clothes back on again. Then they told me there's not <br/>
much they can do... incompetent fools!<br/>
<br/>
So, as promised, I've contacted an investigator to help me get to the <br/>
bottom of this. Whichever one of you did this will soon be behind bars!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I suppose I should explain... last night something absolutely <br/>
&gt; dreadful happened!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It started out pretty much as an ordinary night. I found a nice <br/>
&gt; little karaoke bar that I hadn't been to before. I went in around <br/>
&gt; ten, ordered a drink, and put my name on the list to sing a song. <br/>
&gt; About a half hour later, when they asked me to leave, I headed for <br/>
&gt; home. There was nothing good on TV and the lady next door had her <br/>
&gt; shades pulled down, so I went to bed early.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I woke up with a start when I heard the sound of screeching tires <br/>
&gt; outside my home. I looked at my alarm and saw that it was exactly 12 <br/>
&gt; midnight. I jumped out of bed and peeked through the curtains of my <br/>
&gt; bedroom window. There was no one in sight and my car was still parked <br/>
&gt; in the middle of my front lawn, so I went back to bed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then, this morning, I got up and began my usual routine. I popped a <br/>
&gt; few aspirin, drank some Alka Seltzer, took a quick shower, and then <br/>
&gt; got undressed. After downing a cup of yogurt and a bottle of pale <br/>
&gt; ale, I started making my rounds. I fed my pufferfish, threw another <br/>
&gt; baby bunny into the snake cage, and filled my cat's dish with Cocoa <br/>
&gt; Pebbles. Then I went over to my special shrine to hug and kiss my <br/>
&gt; huge private stockpile of precious Grade A white PZ Kut carving <br/>
&gt; material.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To my horror, I realized that my entire hoard was missing! Gone! <br/>
&gt; Vanished!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why would someone do this to me? Why did they have to take my Grade A <br/>
&gt; white PZ Kut, of all things? There's plenty of other stuff around my <br/>
&gt; house that is more valuable: my ex-wife's car... my ex-wife's <br/>
&gt; wardrobe... my ex-wife's prosthetic leg. Why would they take the one <br/>
&gt; thing that means so very much to me? Why me, Lord, why ME???<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's not like anyone has any personal reason to attack me. Well, I <br/>
&gt; suppose there's that one guy down the block who used to have the <br/>
&gt; peekapoo... and then there was that little incident at the convent. <br/>
&gt; But, for the most part, I've lived a life of pure innocence and have <br/>
&gt; been an absolute model citizen. What could possibly motivate anyone <br/>
&gt; to do something so horrid and unspeakable to someone like me?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know it must have been one of you!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Who else, but a letterboxer, would be driven to come into my home and <br/>
&gt; steal my beloved PZ Kut? You sick, obsessive, depraved scoundrels! <br/>
&gt; You will never get away with this!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Whoever you are, I will stop at nothing to find you and expose you <br/>
&gt; for the villain that you are! I'm going to hire an investigator! I'm <br/>
&gt; going to hunt you down like an animal! Vengeance will be mine! I will <br/>
&gt; not sit quietly and be violated in this manner!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nobody... I repeat, NOBODY... goes letterboxing again until I find my <br/>
&gt; PZ Kut! Just stay where you are right this second and my investigator <br/>
&gt; will contact you shortly. Don't any of you move a muscle! You... <br/>
&gt; you... you freakin'... freaks!<br/>

Mitch, are you serious?? Did someone *really* steal your Grade A White PZ <br/>
Kut?  How cruel!  Your theives may have been trying to get at the white <br/>
stuff here, too, since one of the boxes that just arrived was mangled <br/>
somewhere along the way (happily, it seems that they broke into the orange <br/>
box first, though, so they got discouraged and left the white material <br/>
unmolested!)<br/>
<br/>
And, just in case everyone doesn't know yet, I'm the new owner of <br/>
Stampeaz.com -- I bought it in January when Justin threatened to close it <br/>
down and make my favorite carving material unavailable.  That shows you <br/>
just how far some of us are willing to go to get a PZ Kut fix -- I <br/>
understand the theives' motivation!  ;-)  I came to letterboxing through <br/>
carving and printmaking and have a couple of boxes ready to plant over the <br/>
next couple of weeks.  I haven't done much boxing for a while, but now <br/>
that there is a lot more activity in my area, I'm getting excited about it <br/>
again.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content"> I bought a huge slab of white marshmallow today from a street vendor (wearing nothin' but a trench coat)! He called it PZ Kut, but I thought he was saying easy to cut. So I brought it home and cut a piece off to make a smore and folks, this stuff is NO GOOD! I just threw the rest in the garbage! So just some friendly advise: if a street vendor in a trenchcoat approaches you and tries to sell you some marshmallows - don't fall for it!<br/>

and don't move an inch! I don't want anyone going anywhere until <br/>
somebody coughs up my freakin' PZ Kut!<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I should explain... last night something absolutely <br/>
dreadful happened!<br/>
<br/>
It started out pretty much as an ordinary night. I found a nice <br/>
little karaoke bar that I hadn't been to before. I went in around <br/>
ten, ordered a drink, and put my name on the list to sing a song. <br/>
About a half hour later, when they asked me to leave, I headed for <br/>
home. There was nothing good on TV and the lady next door had her <br/>
shades pulled down, so I went to bed early.<br/>
<br/>
But I woke up with a start when I heard the sound of screeching tires <br/>
outside my home. I looked at my alarm and saw that it was exactly 12 <br/>
midnight. I jumped out of bed and peeked through the curtains of my <br/>
bedroom window. There was no one in sight and my car was still parked <br/>
in the middle of my front lawn, so I went back to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Then, this morning, I got up and began my usual routine. I popped a <br/>
few aspirin, drank some Alka Seltzer, took a quick shower, and then <br/>
got undressed. After downing a cup of yogurt and a bottle of pale <br/>
ale, I started making my rounds. I fed my pufferfish, threw another <br/>
baby bunny into the snake cage, and filled my cat's dish with Cocoa <br/>
Pebbles. Then I went over to my special shrine to hug and kiss my <br/>
huge private stockpile of precious Grade A white PZ Kut carving <br/>
material.<br/>
<br/>
To my horror, I realized that my entire hoard was missing! Gone! <br/>
Vanished!<br/>
<br/>
Why would someone do this to me? Why did they have to take my Grade A <br/>
white PZ Kut, of all things? There's plenty of other stuff around my <br/>
house that is more valuable: my ex-wife's car... my ex-wife's <br/>
wardrobe... my ex-wife's prosthetic leg. Why would they take the one <br/>
thing that means so very much to me? Why me, Lord, why ME???<br/>
<br/>
It's not like anyone has any personal reason to attack me. Well, I <br/>
suppose there's that one guy down the block who used to have the <br/>
peekapoo... and then there was that little incident at the convent. <br/>
But, for the most part, I've lived a life of pure innocence and have <br/>
been an absolute model citizen. What could possibly motivate anyone <br/>
to do something so horrid and unspeakable to someone like me?<br/>
<br/>
I know it must have been one of you!<br/>
<br/>
Who else, but a letterboxer, would be driven to come into my home and <br/>
steal my beloved PZ Kut? You sick, obsessive, depraved scoundrels! <br/>
You will never get away with this!<br/>
<br/>
Whoever you are, I will stop at nothing to find you and expose you <br/>
for the villain that you are! I'm going to hire an investigator! I'm <br/>
going to hunt you down like an animal! Vengeance will be mine! I will <br/>
not sit quietly and be violated in this manner!<br/>
<br/>
Nobody... I repeat, NOBODY... goes letterboxing again until I find my <br/>
PZ Kut! Just stay where you are right this second and my investigator <br/>
will contact you shortly. Don't any of you move a muscle! You... <br/>
you... you freakin'... freaks!<br/>

I forgot to take my sleep walking, psychotic-letterboxing medication  <br/>
last night again.<br/>
<br/>
Man I really hope that wasn't me.<br/>
<br/>
Last time I forgot to take my meeeedddication I was found curled up  <br/>
in a burlap bag under a freeway bridge with a, "This is NOT TRASH"  <br/>
sticker on my butt. They said when I was pulled out of those new  <br/>
GIANT ziplock bags I was all moist even though I had those desiccant  <br/>
Silicon Gel packs all over my inked-up body.<br/>
<br/>
Hint: Don't stick Silicon Gel packs all over your naked body with  <br/>
Gorilla Glue. Some weird chemical reaction that caused me to dry up  <br/>
like a week -old-left-open-in-the-sun ink pad and sprout a mess load  <br/>
of extra hair.<br/>
<br/>
Well, Mr. Der, I hope I haven't ruined your weekend but in defense of  <br/>
myself, I am unable to find the stash of PZKut White stuff in my  <br/>
plastic, hermetically sealed-except-where-that-rotten-squirrel-chewed- <br/>
a-hole, home. I did notice a new collection of Lock N Lock containers  <br/>
at wicked marked down prices from Stop &amp; Shop.<br/>
<br/>
If you find your White Stuff, I can use a small 1" square to add to  <br/>
my MAPS OF THE WORLD 1cm super-micro letterboxes. I seemed to have  <br/>
finished Singapore and Laos last night. That type still gets me though.<br/>

terrible were to happen to my precious PZ Kut... I don't know what <br/>
I'd do!!  I'm so frightened!<br/>

I begin to think that it cannot be a carver of any kind who has stolen the <br/>
precious PZ Kut.  No carver would threaten to *shred* the material!  Carve <br/>
it into a pile of stamps and liberally sprinkle them through the <br/>
countryside, perhaps, but shred??  Never!  Therefore, you may <br/>
need to cast your dragnet beyond this group....<br/>

I take it, then, that you don't approve of my method of using my <br/>
