This is a moderately hard set of clues in that they don't give you much hint<br/>
of the somewhat dramatic landscape change over the course of 24 km and 550<br/>
meters in elevation you will experience from start to finish.<br/>
<br/>
The search begins in Capitan, Lincoln County, New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere near Capitan, NM, fire fighters found a little black bear cub,<br/>
burned and frightened, clinging to a tree.  Dubbed Smokey and kept for all<br/>
the rest of his life at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., the bear<br/>
symbolized the National Forest Service's anti-fire campaign and had<br/>
relatives who roamed the neighborhood of this letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
To find it and retrieve an impression of the little Smokey stamp, start at<br/>
the Smokey Bear Museum on US Highway 380 in downtown Capitan, NM.  You might<br/>
get a bite to eat at the Smokey Bear Cafe just down the street--a plate of<br/>
enchiladas smothered in green chile sauce and a cup of coffee eaten slowly<br/>
to better absorb the character of the community. When your ready to begin<br/>
the search in earnest, head southwest until you strike the Rio Bonito and<br/>
follow it upstream past the drowned mining town--it must have been beautiful<br/>
in its heyday.  No doubt Billy the Kid rode up into these mountains on<br/>
occassion, unless the fear of Apaches and bears kept the little killer down<br/>
around Lincoln.  When you strike the South fork, take it.  You are almost<br/>
there when you leave your wheels at N 33 26.79 W 105 45.30. Cross the log<br/>
bridge and keep hot on the trail until you arrive at the remnants of an old<br/>
homestead. The trail splits around the old cabin.  Stop at the cabin and<br/>
look around, you are within 100 meters of your destination.<br/>

What great advice, subtle yet profound.<br/>
Another bites the dust? I assume that you mean another letterbox-defecit<br/>
just gained it's first, so, way to go!<br/>
