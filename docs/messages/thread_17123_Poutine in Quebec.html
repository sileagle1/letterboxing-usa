Bummer!  I sort of carved almost a similar stamp (I'm not that good) and looked for a way to 'Contact the Placer', but there isn't one.  We'll happily adopt the box and check on it each time we go up.  The Poutine listing is off the main LBNA Home Page, though.  Should we re-enter the clues, or is there a way to just kind of shift them over?  Does anyone see/talk to the original placer?<br/>
<br/>
Dunno.  What do you think?<br/>
