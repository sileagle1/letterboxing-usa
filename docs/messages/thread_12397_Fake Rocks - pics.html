<br/>
I am continuing my quest for THE perfect fake rock.  I am also having <br/>
fun doing it. This week I used two fake rocks (the grey ones) for <br/>
microboxes in my Middle Earth series. These are the sort of <br/>
papermache' made with plaster variety. I sprayed them with some dark <br/>
granite faux stone paint. I also just bought some acrylic paints to <br/>
mix in with the stuff when it is mushy still. Show you that when I do <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I also have pics of the brownish red stuff that is oven hardening <br/>
clay. I have not baked it, yet. I have hopes for that.<br/>
<br/>
These pics are at <br/>
http://webpages.charter.net/astroweaver/letterboxing/letterbox.html<br/>
<br/>
I am also going to Dremel out (hey, did I just verb that proper <br/>
noun?) some rather porous rock I just bought. Will show that when I <br/>
get somewhere with it.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the Middle Earth series now has six boxes planted. Hope <br/>
some of you bright folk will decode clues and find them. Actually, I <br/>
am hoping to sucker Ryan in to working on the entire series and then <br/>
make one so hard he goes stark raving mad trying to find it. That is <br/>
ungratious of me, I know. Still I think revenge is a letterbox best <br/>
served up cold. Teehee!<br/>

when you 'fire' them? Or do they turn a rock like color? I was in the craft<br/>
store yesterday &amp; saw that Femo comes in lots of colors. I know I used it at<br/>
camp a few years ago, but don't recall if it started white or turned white.<br/>
We made our dog's paw prints in it &amp; it was amazing how much detail it<br/>
picked up (even the hair between and around the dog's toes and 'grain' of<br/>
their pads!).<br/>

I also wanted to say I love your tag line! It makes me laugh. &lt; My uncle<br/>
