<p>Airline Hampton Station</p></b>

<p>Rated: Easy</p>
<p>Take Route 6 to the intersection of 6 and 97. Take Route 97 through Hampton 
Center. Go through this historic town center. Remember to keep your speed down. 
Low speed limits on this road. Keep going on Route 97. You will see the Hampton 
Elementary School on the right. Take the next left onto Station Road. Stay on 
Station Road avoid turning off onto other roads. After a while you will come to 
the intersection of New Hill Road and Station Road. There will be a white house 
on the left and the old rail road bed crosses the road after that house. On the 
right you will see what looks like a very large old wooden barn and usually a 
few truck trailers in the yard. This was the site of the old Hampton Station. 
This area was once filled with activity due to the train station. You may park 
your car on the left side of the road on the old railroad line property. There 
is also a post with a black number 12 on a orange background. The old railroad 
line is state property and is considered a linear park open to the public. 
Follow the rail line on the side of the road in which you parked your car. As 
you travel along the line which is as wide as a dirt road, the line curves 
gradually to the right. You will pass between 2 swamps. A large one on the right 
and a small one on the left. Here you have a good chance to observe wildlife 
activity. I have seen many different birds and other wildlife here. It’s also 
one of Molly’s favorite swimming holes. You come to the end of the left swamp. 
Keep going. You come to the end of the right swamp. Keep going. As you go along 
you will pass a path as wide as a road on the left followed quickly by a smaller 
path on the left. Keep going. You will pass a path on your right with no 
trespassing signs. A bit further you will notice a stone wall up a small hill on 
the left side. The wall will turn at a 90 degree angle to the left followed 
quickly by a 90 degree angle to the right. There you will see a huge boulder. 
The front of the rock facing you has an overhang which a person could fit under 
lying down. You will have to cross a ditch and go uphill to this huge boulder. 
Under this overhang where the boulder touches a tree you will find a couple 
rocks under the over hanging boulder. Under these two rocks is the object of you 
quest. Bring your own stamp pad. One way walk should take about 20 minutes but 
take your time and enjoy the view. <span class="370131405-13012002">R</span>emember the Air Line Railroad and the famous 
Ghost train that traveled this route on it’s way to Boston or Willimantic.
