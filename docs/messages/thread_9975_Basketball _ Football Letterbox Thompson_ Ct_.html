Football Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Placed: 1-1-03<br/>
Placed by: Teach &amp; Preach<br/>
Rated: easy 10-15 mins.<br/>
Location: Thompson Ct. Windham County<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From Rt. 12 North (Exit 98 395North) turn left onto main<br/>
street, after sharp turn to the right will be a left onto Reardon Rd.<br/>
At the Y go right onto Red Bridge Rd.  Park along the Little League<br/>
Field or if gate is up you can park inside the park by the basketball<br/>
courts.<br/>
Myself and my brothers would get together with friends and play some<br/>
great basketball here.  We would pretend to be the 86 Celtics Team.<br/>
Then I was the shortest, now I'm the tallest, and they don't win to many<br/>
games.  At the basketball hoop furthest away from the road take a<br/>
reading of 245 degrees.  Walk over the the small boulders, in between<br/>
the two of them is your Basketball Letterbox.  I played in a basketball<br/>
league here with 5 other teams, ours came in last.  Still some great<br/>
memories.  <br/>
  Go to the lower baseball fields to your right.  Head toward the green<br/>
flag pole in center field.  We used to play football here and use the<br/>
fencing as out of bounds markers.  Hit it a few times, almost was<br/>
knocked out once, but will still play anytime.  Head past the score<br/>
board in right field and head up the hill.  At this baseball field (no<br/>
stories here, never did anything in this field) head to the left, to the<br/>
scoreboard in center field.  Take a reading of 135 degrees.  go into the<br/>
woods (should be a small path) to a pine tree with a stump on the side<br/>
of it.  Behind the stump covers with sticks is the Football Letterbox.<br/>
Have fun and be safe.<br/>
