                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, Letterboxers, I am up for this challenge!  I would<br/>
love to put together a collection of stories for all<br/>
to enjoy.  If you would be willing to share, I would<br/>
be willing to collect, collate, and make the effort to<br/>
publish.  Since I teach full time (times ten!)I would<br/>
do this as time would allow.  I would also like to try<br/>
and market this effort.  Bearing (;-) this in mind,<br/>
share if you don't have a problem with my using your<br/>
experiences for a potential profit.  If there is no<br/>
market for the work, then I'd still do it.  I love to<br/>
write, and I love the energy that I feel from the<br/>
messages on this listserve, so it would be a labor of<br/>
love.  However, if I can make a buck (;-) then that<br/>
would be frosting on a cake for me.  I think it would<br/>
behoove me to ask you to send your stories to me<br/>
personally.   I have a school address:<br/>
kuzykl@cps.sad44.org<br/>
That address has a faster connection than the one I<br/>
have at home, so it would be easier for me to access<br/>
them there.  I hope you are up for this.  I see it as<br/>
something that would be historic as well as<br/>
entertaining.  The stories don't have to be stories of<br/>
near disaster, either.  They could run the gamut. For<br/>
example, there is a letterbox in Brunswick, Maine that<br/>
made me cry.  The story behind it and the stamp and<br/>
ink color are truly beautiful.  Many things can happen<br/>
in the process of creating, planting, finding, and<br/>
meeting others.  The sky's the limit!  Thanks ahead of<br/>
time.  I hope you are willing to share with me.  Linda<br/>
