one of yours is still there. just this past month i have found seacoast1, <br/>

 it was still there. i never did find the one at the cemetery the first time<br/>
so it could very well not be there or be there. <br/>

<br/>
I just returned from a (real) "ghost hunt" in New Orleans, and I was<br/>
thrilled to find out that some of my letterboxes are still in NH! <br/>
Thanks, Uneksia!<br/>
<br/>
I know that someone had refurbished the Seacoast #1 box, but had heard<br/>
that it had gone missing... perhaps the person just couldn't find it. <br/>
It is a tricky one to find, especially if you're trying to be discreet<br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also delighted that the Gilson Road one is still there; I'd heard<br/>
that the cemetery one was missing, but it wasn't especially<br/>
well-hidden, so that's no surprise since it was a hand-carved stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the updates... I'll be back online tomorrow and change the<br/>
info on my webpages.<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully,<br/>
Aisling<br/>
