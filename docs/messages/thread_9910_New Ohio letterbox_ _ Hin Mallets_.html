Letterbox: "Hin Mallets" placed by Salamander on 12-29-02. Location: <br/>
Chillicothe, Ross County, Ohio. Difficulty: Easy.  A TRUE STORY: Once <br/>
upon a time,a future letterboxer was visiting with a favorite aunt. <br/>
Now, this aunt had an unusual way with words,and during the <br/>
conversation, she happened to mention that there were certainly a lot <br/>
of hin mallets in the city park lately.Now, the F.L. didn't know what <br/>
a hin mallet was, but was determined to find out. So after several <br/>
trips to the park, the F.L. finally noticed that there were an awful <br/>
lot of ducks on the park lake. Mallard ducks. Female mallard ducks. <br/>
Hen Mallards!!! If you wish to see a hin mallet, follow the clues <br/>
below .  CLUES: Start at the Oldaker picnic shelter in Yoctangee <br/>
Park.When standing at the norhteast side of the shelter, you can see <br/>
a stairway at 52 degrees. Go to the top of this stairway.At the top <br/>
of the stairs, if you look straight ahead, you can see a Pin Oak tree <br/>
at the bottom of the slope in front of you. Go to that tree, then go <br/>
41 paces at 360 degrees. Under a fork in the west end of a fallen <br/>
log, you can find a hin mallet!<br/>
