<div>Developing your own design is best, but I am one of those 
who carve my fingers more than the eraser.  A good source for a custom made 
stamp is your local engraving store or trophy store.  EskieLover and I had 
one for a while, and had a stamp press.  You make your custom 
artwork.  This is scanned into the computer, digitized for the engraving 
machine, a mold is engraved, and the mold pressed into the heated rubber to make 
the stamp.  If you work with the engraver, the scanned artwork can be 
edited before engraving the mold.  If you go to a stationary (sp) store or 
some such, they have the local engraving shop make it for them and add their 
cost.  The stamp would be your personal design, you just had someone else 
make it into a stamp.  You can get just the rubber stamp and glue it 
to your own backing.</div>
