&gt;   Hi,<br/>
&gt; I do agree with this - it is better to have clues listed on both sites.<br/>
&gt; But out of respect shouldn't we practice what we preach. We are asking<br/>
&gt; people who prefer AQ to log their clues on LbNA as well. Before we ask<br/>
&gt; them to do that shouldn't we list our clues on AQ first. I noticed<br/>
&gt; that Silver Eagle wants all clues on LbNA but he has only four of his<br/>
&gt; boxes listed on AQ. I feel it is disrespectful to demand something of<br/>
&gt; others that we aren't willing to do ourselves. I usually check both<br/>
&gt; sites when I am looking for clues because I know there are people who<br/>
&gt; prefer one site over the other. If and only if we are willing to list<br/>
&gt; on both sites can we ask others to do the same.<br/>
&gt; Respectfully,<br/>
