<br/>Since this is a microbox, please bring a stamp pad and pen with you.  Please take the box to a remote location to stamp in, then return it to its spot.  Please do not ask the people who work here, as they do not know anything about the box or boxing in general.  Also, when retrieving the box, please be sure no one is watching, especially from your right!  BTW... you can only access this box at the following times:  Monday through Thursday 9 am - 9 pm and Friday &amp; Saturday 9 am - 5 pm
<br/>
<br/>Mary was SO excited!  She and her husband were taking a trip on a steamboat ship to England for a holiday!  Mary's husband's family owned a silk and ribbon business in town, which was quite successful.  Before leaving on her trip, she wanted to do some research on the area first.  If she were to do this research today, she would find some information about Dartmoor at 914.2.  (However, don't look for any information about Dartmoor here.... they don't have any)  To find the information you desire, when you find the numbers 914.2, look to the bottom shelf and just to the left underneath the second shelf from the bottom to find what you are looking for.
