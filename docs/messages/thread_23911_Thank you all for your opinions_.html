appreciate the feedback, and will not start up a file on the egroup <br/>
for suspect letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, in the dark, I scurried over to the park to check on the <br/>
rest of the series.  All was well, and well hidden with the <br/>
remaining boxes - seems another boxer (who has not yet logged a find <br/>
on AQ) came along after the "suspect" and this person did a fabulous <br/>
job rehiding.  <br/>
<br/>
An aside:  One box is in the hollow of a pine tree, about 2 feet off <br/>
the ground on a little "ledge" within the hollow.  I dug out it, <br/>
went back to my car to read the log, replaced the missing ziploc <br/>
baggie, and then went back and replaced it, covering it with wedged-<br/>
in sticks, pine cones and some needles.  Jumped back in the car to <br/>
drive to the next box.  (hey, it's dark - I'm not walking around in <br/>
a city park alone at night!)  Almost there, and I notice that my <br/>
thumb ring is gone!  Eeep!  Turned around, drove back, got the <br/>
flashlight out.  Went back to the tree and dug the box back out - <br/>
sure enough, there's my ring, nestled in the pine needles.  Note to <br/>
self - take off rings when boxing in the cold!  ;-p<br/>
