letterboxed here in Southern New England. Visiting www.letterboxing.org is<br/>
the best way to get the clues, but you can also check out the EMS store in<br/>
the Crystal Mall (no commercial affiliation here....). Those folks have been<br/>
great about putting the word out and they have a nice binder with about 30<br/>
letterbox clue sheets all xerox'ed and ready to go for you, as well as great<br/>
trail guide books, compasses, and maps.<br/>

There are only a few handmade stamps scattered around here: most are<br/>
commercially made over-the-counter, off-the-rack types, but as Tom says,<br/>
it's easier than it sounds and really quite addicting to create your own.<br/>
But don't feel like you HAVE to!<br/>

I missed those Norwich Bulletin articles and will have to hit the library to<br/>
see them. Do you remember the date (more or less), or even the month?<br/>
