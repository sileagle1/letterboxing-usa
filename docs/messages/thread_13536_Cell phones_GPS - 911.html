<br/>
When you dial 911 from a land line they instantly know where you are <br/>
calling from using caller ID.  They can send help even if you can't <br/>
talk.  <br/>
<br/>
The 911 people are frustrated and concerned every day when they get <br/>
911 calls from cell phones and do not have this capibility.  "Can <br/>
you tell me where you are?"  "I'm on a cell phone and I don't know <br/>
where I am."  <br/>
<br/>
To solve this, sometime in the near future, all cell phones will be <br/>
required to include enough GPS circuitry to transmit the location of <br/>
the caller to 911.  Perhaps you will be able to opt out with a code <br/>
just like you can turn off caller ID.<br/>

"Hey DrewClan.  I see where you are on my caller ID/GPS program.  <br/>
What makes you think the letterbox is over that way?  You must have <br/>
made a wrong turn after the creek crossing."<br/>
<br/>
Now the GAP example was probably just a computerized receiver that <br/>
listened for passing cell phones dialed them back.  Pretty <br/>
interesting.  I saw a movie where you walk into the GAP and the <br/>
computer greeter says, "Welcome back M. Soandso.  Did those button <br/>
fly jeans work for you?  They are on sale this week."<br/>

&gt; &gt; Cell phone 911 is great provided you know EXACTLY where you are. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Services like cingular offer GPS enhancements but its not that <br/>
&gt; easy, <br/>
&gt; &gt; because the responders need the GPS features to find you!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've been wondering about that because of The Sopranos. Seems that <br/>
&gt; Tony and all the bada-bingers steal a new cell number every day <br/>
&gt; because supposedly the Feds can track where they are when the cell <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, this mother's day weekend we were shopping on 5th Ave in the <br/>
&gt; great NYC, and as we walked by The Gap, M's cell rang. It was <br/>
(gasp!) <br/>
&gt; an automated advertisement from The Gap. Too freaky!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, how can I get your cell phone to ring when you're near my <br/>
newest <br/>
&gt; mystery box?<br/>

e911 does not specifically require GPS to be used to track down a<br/>
caller. In populated areas you can get pretty close to someone's<br/>
location by the cell tower they're using. That's probably what the<br/>
Sopranos are worried about in a "Hollywood" way. <br/>

That was Minority Report (2002) when Detective John Anderton (Tom<br/>
Cruise) had his eyes replaced. They used "Hollywood" futuristic eye<br/>
scanning technology to determine (incorrectly) who the customer was.<br/>
<br/>
Advertising has been widely hyped for location-based applications - but<br/>
the difficulty with signal lock and privacy concerns will make this a<br/>
difficult leap for cell phone manufacturers and service providers. It's<br/>
just too difficult to justify.<br/>
