Leaving North Carolina, I headed to Utah for the 3rd Annual Park City Food &amp; Wine Classic. Three days of adulterated bliss. I would have invited Hikers and Hounds; thought about it real hard. Decided all that adulterated bliss would corrupt the Dude.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, arriving a week or two before the anticipated event, I wandered through the sites of Utah. Gilgal Garden was a wonder. Has a foot that once upon a time had a sock on it. Barefoot Lucy came to town, and the sock disappeared. Check it out if you are in the neighborhood. <br/>
<br/>
Sightseeing and wine tasting behind me, I put on a good suit and headed off to Springville for the 34th Annual Quilt Show. Let me tell you, the judging was not easy. By the way, thanks for the pocket money Sewsowbizzy. Sorry I could not convince the other judges that you were a Utahn at heart.  But I did not come here to talk about wine, feet or quilts; I came here to talk letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
For a western state Utah is about average with around 250 listed letterboxes. However there are only two, very lonely, mysteries. Hikers, make sure you are prepared, take plenty of water and, for safety's sake, know your terrain. Stay away from those cheap containers; they will not withstand the Utah winters. Closing ziplocks seems to be a problem for those in Utah. Maybe you can practice with your leftovers at home. Not a lot of letterboxes in the state outside of Moab and Salt Lake City, however seems that might be changing. Where are the mysteries? Come on Utah you can do better! All in all letterboxing in Utah was a pleasure, keep them coming. <br/>

First of all, socks fade.  Especially when they are stuck on some statue and<br/>
exposed to the elements for a long period of time.  What color do you think<br/>
purple might fade to?  Putrid pink - of course.  And given that many boxers<br/>
can testify to my remaining sock being vibrant purple, I think that goes<br/>
toward proof that the sock in Gilgal Garden WAS mine!<br/>
<br/>
The other proof was that the word "left" was written in faded permanent<br/>
marker on the bottom of the toe, and it matched in penmanship and pen the<br/>
word "right" written on the bottom of the toe of the sock I had been<br/>
wearing.  THAT might have been the source of the ribbing by other boxers,<br/>
because THEY thought I should have had the word "North" written on both<br/>
toes...<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of boxers, I wonder if you happen to have known IRA Boxer, that<br/>
dastardly boxer from Texas that met his demise because of his uncivil<br/>
behavior?  And did you ever SEE his boxers?  They were quite a sight!  But -<br/>
where were you when a REAL crime happened?  Now there's a mystery!<br/>

Next time might I suggest you follow the advice of knowledgeable boxers and label your toes "North". Every self-respecting boxer knows that is the correct direction. If you had abided by respected rules, perhaps the Gilgal Garden foot would not have mistaken your sock for his.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of feet, on the date in question, December 6, 2007, I was visiting a more gentle state than that of the great Texas. I did hear about the murder of poor IRA Boxer and was prepared to offer my assistance. However I heard that Detective Gandolph de Grey was in charge of the case and had discovered a footprint in the mud. Being as this foot print was bare, I figured he would solve the case quite quickly.<br/>

  &gt; &gt; &gt; My Fellow Letterboxers,<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; Leaving North Carolina, I headed to Utah for the 3rd Annual Park<br/>
  City Food &amp; Wine Classic. Three days of adulterated bliss. I would have<br/>
  invited Hikers and Hounds; thought about it real hard. Decided all that<br/>
  adulterated bliss would corrupt the Dude.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, arriving a week or two before the anticipated event, I<br/>
  wandered through the sites of Utah. Gilgal Garden was a wonder. Has a<br/>
  foot that once upon a time had a sock on it. Barefoot Lucy came to town,<br/>
  and the sock disappeared. Check it out if you are in the neighborhood.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; Sightseeing and wine tasting behind me, I put on a good suit and<br/>
  headed off to Springville for the 34th Annual Quilt Show. Let me tell<br/>
  you, the judging was not easy. By the way, thanks for the pocket money<br/>
  Sewsowbizzy. Sorry I could not convince the other judges that you were a<br/>
  Utahn at heart. But I did not come here to talk about wine, feet or<br/>
  quilts; I came here to talk letterboxing.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; For a western state Utah is about average with around 250 listed<br/>
  letterboxes. However there are only two, very lonely, mysteries. Hikers,<br/>
  make sure you are prepared, take plenty of water and, for safety's sake,<br/>
  know your terrain. Stay away from those cheap containers; they will not<br/>
  withstand the Utah winters. Closing ziplocks seems to be a problem for<br/>
  those in Utah. Maybe you can practice with your leftovers at home. Not a<br/>
  lot of letterboxes in the state outside of Moab and Salt Lake City,<br/>
  however seems that might be changing. Where are the mysteries? Come on<br/>
  Utah you can do better! All in all letterboxing in Utah was a pleasure,<br/>
  keep them coming.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; Sincerely,<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

Do you really believe the letterboxing community to be so naive as to believe your tale? Of course, I whispered promises of you winning that fabulous prize. I will not deny it. And although it cannot be denied that you are the Quilting Diva, it is with much sorrow (not to mention a now empty pocket) that the judges just weren't buying it. <br/>

This can be annoying however read below copy and pasted.<br/>
<br/>
However, because of the difficult terrain, the current spot recognized as the Four Corners was chosen. It's nearly 2 and a half miles west from the actual spot. <br/>
All four states, and the U.S. Congress, recognized the mistake but decided to allow the current boundary lines to be drawn. That means Utah lost some land, while Colorado gained some. <br/>
<br/>
"What is legal is political, not scientific," Case said. "And it doesn't matter if you make a mistake or not." <br/>
Since all the states and the U.S. Congress agreed on the boundaries, it is now the official boundary, which means all those families who take their pictures at the monument are doing so in four states and don't have to climb that plateau to be in the historical spot. <br/>
"Yes. Legally, it counts,"<br/>
