Last time on Nick Danger:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nick Danger was staking out the Boddy mansion hoping to learn something new about the Death of a Salesman when he discovered that other detectives were doing the same. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly a shot rang out! A woman screamed!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
September 2, 1935<br/>
<br/>
Friday<br/>
<br/>
11:59pm<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A woman screamed. A shot rang out. Our first instinct was to jump up and run to the scene.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wait! I yelled. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You think we should stay back before the killer realizes were here, and escapes? asked Detective Nevis. Thats clear headed thinking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No. My foots asleep and trapped under a root. Oww!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All the lights suddenly turned on in the mansion and several on the grounds.  The front door opened. A woman in black appeared at the door. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ollie, ollie, in come free! she shouted.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Huh?! replied dozens of muffled voices from the shrubbery. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know all you famous private detectives and letterboxers are out there hiding and watching. You might as well come join us. Everyones here. We can have that end of the novel big denouement scene. You know where the detective gathers all the suspects and announces, What the murderer failed to realize was ... and No one suspects the real murderer is... So come on out back. I have a pavilion for us out back in the park. Its a party. I guess you people call it a gather.<br/>

Heads popped up sheepishly over the hedges all around the grounds. I gawked foolishly at all the famous detectives there. Such great impressions:<br/>
