building" hitchhiker?  The Hitchhiker Portal doesn't seem to list<br/>
owners, although one might draw conclusions about the first reported<br/>
finder.  In this case it appears to be "legerdemaine opus 86".  That<br/>
looks more like a box title than a letterboxer's trail name to me.<br/>
<br/>
The HH only says "ELVIS" on it.  I think it's come to be known as<br/>
"ELVIS has left the building" because there's another ELVIS HH out there.<br/>
<br/>
The stamp is really beautiful.<br/>
