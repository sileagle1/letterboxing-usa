Welcome to the club. We east coasters will particularly await the <br/>
appearance of a Long Island letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
You know, I'm just realizing that I've lived on the east coast for 50 <br/>
years, in different locales, and have never once been on Long Island.<br/>
<br/>
That's one nice thing about letterboxing. It gets you off your duff <br/>
and out to places you wonder why you never visited before!<br/>

 I just wanted to write you to introduce myself. My name is Ed Bourne and I<br/>
live on Long Island, NY. I just found out about letterboxing last week!<br/>
 As I walked into my lunchroom at work, there was an April 1998 issue of<br/>
Smithsonian magazine open on one of the tables. I read the title of the<br/>
article, "They live and breathe Letterboxing". I was really intrigued, (I<br/>
thought it was about the letterbox format for movies at first). As I read<br/>
the article I was really taken by this hobby these people had. So when I got<br/>
home I did what I usually do when I what to know more about something, I did<br/>
an internet search and found you guys. Well I was a little disappointed to<br/>
find there were no letterboxes nearby, but I decided to get the ball rolling<br/>
here, and perhaps be the first on LI to plant one of these boxes. I have<br/>
almost all the materials needed, but no stamp yet. I would like to make my<br/>
own (I made two this weekend practicing, with pretty good results), but I<br/>
found a lot of nice ones at the arts &amp; crafts store here. So I scheduled a<br/>
vacation day next week to take a hike in one of the state parks here and<br/>
hide my first letterbox. I will e-mail you the clues when I get home :-)<br/>

Happy hunting,<br/>

I make fairly regular business trips up ro NYC, and have toyed with the idea of planting a box up there, but I'm struggling a bit with the idea (I doesn't exactly fit my preconceived notion of letterboxing).  I think I can make it happen sometime though. maybe Central Park i, who knows.  I'll keep everybody posted.  i guess there's no reason city dwellers can't have a little fun.<br/>

Any stamp will work, but personally I'd rather find one of your practice <br/>
stamps than a store-bought one.  Don't worry about how it looks.  Some of us <br/>
have placed stamps that got carved backwards, or had parts accidentally <br/>
sliced off.  Recently, I placed a stamp that had the wrong year carved on it <br/>
(for an explanation, you'll have to come up here and find the box!!)  Don't <br/>
worry about it.  The point is not to prove how great an artist you are, but <br/>
to provide a stamp that is unique... one-of-a-kind.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2-cents worth,<br/>

I tend to agree exactly with these sentiments expressed by Mitch.<br/>
        This was discussed extensively about a year ago - there are some<br/>
very<br/>
creative things that CAN be done with redi-made store-bought stamps, and<br/>
perhaps some creative selection will enable you to find a stamp that<br/>
"relates" to the location in some maner. <br/>
        However, a hand-carved stamp is unique to that one box - there<br/>
are all<br/>
kinds of carving skill levels out there - it is important to relax and<br/>
enjoy the product of your own labors - nobody is judging you for<br/>
"artistic merit".<br/>
        BTW, we (Susan and I) placed a double-sided stamp last summer -<br/>
the<br/>
captain of our ship was getting impatient, and thus, one side of the<br/>
stamp has backward text. It never made the web page, but (hopefully) it<br/>
awaits......<br/>

Yes I am!!<br/>
<br/>
I agree that there's nothing wrong with putting a store-bought stamp in a <br/>
letterbox.  Being der Mad Stamper dat I am, I absolutely adore stamps of all <br/>
kinds!!!  Sorry if I gave der wrong impression... pun not intended  :-)<br/>
<br/>
But, since Ed mentioned that he had already tried his hand at carving, I <br/>
wanted to encourage him to not be overly critical of his work.  All stamps is <br/>
good stamps!!!  Even if they don't turn out quite like you'd hoped... even if <br/>
they just have a few letters, or a silhouette, or an unidentifiable blob.  <br/>
But by all means, if you find something in a store that you really like, make <br/>
a letterbox out of it!!!  (Then make ANOTHER letterbox out of your attempt at <br/>
carving!!)<br/>
<br/>
Deborah, you can yank my leash ANYTIME!!!  ... 'scuse me if I drool a little <br/>
and chew on your shoes.  :-)<br/>

&gt;Way to go Ed. Just dive right on in!.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I make fairly regular business trips up ro NYC, and have toyed with the <br/>
&gt;idea of planting a box up there, but I'm struggling a bit with the idea (I <br/>
&gt;doesn't exactly fit my preconceived notion of letterboxing).  I think I can <br/>
&gt;make it happen sometime though. maybe Central Park i, who knows.  I'll keep <br/>
&gt;everybody posted.  i guess there's no reason city dwellers can't have a <br/>
&gt;little fun.<br/>

&gt;Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt;  I just wanted to write you to introduce myself. My name is Ed Bourne and <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;live on Long Island, NY. I just found out about letterboxing last week!<br/>
&gt;  As I walked into my lunchroom at work, there was an April 1998 issue of<br/>
&gt;Smithsonian magazine open on one of the tables. I read the title of the<br/>
&gt;article, "They live and breathe Letterboxing". I was really intrigued, (I<br/>
&gt;thought it was about the letterbox format for movies at first). As I read<br/>
&gt;the article I was really taken by this hobby these people had. So when I <br/>
&gt;got<br/>
&gt;home I did what I usually do when I what to know more about something, I <br/>
&gt;did<br/>
&gt;an internet search and found you guys. Well I was a little disappointed to<br/>
&gt;find there were no letterboxes nearby, but I decided to get the ball <br/>
&gt;rolling<br/>
&gt;here, and perhaps be the first on LI to plant one of these boxes. I have<br/>
&gt;almost all the materials needed, but no stamp yet. I would like to make my<br/>
&gt;own (I made two this weekend practicing, with pretty good results), but I<br/>
&gt;found a lot of nice ones at the arts &amp; crafts store here. So I scheduled a<br/>
&gt;vacation day next week to take a hike in one of the state parks here and<br/>
&gt;hide my first letterbox. I will e-mail you the clues when I get home :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Happy hunting,<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;'scuse me while I yank on Der Mad Stamper's leash again :-}<br/>
&gt;and express another opinion. While a handcarved stamp is a <br/>
&gt;worthwhile goal, don't feel compelled to put one in a letterbox <br/>
&gt;for any reason! If you find a commercial stamp that speaks to<br/>
&gt;the letterbox theme or placement, that would be excellent! <br/>
&gt;I'd be thrilled to find it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'd support that view..its better to be a Letterboxer than be inhibited by<br/>
"carver-twitch"....<br/>
<br/>
Its clear that the US version of Letterboxing has grown out of an arts and<br/>
crafts movement whereas in the UK its much more "gung-ho"....<br/>
<br/>
Dont forget you can always draw something...or use a nice graphics tool<br/>
(software) ..great for letters in a circle for example ...or combine the<br/>
two and take your print out to a "stamp-in-an-hour" shop and get quite a<br/>
nice stamp made quite cheaply...about 10 dolars I'd guess in the UK<br/>
equivalent...(6 pound or so incl tax at 17.5%)  depending on size...<br/>
<br/>
OK they are not very robust (plastic handle an all) but they are fine for<br/>
letterboxing...(they dont get much use <chuckle>)<br/>

Love to see that Mixt Media on the list...and yep I still owe you that<br/>
stuff..in the post this week I promise !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mitch says  :<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
I<br/>
&gt;  have placed stamps that got carved backwards, or had parts accidentally <br/>
&gt;&gt;  sliced off.  Recently, I placed a stamp that had the wrong year carved<br/>
&gt;on <br/>
&gt;it <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I'm not certain what year it is either ...since 1066 all the years seemed<br/>
to blur together...must be old age ...<g><br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;  (for an explanation, you'll have to come up here and find the box!!)  <br/>
&gt;Don't <br/>
&gt;&gt;  worry about it.  The point is not to prove how great an artist you<br/>
&gt;are, <br/>
&gt;but <br/>
&gt;&gt;  to provide a stamp that is unique... one-of-a-kind.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do agree with that one...be creative and enjoy it !.....If you want to<br/>
celebrate your dog's 4th bithday ..then jus' do it...Today is Paddington<br/>
Bears's Birthday (Mitch did you know that !!! 25th June !) for example....<br/>
<br/>
[Mitch is a Paddington fan I believe...see his kids page and you'll see]<br/>
<br/>
Look at Ray Aucote's pages on the web....cant recall its address ...you'll<br/>
see his dogs stamps on the page !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They were from a photo with text from a wp package.....<br/>
<br/>
Then the stamp was commercially made for him...ie he paid someone to put<br/>
it on to rubber...but it is unique....<br/>
<br/>
The trick is...and this is just also my 2cents worth too.so no offence<br/>
intended to anyone...<br/>
<br/>
I'd say   .......... imho....... do your own thing and...Just enjoy !<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing...<br/>

<br/>
Graham, <br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure that this is an accurate description of letterboxing in <br/>
the US. There are still far too few of us to have a good sense <br/>
whether there is a predominant inclination. Within the several dozen <br/>
people who are placing stamps, we know there are some (such as Mitch <br/>
and Susan, among others) who are very much drawn to stamp artistry. <br/>
There are some (such as Randy and I) who profess to have little <br/>
ability or interest in stamp carving. But we are all, I think, <br/>
interested in clue making, clue solving, and tramping around <br/>
outdoors. <br/>
<br/>
If this latter characterization is what you mean by "gung-ho," then I <br/>
would say that we are not really different: the common denominator is <br/>
a love of hiding and finding boxes. Some of us here happen also to be<br/>
highly motivated by stamp artistry, which is probably true in England <br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
I will admit that I have been held up to some extent from placing <br/>
boxes from a fear that my stamps will be seen as amateurish (or <br/>
worse!), but surely some Brits have the same hang-ups! Anyway, these <br/>
reservations are fading away, as the impulse to get boxes out is too <br/>
strong.<br/>

listed as one that doesn't exist so I wasn't sure if I actually <br/>
posted and I thought I'd better have the right one in the post.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was planning a hike when I came across some information <br/>
about letterboxing and I thought it sounded really interesting. I <br/>
write for the Reading (PA) Eagle/Times in the features department and <br/>
I would love to do a story about letterboxing. I'm looking for <br/>
someone who lives in Berks County or south eastern/central PA who I <br/>
could interview. If you're not interested or not from my area maybe <br/>
you know someone who is. I'm also looking for some background <br/>
information about letterboxing (how and when it got started, how many <br/>
people actively participate, how far reaching it is geographically, <br/>
etc). I would greatly appreciate any input!<br/>

Well I had a day off work and was looking for something to do with my family. I went to the website of our local Park system and there was a link to geocashing, I thought "How hard can that be?" (I don't have a gps unit) I took the co-ordinates and Googled them! That lead me to the park. I never found the geocashing box and I realize I never will without a GPS but I found my first letterbox while looking for it!!!  That was a month ago and since we have planted 3 of our own:)<br/>
