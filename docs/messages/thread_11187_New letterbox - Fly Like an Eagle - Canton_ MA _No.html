Placed by Adelcoll, "Cavy Lovers" and our friend Andy on March 12, <br/>
2003.<br/>
To find the Eagle's Aerie, your must travel the paths at the Mildred <br/>
Morse Allen Wildlife Sanctuary, located at 963 Washing Street, <br/>
Canton, MA (opposite Canton High School). Trail hours are Tuesday <br/>
through Sunday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. If you are not a Massachusetts <br/>
Audubon Member, the admission fee is $4 for adults, $3 for kids (3-<br/>
12) and seniors. If you are interested, there is also an art gallery <br/>
there. For directions and further information, visit the Audubon <br/>
website at <br/>
http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Visual_Arts/<br/>
Kim, Mike and Andy placed "Fly Like and Eagle" on a rare 50-degree <br/>
day in March 2003 with snow still covering the trails. Though <br/>
relatively small as sanctuaries go, Mildred Morse Allen is quiet and <br/>
beautiful. The path we followed is about mile; terrain has small <br/>
hills, but it is an easy hike. Trails are marked by blue and yellow <br/>
dots. As best we could determine, following blue takes you away from <br/>
the parking lot; following yellow takes you back. If you follow a <br/>
loop, as we did, the dots will change over from blue to yellow as you <br/>
loop back.<br/>
