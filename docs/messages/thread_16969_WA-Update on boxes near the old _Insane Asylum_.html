                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well...we did an afternoon of "power" boxing today. Picked up a <br/>
couple of hitchikers along the way too!! I got one and my husband got <br/>
one. <br/>
<br/>
We had prepared and printed out a dozen or so pages of clues so that <br/>
we could make the most of all the available boxes in each area we <br/>
were in. The first round we were to tackle were the ones around the <br/>
old Territorial Insane Asylum. We had figured that there were at <br/>
least four of them in that area.<br/>
<br/>
First one was the "Washington Territorial Asylum Box #1" which <br/>
was "MIA" but only temporarily!! Needless to say it is now back in <br/>
action and it's story will be told further into this post.<br/>
<br/>
Second one was Amanda's Fledgling box! It is alive and well! It is my <br/>
husbands first official stamp in his logbook!! WooHoo..I told him he <br/>
can truly start counting now!!<br/>
<br/>
Third box for finding is Fudrick's Haunted House one. Found it and a <br/>
suprise...actually two suprises! First the "Washington Territorial <br/>
Asylum Box was nestled in next to it! Second the Haunted House was <br/>
flooded!!  We dried it out, swapped out soaking wet ziplocks with dry <br/>
ones and placed a new, dry logbook in it. We have the soaking wet one <br/>
here at home to dry out. The last stamp was done in this logbook on <br/>
November 9th. Hubby says the box wasn't sealed all the way. The <br/>
logbook was not in the plastic bag either (only the stamp was) when <br/>
he opened the box. The letterboxing info sheet was mildewed and ink <br/>
had ran everywhere. We took it out and tossed it into the garbage. <br/>
Didn't have any extras to leave with the box though. We rehid the box <br/>
and will either send the logbook on to Fudrick or can place it back <br/>
in its box next month.<br/>
<br/>
The Insane Asylum letterbox was in great condition and the last log <br/>
in it was last weekend by a geocacher that had come across it looking <br/>
for a cache. I'm assuming that he placed both boxes together and <br/>
didn't log into the other one either because it was soaking wet or he <br/>
was lazy. We replaced the box in its correct spot and hopefully the <br/>
next person will find it. The husband placed it good and made sure <br/>
that it is hidden in its proper hideyhole.<br/>
<br/>
Picked up a hitchhiker "MMII" at "Cheif Leschi Gallows". I like <br/>
Adventure Seekers idea of the VHS Boxes with "double bagging" and <br/>
they marked each bag with it's contents! Made for easy replacement <br/>
and you don't have to worry about waterlogging! Great idea!!<br/>
<br/>
Couldn't find Aunt Beth anywhere. Followed the clues found the only <br/>
orange pipe...and a "stump" but nothing was in the "stump". Lots of <br/>
hay was spread everywhere on the hillside to prevent erosion. We even <br/>
rooted aroud the base of the "stump" to see if it had been moved but <br/>
just found lots of brambles, mud and hay.<br/>
<br/>
Last box was the "Keche" found it pretty easy. Great condition and <br/>
picked up another hitchhiker "Bounding Doe". Keche seemed to be a tad <br/>
bit lonely and hasn't been visited much which is wierd for such a <br/>
simple letterbox to find. <br/>
<br/>
That's Sundays Powerboxing in a nutshell! Now ...about those <br/>
hitchikers...hmm...maybe they are already gone....who knows! WE won't <br/>
tell!<br/>
<br/>
Great Park to letterbox in...we saw that Silver Eagle had even been <br/>
there during his trip here! Lots of dogs and dogs are welcome...just <br/>
remember to have them on leash! Our dogs had a blast especially on <br/>
the trails! <br/>

Thanks for the update on the letterboxes!  Also, thanks for <br/>
returning it to its intended hiding spot.<br/>
<br/>
Well, this one lasted all of what...14 days!  I'm about to give <br/>
up!!!  I will get back to the park and hide it in a TOTALLY <br/>
DIFFERENT spot now as soon as I can because it won't last if they're <br/>
still finding it in its new hiding spot.  What I've been told is <br/>
that the gc in this location is missing/has been for a while--even <br/>
indicated as such on their message board--why are folks still <br/>
looking for it???  Anyway, glad you enjoyed your outing!  Hopefully, <br/>
you learned some history of the area in the process, too.  I'll get <br/>
back there and 'adjust' this letterbox ASAP.  I'm tired of them <br/>
disappearing.  I'll even try to check on Dear Aunt Beth for Fudrick <br/>
and verify that it's missing.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the fact that he/they hid both of these boxes together is <br/>
indicative of how far a gc roams to find their cache!  Lesson <br/>
learned for future placements--hide your letterbox beyond a 100 <br/>
meter radius of the local cache...it might lengthen the lifespan of <br/>
your letterbox.<br/>
