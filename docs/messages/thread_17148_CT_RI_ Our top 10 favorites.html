Now, In keeping with the recent posts, here's our somewhat brief <br/>
list. Keep in mind we're only at about PFX 415ish, so we've not been <br/>
around the block! Heck, we've not even been to Massachusetts!  <br/>
<br/>
1) Jay's Dilemma (for finally solving it)<br/>
2) Happiness at Hartman (the stamp, the scenery)<br/>
3) The Books (for solving it...)<br/>
4) Too Be Precise... and Dragon in The Rock (the view is incredible)<br/>
5) Red Dragon (our first, always a treasure)<br/>
6) Hurricane (our favorite planted box)<br/>
7) Tiptoe Through Tulips (what a fine carving!)<br/>
8) Elephant Safari Series (what a day!!!!) <br/>
9) Inn of the Beginning (probably closer to the top but we did not <br/>
want to seem like Drew-addicts -- even though we are!) <br/>
10) Friends (at WFLT - Avery Tract)(very meaningful!) <br/>
10) (tie) Zoe Zebra -- What an incredible logbook! <br/>
<br/>
General Disclaimer:  This list changes almost daily, and positions <br/>
are altered by season -- ex: Hartman Park and Long Pond Preserve (Too <br/>
Be Precise) are easily the 2 best hikes for fall foliage in southern <br/>
New England. <br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer #2: Just because your box is not here does not mean we <br/>
didn't like it. There's only been 1 hike so far we did not treasure, <br/>
and that was because it was raining and the mosquitoes were making us <br/>
pin cushions! <br/>
