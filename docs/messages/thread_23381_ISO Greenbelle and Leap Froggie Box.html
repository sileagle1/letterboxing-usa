<br/>
Sorry to bother everyone, but does anyone know a letterboxer <br/>
named "Greenbelle"?  She planted a box called "The Leap Froggie Box" <br/>
in Cedar Park, Texas and the clue link just goes back to the LbNA home <br/>
page.  Furthermore, I can't find a way to contact the placer to let <br/>
her/him(?) know about the link problem 'cause I can't get to the clues <br/>
page!?!  Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Batty B of the BusyBeesFamily<br/>

Betty,<br/>
<br/>
Here is the clue:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The  Leap Froggie Box <br/>
The  leap froggie box is in the Buttercup Cave Preserve. The entrance to the <br/>
hiking  trail is on Buttercup Creek Road, almost at the corner of Buttercup <br/>
Creek &amp;  Lakeline Blvd.  <br/>
1.)Enter the trail from the Buttercup Creek entrance.   <br/>
2.)Enter the trail &amp; follow the path into the park   <br/>
3.)On your right you will pass a flat rock area with lots  of sticks and <br/>
cactus.  <br/>
4.)When the path bears to the right continue along it.   <br/>
5.)Continue over large flat rock, bearing to the right.   <br/>
6.)You will pass an "altar" of stacked rocks on your  right, with a stick in <br/>
the center of them pointing upwards.   <br/>
7.)Continue on the path, bearing to the left.   <br/>
8.)Follow the path over more flat rocks.   <br/>
9.)Continue along the path, there will be trees on either  side of you.  <br/>
10.)On your right, directly in front of the 3rd tree,  there will be 3 flat <br/>
rocks with more rocks stacked on top.   <br/>
There is a skinny stick coming out of the middle of the  stacked rocks.  <br/>
11.)The letterbox is under those rocks in a little  crevice.  <br/>
Please put it back the way you found it.   <br/>
NOTE: If you pass the tree with a sign that reads "Cedar  Elm Cave" you have <br/>
gone too far.  <br/>
!!!Good Luck!!!<br/>

I've also used the "contact the placer" function to send an email. I'll let  <br/>
you know if I hear from her.<br/>

My boys, a friend, her daughter and I went on our first letterboxing <br/>
adventure today and we found a box of Greenbelle's.  It had been <br/>
opened and scattered.  Don't know that we found all of it, but I think <br/>
enough of it.  The lid had a note with Greenbelle's phone number.  <br/>
Considering we weren't even looking for that one but found it.  It had <br/>
a fish stamp in it, so I don't think it was Leap Froggie Box.  Here is <br/>
her phone number:  <br/>

It was a fun adventure and most of the group want to do it again.<br/>
