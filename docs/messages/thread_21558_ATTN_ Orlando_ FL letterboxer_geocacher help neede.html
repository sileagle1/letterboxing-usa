OK, I know there's a certain amount of rivalry between letterboxing <br/>
and geocaching, but bear with me, as there's also a lot of <br/>
crossover. Hopefully, we can find someone who does both in the <br/>
Florida area.<br/>
<br/>
A geocacher was out in the Disneyworld area geocaching and <br/>
accidentally found a letterbox. Not realizing it wasn't the geocache <br/>
he was looking for, he left a travel bug in the cache. Travel bugs <br/>
are like LB hitchhikers, except instead of being a stamp and book, <br/>
it's a tag with a serial number that you log at the geocaching <br/>
website.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, his attempt to email the LB owner bounced, and <br/>
there's no guarantee the LB owner would be able to get out there <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I offered to post here looking for someone who letterboxes and <br/>
geocaches in the area and who would be willing to pick up the bug <br/>
and move it to a geocache (any geocache will do) and log it on the <br/>
geocaching.com website.<br/>
<br/>
So, is anyone willing and able to do that?<br/>

<br/>
Letterbug, assuming the travelbug isn't very big, I found a <br/>
Letterbox hybrid on www.geocaching.com for you to put the bug in. I <br/>
can help you record it, if you want me to.  The letterbox hybrid is <br/>
in winter haven, fl and called Azalea, It is located on <br/>
letterboxing.org,<br/>
<br/>
Stephanie, you may also want to contact summerkitchen, who appears <br/>
to be a geocacher/letterboxer.  Does the geocacher have any idea of <br/>
where is was, Even he could give us coordinates, it will limit the <br/>
area of the search.<br/>

Unfortunately, he sent me the name of the letterbox by email and my<br/>
email service provider shut down my account yesterday (it's a<br/>
misunderstanding and will be back online today).<br/>
<br/>
I remember the box was called "Celebrate" and it was part of a series<br/>
in Disneyworld, but I don't have the name of the series, nor the<br/>
website, and when I searched on AtlasQuest I didn't find it.<br/>

I located another hybrid letterbox called Rock springs #2 by <br/>

the box is near apoka, fl if you are interested.<br/>

Sounds like the one in Celebration.   It's part of the "Disney Series."   And <br/>
there is a geocache VERY close to the box.   I've found both.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I'm way down in Fort Lauderdale, and won't be getting up to <br/>
Orlando anytime too soon.<br/>
