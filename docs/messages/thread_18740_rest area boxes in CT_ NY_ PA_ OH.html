                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone! I was wondering if I could get some help in finding out if there are any rest area boxes along I84 in CT, NY and PA, I80 in PA and OH, and I90 in NY, PA and OH. I am also interested in knowing if there are any boxes in Sandusky, OH or in the Niagra Falls area. We are doing some traveling over the summer and I would love to find some boxes out of CT. The only box I found along I84 in a rest area is in Southington called The I-84 R.S. box. I could not find any others in rest areas or in Sandusky or Niagra Falls. I'm hoping someone might know of some. Thanks for all your help.<br/>
