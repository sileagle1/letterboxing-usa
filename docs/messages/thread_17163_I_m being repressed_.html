One will be moderated if they:<br/>

I think you have misunderstood a statement that I made and I feel the <br/>
need to clarify it for you and the rest of the group to make sure <br/>
that it doesn't get taken the way you read it.<br/>
<br/>
I am not saying nor implying that your feelings do not matter.  I <br/>
think everyone's feelings matter.  But first of all you are <br/>
responsible for your feelings not anyone else. You choose whether you <br/>
feel something or not.<br/>
<br/>
What I said was "And not to sound callous but frankly, it doesn't <br/>
matter that it didn't bother you." This is not to imply that your <br/>
feelings do not matter, but instead that if it did not bother you to <br/>
see what was going on, and it did bother 100 other people, those 100 <br/>
other people who are bothered by what they saw, that it does trouble, <br/>
they deserve just as must recognition of their feelings as anyone <br/>
else.  Whether we like to admit it or not we live in a society where <br/>
majority rules, and in this case the 100s of people that were <br/>
disturbed by it, vs. the few that saw no problem with the constant <br/>
arguing and berating that was going on here called for action and <br/>
received it. <br/>
<br/>
Again I am not attempting to sound callous but I would rather have 1 <br/>
or 10 people leave because they were too paranoid about being <br/>
moderated (which to me is silly, I mean you won't be moderated as <br/>
long as you don't personally attack or flame someone, so why not just <br/>
be nice and not get moderated?) Than to see 100's of people leaving <br/>
the list because of what was going on.  <br/>
<br/>
Your feelings definitely matter or I would not take the time to <br/>
respond to them, just when weighted against the feelings of the rest <br/>
of the group, our actions remain the same. <br/>
<br/>
I bid you well,<br/>

<br/>
I know you are having an open discussion directed to Poison Ivy's comments and concerns, but I was just wondering about that number of people who you claim have complained about posts on the list.  Personal responsibility to filter for themselves aside, if 100 people (or maybe "100s"; I'm not really clear on how many people have complained to moderators) out of roughly 1454 seem upset, then that is a paltry number.  That leaves 1354 who either filter, delete, shrug off the banter, don't bother to read the posts, or just don't seem to care.  I'm a little confused about how you've concluded that 100 or so people are the majority that should rule, and why the moderators would react to please the minority. <br/>
<br/>
This all seems to me like much ado about nothing.  I've read a few comments here and there about some posts being flames, but I have yet to see a good (or bad) flame war here.  I have seen few things I would even categorize as "flames" here.  I think of flames as really caustic, insulting, inflamatory, degrading, irrate, hostile, etc. (but often quite clever and darkly amusing), remarks generally aimed at other posters to make them feel incredibly stupid or inferior, and lacking knowledge on a subject.  Maybe some of those 100 complainants should seek out some groups known for flames and see what a real flame war is like.  But maybe I am just hardened.  It's not that I advocate a flame war or hostile atmosphere here, but I don't think there is one.  Disagreement and heated discussion do not constitute a flame war.  Yes, I appreciate the good people for their kindness and gentility.  But I get really uncomfortable with censorship, too, to appease those whose comfort zone has been a little compromised.  I'm all for monitoring and deleting porn and very vulgar posts, but my standards of what's acceptible discussion may not be anything like yours.  I think that the laissez-faire approach *does* work fine most of the time and for most of us.  I could be wrong, but I really don't see what all the fuss has been about.  I like it when we are free to speak and disagree.  If being for that makes me a 1 in 10, my view may be skewed.  I certainly wouldn't just stop reading and posting because you *might* moderate my opinions or the way I express them right into oblivion.  I just have this real uneasy feeling that the majority of whom you profess to protect the interests is just a vocal (and whiny) minority. JMNSHO.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good Day Mary,<br/>
<br/>
First of all Mary let me start by saying that I did not decide to <br/>
moderate the list, the Owner did I am merely one of the moderators <br/>
who agree with his actions.  Because you have directed your questions <br/>
to me I am going to respond, but since I have said the same thing <br/>
repeatedly I am going to keep this rather short.<br/>
<br/>
1.	You are not being "censored" <br/>
2.	You are not being "moderated"<br/>
3.	You will only be moderated if you post something that is <br/>
considered a flame/personal attack, or to my understanding beat a <br/>
dead horse.  So lets say for example we have a topic up for debate <br/>
that has gotten to heated and the comments are turning into personal <br/>
attacks. The recent database argument for example.  If a moderator <br/>
declares the topic closed, then the list will be expected to not <br/>
continue to instigate arguments by insisting on debating the topic. <br/>
4.	Nothing has changes in regards to the privilege of the <br/>
moderators we always had all the abilities to make it so your posts <br/>
had to be approved first, to silence you, or to remove you from the <br/>
list.  Randy's (The list Owner's) approach was a kinder gentler <br/>
laissez-faire approach.  It did not work.  Too many people <br/>
complained and frankly Mary you may not think that receiving 25 <br/>
emails a day from different people represents the majority of the <br/>
list  but I'm a businesswoman. If I get 25 complaints from my <br/>
customers about an employee in a day, she is going to be talked to <br/>
and something is going to be done about it.  I don't care if 1500 <br/>
people were happy with her, the 25 she offended is unacceptable and <br/>
in my opinion such is the case here as well. <br/>
5.	My personal opinion, since you have offered yours, is if you <br/>
or anyone else for that matter is upset with the fact that moderators <br/>
are actually moderating and that we will not tolerate instigating, <br/>
flaming and insulting remarks then perhaps this board is no longer <br/>
the place for you.  I don't mean that to sound callous but my stance <br/>
on Randy's decision and the moderator's positions in the last few <br/>
days will not change bottom line, this is the way the Owner and <br/>
moderators are going to be doing things for a while. If this is not <br/>
acceptable to you then you personally have several choices you can <br/>
make.  Those choices are all completely up to you, but debating and <br/>
continuing a discussion on it is moot issue at this point.<br/>
6.	I think if you take a look at the types of posts that I have <br/>
interceded in since I have been a moderator you will see that the <br/>
sort of thing I find unacceptable is pretty blatantly insulting to <br/>
someone. <br/>
7.	I believe the same to be true of the other moderators as well.<br/>
8.	I am tired of listening to the complaints about being <br/>
moderated and being "censored" honestly  stop complaining about <br/>
something that hasn't happened, the day you are moderated or censored <br/>
you can start screaming about it.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; people have complained to moderators) out of roughly 1454 seem<br/>
&gt; upset, then that is a paltry number.<br/>
<br/>
Just counting those people that vocally complain about a certain <br/>
issue isn't going to give an accurate count about what percentage of <br/>
the sample population feels that way.  Any good business owner knows <br/>
that for every person that does complain, there's as many as a dozen <br/>
that feel the same way but say or do nothing to correct it.  They'll <br/>
just go somewhere else eventually.<br/>
<br/>
There clearly aren't 1454 people posting to this board on a regular <br/>
basis.  (Heaven forbid if they do!  That's a lot of posts to wade <br/>
through if every member posts just once per day!)  A lot of those <br/>
people might not even follow the board and are a member in name <br/>
only.  There's more than one talk list that I'm a member of that I <br/>
haven't visited for months.  So it's probably an artificially high <br/>
number to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the population on this board would be skewed towards <br/>
those that do enjoy conflicts since those that don't are more likely <br/>
to pick up and leave.  So even if the majority of people on this <br/>
board are okay with no moderating at all, the letterboxing population <br/>
as a whole might not be--which is pricisely who the talk list is for: <br/>
All letterboxers.  Not just those that enjoy the conflict.<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, now that the boards are "moderated", it's likely to drive <br/>
off those that don't like moderation of any sort.  Over time, it'll <br/>
likely stack the talk list with lots of people who prefer the <br/>
moderating.  There's not really a solution that will make EVERYONE <br/>
happy--at least I haven't thought of any and neither has anyone else--<br/>
but the owner and moderators of this board are trying to make the <br/>
talk list appeal to the masses as a whole in the fairest way possible <br/>
with the least amount of moderation possible.  And as the instigator <br/>
of more than one "heated discussion", I applaud their efforts.  If  a <br/>
post of mine is deleted for the sake of making this board a bit <br/>
better, well, I'll get over it.  =)<br/>

this  board are okay with no moderating at all, the letterboxing <br/>
population as a whole might not be--which is pricisely who the talk <br/>
list is for: All letterboxers.  Not just those that enjoy the <br/>
conflict.<br/>

&gt; Ironically, now that the boards are "moderated", it's likely to <br/>
drive off those that don't like moderation of any sort.  Over time, <br/>
it'll likely stack the talk list with lots of people who prefer the  <br/>
moderating.  There's not really a solution that will make EVERYONE  <br/>
happy--at least I haven't thought of any and neither has anyone else--<br/>

possible <br/>

instigator <br/>

It is not a matter of naivety Psychomommy it is a simple solution to <br/>
see how many "members" are on this list. When you go to the actual <br/>

becomes blatantly clear how many people are subscribed to this list <br/>
in one form or another. It clearly says on the right hand side <br/>

So is it truly being nave to think that there are that many members? <br/>
Hardly the case, what it actually is; is using some basic computer <br/>
skills and logic. Ryan wrote to the board based on the facts given to <br/>
him, he read what has been provided to him, thought on it and made a <br/>
determination based on the information read, perhaps some can follow <br/>

&gt; Me too! Can we please declare this a dead subject &amp; move on since the <br/>
&gt; moderators position is not going to change? <br/>
<br/>
We can, and do.  I'll personally ban the next person who posts on the<br/>
subject.  I'm fed up with playing kindergarten cop around here, and<br/>
asking the volunteer moderators to waste time on what should be a<br/>
non-issue.  Grow up people.  Moderation only applies to those who wish <br/>
to be uncivil.  If that applies to you, you have no rights, except to<br/>
get lost.  Goodby.<br/>
<br/>
The feedback I'm getting is that people want moderation to work.  They<br/>
want the list to be a fun place to play letterboxing.  When pests come <br/>
into a society, most members of that society are willing to temporarily <br/>
suspends freedoms until the pests are dealt with.  Once the pests are<br/>
vanquished, things return to the way they were.  Remember, I ahhor moderation<br/>
as much as the next person, and resent the pests who have forced it on<br/>
the list. <br/>
<br/>
Concerns about moderation should be sent to me directly.  Not the list, <br/>
not the moderators.  They are all burnt out on it.  I'll ban anyone who <br/>
violates this rule.<br/>
<br/>
The subject is off topic.  Call it martial law if you want.  Either<br/>
the pests will be silent, or be gone.<br/>

I had no idea that this list was being moderated, I don't check in <br/>
often enough I guess. <br/>
<br/>
This is indeed, as someone said earlier, much ado about nothing and <br/>
yet a glimpse of the flaws and blessings of human nature. I have <br/>
seen similar degeneration in other e-mail groups. It is a testament <br/>
to the truism that absolute power corrupts absolutely. The "owners" <br/>
of some forum decide that things have become unmanageable and, <br/>
because they can, begin editing, deleting or otherwise screening <br/>
what is allowed on "their site" inevitably leading to new splinter <br/>
groups and subgroups etc. It is no different in any group, society <br/>
or nation, i.e. "When in the course of human events..." <br/>
<br/>
I am always amazed at how willing people are to rush to the "aid" of <br/>
the authority figure there by gaining their own position of <br/>
authority. This will to power often seems to overtake objective <br/>
reason and you are left with a corrupt system of cronyism and <br/>
favoritism. (What a unique and blessed quirk it was that the <br/>
founding fathers either thought themselves fallible or were <br/>
supremely confident in their philosophy that they were enlightened <br/>
enough to ensure the right of the masses to free expression of <br/>
ideas.)<br/>
<br/>
It is astounding to me even given this apparent flaw of human nature <br/>
that this dynamic applies even on such a microscopic level as this <br/>
group, and that a group of what I assume are adults can't maintain a <br/>
level of civility in their interactions as to continue to peruse the <br/>
common interest that was the impetus for the group. But I must <br/>
remind myself that the computer age has allowed us to act in an <br/>
uncivil manner with out fear of tarnishing ones reputation. All the <br/>
interaction that occurs in this type of forum is in the minds eye, <br/>
there is no face-to-face interaction that seems to provide a check <br/>
on uncivil and ill-mannered behavior. One can easily act rudely and <br/>
then click off their computer as well as any consequences of their <br/>
behavior. What is it about looking someone in the eye that tempers <br/>
human behavior, and what is it about the human condition that leads <br/>
to such a lust for power? How odd that these 2 opposing forces are <br/>
so strong in the human animal. <br/>
<br/>
When any more than a few of us come together there is an inevitable <br/>
struggle for domination over the others, but then we must face the <br/>
contradiction inherent in that situation. We lust for power over the <br/>
very people we need for that power to mean anything.  <br/>
<br/>
We know that we can accomplish great things by working together and <br/>
build great societies but we still lust for absolute power over all <br/>
that that cooperation has built. Empathy is the uniquely human <br/>
characteristic that allows us to realize the benefit of cooperation <br/>
and it is the lower animal instinct to dominate that we must temper <br/>
with empathy. This legacy of our animalistic past is the opposing <br/>
force that prevents us from seeing the benefits of cooperation. It <br/>
is empathy that grants us that window through which we can see that <br/>
by helping others we help ourselves and that none will benefit from <br/>
dominating the rest. It is in all our best interests to cooperate <br/>
and work together toward the same purpose but alas let to our own <br/>
devices, time and again, we succumb to the lust for power.<br/>

&gt; 1.	You are not being "censored" <br/>
&gt; 2.	You are not being "moderated"<br/>
<br/>
you forgot one thing<br/>
<br/>
nobody cares how clever everyone else is quoting<br/>
movies, and having their little fight for<br/>
independence.<br/>
<br/>
we're very new to this list, but some of the members<br/>
are making a foul taste in my mouth.<br/>
<br/>
though it's nice to see all the self-proclaimed email<br/>
martyrs out there unsubbing in an ostentatious<br/>
fireball of glory<br/>
<br/>
good.... less weak links.<br/>
<br/>
does anyone even letterbox here, or do they just like<br/>
to start fights? god.<br/>
