to remove it but the clues are the second in a list of three so it will be a <br/>
little more involved than simply deleting it.  It is listed under Mansfield <br/>
Depot Letterboxes and it is the Depot Letterbox, the second of the set.  I <br/>
can't imagine how backed up the webmasters are right now, just the volume of <br/>
e-mail from this list practically fills my mailbox every day!<br/>
<br/>
Someone did have difficulty finding Great Grape Trail (the third of the set) <br/>
but someone else reported finding it recently so I'm assuming it's still out <br/>
there.  Sorry that you went on a wild goose chase!<br/>

&gt;We couldn't find this one today and noticed at a different box in the same <br/>
&gt;town someone stated that they couldn't find it either. Does anyone know the <br/>
&gt;status of this box?<br/>
