Grove, Pike Co., Ohio. Difficulty: Easy.  This letterbox is inspired <br/>
by one of autumn's prettiest trees. The Gingko's fan-shaped leaves <br/>
turn a brilliant yellow in the fall. However, the female Gingko <br/>
produces a small fruit which emits one of the nastiest odors in the <br/>
natural world. As with many things in life, sometimes you "just have <br/>
to take the bitter with the better".    CLUES: Go to the rest area <br/>
on Route 32 near Elm Grove. Start at the " Windhover" sculpture near <br/>
the restrooms building. Standing four feet to the south of the <br/>
sculpture, take a compass reading of 184 degrees.  Go 34 paces at <br/>
this heading to a metal object. Then go 16 paces @ 165 degrees to a <br/>
tree against a fence. The box is hidden under a rock and some bark <br/>
where the tree has grown into the fencing.<br/>
