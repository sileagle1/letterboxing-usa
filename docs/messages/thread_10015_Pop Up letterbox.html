                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here is a thought on a snowed in afternoon. How about letterboxes <br/>
that have a trip wire or electronic beam that pops up  a flag like <br/>
and ice fishing rig. It will be the only way to find anything today <br/>
the snow is coming down so hard. As we loaded the school buses for <br/>
todays early dismissal  a parent said we had 1 inch in twenty <br/>
minutes. that would explain the 30 minutes drive to make it home  <br/>
when most days its 10 minutes. Anyway stuck here now so will do <br/>
chores in the barn, make stew and bread and carve a stamp all the <br/>
Christmas plasticware to fill! Keep dry folks  Leader of the pack -<br/>

                    <html><body>oh you're not kidding!  I taught in Enfield today, where we had an early dismissal, but the roads were great.  Who would have thought that just five miles down Route 91, it was a wall of snow!  It took me over an hour to get home, and I was hoping to go out letterboxing tomorrow.... well.... we'll see.....
