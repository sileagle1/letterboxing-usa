                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have decided to put the stamp to use that I carved for the <br/>
apparently bogus Smithsonian contest. I just finished a nice log book <br/>
for it and will send it to any event that wants it. <br/>
<br/>
The image of the stamp is in the files section of the talk list <br/>
website. I worked too hard on it to put it out in the woods as <br/>
critter food and I hate to see it just sitting here collecting dust. <br/>
So I decided that the largest number of people could enjoy it by <br/>
making it a travelling event stamp. Since there are very few events <br/>
I'm able to attend, at least I can be there in spirit through this <br/>
stamp. <br/>

P.S. to Ryan... Iunderstand your wish for your event stamp count to <br/>
match the number of events you've attended, but why avoid the "extra" <br/>
stamps? Why not stamp them, enjoy them, but not count them? Just <br/>
wondering. <br/>

Actually, that is probably what I'd do.  But at the last event I went <br/>
to, it seemed like there were half a dozen traveling event stamps, <br/>
which seemed kind of redundant redundant, so I stopped stamping into <br/>
them.  They don't get me excited anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I've never actually been at an event where there was more than <br/>
one "official" event stamp, so I haven't had to make that decision.  <br/>
If somehow an event ended up with two "official" event stamps, I'd <br/>
still take them both.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the thing about the traveling event stamps, though: EVERYONE <br/>
gets copies of them.  I like the thrill of having a "rare" stamp, but <br/>
traveling event stamps are not them.  Eventually, every letterboxer <br/>
across the country gets the stamp.  And it's not even special in the <br/>
sense that it commemorates that, specific event.  There isn't any <br/>
particularly neat clue to go with it.  It's so generic.<br/>
<br/>
The first one I saw I thought was a neat, unique idea.  But now?  <br/>
Blah.  Not my thing.  Which is fine--some people like traveling event <br/>
stamps, but they no longer interest me so I've stopped signing into <br/>
them.<br/>

<br/>
Right.  Weirdly, I think that's part of what I actually like about <br/>
them.  They are some of the only images that might be shared by <br/>
letterboxers who confine their letterboxing activities to a <br/>
particular region of the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
Where else, for instance, would someone in California who rarely has <br/>
an opportunity to travel much get an impression of a Leger de Maine <br/>
stamp? (O.k., in Montecito, but besides that...)<br/>
<br/>
I like a rare stamp too- but I like these traveling event stamps <br/>
because of the history they build and the fact that they create <br/>
common ground for boxers who might otherwise have none.<br/>

Now why would you want an impression of a Legerdemaine stamp?  ;o)<br/>
