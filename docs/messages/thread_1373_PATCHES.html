bit shocked at first at the concept of being able to buy merit badges without <br/>
providing proof of your accomplishments, but I see no other way around it.  <br/>
As Randy and others point out, our group is not adequately organized to <br/>
handle the processing of such an endeavor.<br/>
<br/>
The Valley Quest series might actually be seen as the first significant CHAIN <br/>
of letterboxes in this country. The rigorous requirements for obtaining the <br/>
commemorative badge for this chain might serve as a model for future badges <br/>
that may become available for other chains.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a patch will someday be available for collecting a stamp from every <br/>
state, or for completing the Appalachian Trail.  Prolific letterbox creators <br/>
might even someday offer badges to those who supply proof that they've <br/>
collected a certain number of that particular individual's letterbox stamps. <br/>
The proof required for these sorts of badges will likely be much greater than <br/>
for the more general patches we are looking at having made at this time.<br/>
<br/>
The most I would consider asking people to provide right now is a simple list <br/>
of the letterboxes they have found or placed to qualify, just for <br/>
documentation purposes, although even this might be pointless.<br/>
<br/>
Another consideration we should not forget, however, is that the cost of <br/>
producing numbered patches is going to be significantly higher than the cost <br/>
of , because of the reduced demand.  Also, the price of producing patches for <br/>
collecting 100 boxes will seem prohibitive compared to the price of the <br/>
25-box patch, because more people are going to qualify for the 25-box patch.<br/>
<br/>
When we get ready to order these patches, we should be prepared to <br/>
manufacture the full set, so that even if only a few people qualify for the <br/>
100 (or 500?) box patch, they will be able to purchase them right away.  The <br/>
price of all the numbered merit badges should be notably higher than the <br/>
price of the LbNA patch, so that purchases of the 25-box patch will help <br/>
cover the cost of producing the 100-box patch. The higher price may also help <br/>
discourage trivial purchases by people who do not really qualify for the <br/>
patch.<br/>

Mitch, I think this is a good idea. I know people who collect patches <br/>
for the sake of collecting them, as was mentioned on this board <br/>
previously. If the merit badges are more costly than the plain LbNA <br/>
patch, it should dissuade casual patch collectors.<br/>
<br/>
Until Michigan gets its act in gear (I've written to the Outdoor <br/>
columnist for the Detroit Free Press to suggest an artcle), I'll have <br/>
to do with only a handful of patches and won't qualify for a merit <br/>
patch for some time ----- until next June when I am going to <br/>
Connecticut, Letterboxing Heaven, where I am going to snag as many as <br/>
possible in a short period of time!<br/>

I've wondered why Connecticut has become as you say, letterboxing <br/>
heaven. It took about 4 times looking at that map for me to realize <br/>
just how many there were here as compared to the other states. And <br/>
it's basically just southeastern Connecticut. We're talking about an <br/>
area of about 60 square miles. Why exactly has it worked that way? <br/>
Anyone have any clues or insight? I mean other than the drewclan <br/>
factor of course :-)<br/>

<br/>
(sorry in advance for this huge mailing..I've sent the jpg's on three<br/>
different emails to reduce the size ...)<br/>
<br/>
As a mere Dartmoor letterboxer you might like to "see" how we cope with<br/>
the same patch problems in England..<br/>
<br/>
The 100 Club is our letterboxing equivalent (though not on email) of<br/>
LbNA..and the theory is that to "join" you must first find 100 letterboxes<br/>
"without clues !!!"<br/>
<br/>
OK it's a bit easier because we've got em all in one place and a lot more<br/>
of em...<br/>
<br/>
But to "Join"you send in your database list of 100...to the "club"..and we<br/>
believe you "<br/>
<br/>
(Why bother cheating..it's only you you're foolin' <grin>)<br/>
<br/>
You can "then" buy the first 100 Club patch and only then the book of<br/>
clues !<br/>
<br/>
We dont put em on email .. to try and defeat box-bandits !<br/>
<br/>
For each of the next patches the club keeps a card index (yes for real a<br/>
card box full of names and addresses) and if you're on a card then you can<br/>
buy the next patch in sequence...<br/>
<br/>
(See how much easier it is on your side of the pond <grin>)<br/>
<br/>
All our patches (well almost all) are almost the same !  eh ? I hear you<br/>
say ..well do look at my fist pic...(Lady Facing Right) <br/>
<br/>
She has three 100 Club patches .. for 100, 200 and 300..(by colur code)<br/>
<br/>
The top one ?<br/>
<br/>
Well ..see below !! <grin><br/>
<br/>
Does she strike you as a keen letterboxer ?<br/>
<br/>
Well her other arm tells it all !<br/>
<br/>
Check out Lady Facing Left ! <grin><br/>
<br/>
Yes that does say 1000 and 2000 Letterboxes (Phew!)<br/>
<br/>
Now those green top patches are "very special"<br/>
<br/>
The one on the left arm .. can you read it ?<br/>
<br/>
It is "Cranmere Pool" ..and that is the First Ever Letterbox .. so its<br/>
quite an achievement and we have a special patch for that...<br/>
<br/>
Dartmoor is in two halves with a road East West across the<br/>
middle...Cranmere Pool is on the North Moor and a similar "key" letterbox<br/>
is "Ducks Pool" on the South moor...That is the patch on the first jpg...<br/>
<br/>
We also make specials for arranged events and other "special" boxes..<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine "Prayer Rock" which I believe was US box 1 could be a<br/>
special patch...Then as you say special state patches..or a "meet" patch<br/>
(very rare)<br/>
<br/>
OK that's all in the future..<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally we dont have a P index at all ... or an X (Whatever that was?)<br/>
<br/>
But we have had a few specials...<br/>
<br/>
The last jpg's are only for those who are not faint of heart <grin><br/>
<br/>
Here are a few characters at the Dartmoor Meet <br/>
<br/>
(FYI it is held at the Dartmoor Prison Officers Club  .. Dartmoor Prison<br/>
was Britains most remote prison in the 50's ..)<br/>
<br/>
Yep we are eccentric...but just check out a few of the "inmates" they are<br/>
even more eccentric imho <lol><br/>
<br/>
Do check out their patches...photgraphed at The Meet !<br/>
<br/>
Warning Patches can get serious !<br/>
<br/>
The beer man has a 5000 patch and you can make out two different (year)<br/>
Ten Post Box walk patches and other "specials"<br/>
<br/>
And as you can see the group bring in their own personal stamps, and show<br/>
off their collection ...Notice the guy in the middle has his personal<br/>
stamp knitted up on his Jersey, (sweatshirt) isn't that the ultimate patch<br/>
!<br/>
<br/>
Don't they all look happy though<br/>
(Such cheerful souls letterboxers,  bless em ! <g>)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and...................<br/>

I just thought I'd show the 100 Club patches..I do hope that it wasn't too<br/>

There's plenty of time for other patches to say Letterboxer or<br/>
Letterboxing.. especalliy for those walks or trails as you call em .. or<br/>
series stamps or even one offs..State stamps sound just<br/>
amazing...Collecting all 50 ..wow !..<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Looks like <br/>
&gt;we're well on our way with the patches ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Yep it certainly looks like a great start...I am envious of how its<br/>
growing on your side of the pond... One day a large figure in purple<br/>
walking gear (Wizard robes ! <g>) may stroll into a LbNA meet.. One day<br/>
...<g><br/>
<br/>
F45 is very good considering the distances needed to get this hi score.. <br/>
You deserve a patch for that ! imho !  or maybe just 5 more .."he he" ..it<br/>

Not at all.  Actually, if you feel so inclined, perhaps you can share <br/>
with us (to the extent that you can, of course) some of your <br/>
experiences relating to the more "mysterious" or "underground" <br/>
aspects of Dartmoor letterboxing.  Now that I wrote that, I'm <br/>
wondering whether to even send this.  How can you tell us about these <br/>
aspects if they are to be found out about some other way?  Ho, I'll <br/>
ask any way.  My intent is two-fold.  We have many new subs to this <br/>
list who may know very little about the Dartmoor experience, but <br/>
secondly, I'd like to see us develop the less obvious aspects of <br/>
letterboxing a little more on this side of the pond.  Just a thought.<br/>

1) PATCH COUNT:  The present patch and decal poll shows an estimated <br/>
count of 36 patches, but it is actually much *higher* as a few people <br/>
have indicated that they want 3 or 4 patches. Additionally, I have <br/>
gotten a few requests off-list because someone had technical problems <br/>
with the poll. I know at this point we are within a few patches of <br/>
the minimum (50), and I'd be happy to order the last few myself so we <br/>
can have some extras on hand. So, as far as the minimum goes, WE'RE <br/>
THERE! (Remember, we are talking about LbNA logo patches right now, <br/>
NOT P# and F# merit badges. I'll address that in a moment.)<br/>
<br/>
2) With the LbNA gathering on Jan. 28th, I'm sure a number of you <br/>
will be sporting your new patches and decals. I thought I would hold <br/>
off the order for just a couple more weeks in case anyone at the <br/>
gathering saw the patches and wanted to get in on the order.<br/>
<br/>
3) DECALS: We are bound by a minimum of 25 decals. (What a pain in <br/>
the a**). We can probably meet that. The "Poll" feature on this list <br/>
is an invaluable tool in a case like this and I'll set one up to see <br/>
where we stand on commitment to decals at $4.00 each.<br/>
<br/>
4) P#-F# MERIT BADGES: Here's the kicker: we must have a minimum <br/>
order of 50 merit badges - ALL OF THE SAME EXACT TYPE/DENOMINATION. <br/>
There is *alot* of interest in the P/F merit badges as Mohmers' <br/>
recent poll shows, but unfortunately, we are nowhere near 50 of any <br/>
one type. Sorry, folks, but unfortunately those are the stipulations <br/>
that Town Hall Embroidery has imposed on us. (And before you say it, <br/>
yes, I KNOW they are not the only embroidery game in town.)<br/>
<br/>
5) ORDER FORM AND PAYMENT: Don't send me any money just yet!!! You <br/>
will place your order to me by printing out the patch/decal order <br/>
form and enclosing a check and self-addressed, stamped envelope. All <br/>
the info you need to know (tax, postage) is on the form. The form can <br/>
be found by going to the www.letterboxing.org site, click on "New", <br/>
and go to the October archives. There's the form.<br/>
<br/>
6) WEBMASTERS: I have thought of asking you to put the order form in <br/>
a more conspicuous location (easier access, higher visibility) on the <br/>
LbNA site. Not sure if that's a good idea at this point. Until we get <br/>
through the logistical growing pains of patch ordering, I fear that <br/>
newcomers will see the form, send me money and uggghhhh...I have to <br/>
then send it back (and at my own expense). I think that moving the <br/>
order form to a better place is a good idea, but perhaps a premature <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
7) THERE MUST BE AN EASIER WAY: Except I don't know what it is yet. <br/>
Surely the people at Town Hall Embroidery in Illinois (with which Kay <br/>
Mohmers worked to set this up) are reasonable folks....maybe I can <br/>
see if they're willing to come down on the minimums or possibly <br/>
allowed a "mixed" order of P and F patches. I have my doubts, but <br/>
it's worth a try.<br/>
<br/>
8) AVOIDING CATASTROPHE: So now you all know the logistics of patch <br/>
ordering, payment, etc. What I DON'T want to happen is for people to <br/>
send me money for something that can't soon be ordered. That puts me <br/>
in the position of having to me having to send BACK your money. <br/>
(Using a *few* stamps and a *few* of my personal checks for refunds <br/>
is no big deal...BUT: this definitely has the potential to get out of <br/>
hand. Therefore, I would prefer to avoid it happening altogether. The <br/>
only way I can see to do that is by what we're presently doing. Take <br/>
a poll, see where we're at, and proceed from there.<br/>
<br/>
9) THE ANSWER: Is for each individual to order directly from the <br/>
supplier. But our current supplier will have none of that. Uggghhh.<br/>
<br/>
ON A MORE POSITIVE NOTE: I again remind you that a logo patch order <br/>
will go in soon. If you want LOGO PATCHES **ONLY** (no decals), fill <br/>
out the order form and send it to me with your payment. If you want a <br/>
decal too, put your vote in the poll to see if I we can meet the <br/>
minimum to go with the patch order. Just don't send any decal money <br/>
until you get a confirmation that we can order them!!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long-windedness. But at least everybody knows the deal <br/>
now. PLEASE give me any feedback , suggestions, comments on this. I <br/>
welcome them.<br/>

Have a good weekend, boxers!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As for the P and F Merit badges.  Would it be possible to make one patch<br/>
with glue backing and very little stichwork that can be cut up.  This<br/>
patch could contain small sections P10 P25 P50 P100 F10 F25 F50<br/>
F100.  This way each person could use what they need out of it.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen something similar in my Boy Scout Days.  Just little bars<br/>
usually rectangular 1" by 3/8".  Sometime these were curved to fit a round<br/>
patch.<br/>
<br/>
I envision placing a rectangular P at the top of my soon to be ordered<br/>
LbNA patch, and a rectangular F at the bottom. Or some variant there of.<br/>
<br/>
Then if I get into a real craze of letterboxing like Jay, no need to wait<br/>
a long time to get a higher number. Just cut the desired part out<br/>
composite P and F patch...<br/>
<br/>
Obviously in order for this to work, little stickwork is necessary.<br/>
