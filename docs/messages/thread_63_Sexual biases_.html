<br/>
I don't know if the child in the picture at Kids Corner is a boy or a girl.  I<br/>
guessed it was a boy and that's why I originally referred to it as such, but the<br/>
more I look at it I'm not really sure it is.  Anyway, I don't think its<br/>
important.  We probably were going to have one character whether a boy, a girl<br/>
or some other animated character -- to demonstrate a hunt for kids -- it ought<br/>
to make no difference to us one way or the other if we really are unbiased<br/>
people.  But I certainly don't see it as necessary to add another character,<br/>
whether a boy or a girl, in order to convince ourselves that we are being nice<br/>
to everyone.  This is just letterboxing.  We're not the Anti-defamation League. <br/>
I don't think you'll see anything happening here that would raise any of those<br/>
concerns.  I, for one, like everybody who is a decent friend.  You can be orange<br/>
and hobbling on one leg, that's OK with me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I remember when I was a child, I didn't care who was what.  I played<br/>
with everyone just the same -- girls, and boys.  Then I got older and hormones<br/>
have skewed my perceptions ever since.  But I just want to say I think there are<br/>
no sexual biases here.  I like you all: You gals in TEXAS and you guys in<br/>
Oregon.  You're all cool to me.  I'm content to leave it up to Mitch or whoever<br/>
contributes an illustration to choose a sex for the child or the little animal<br/>
person -- whatever it turns out to be -- And hopefully we will never have to<br/>
worry about this PC stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I am a bit disappointed though that we have no girls with web development<br/>
skills.  So far it is just me Mitch and Randy.  It would be nice to have a girl<br/>
or two to help out with what otherwise might be skewed (artistically, not<br/>
sexually) by men.<br/>
<br/>
So again, I just want to say: Let's make the kid's thing helpful and fun and not<br/>
worry about being PC.  But also, girls jump in anytime and make your<br/>
contributions and opinions known.  We're not snobbish or egoistic here.  All<br/>
ideas are welcome.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside: I find it interesting how clear it was in Mitch's memory about all<br/>
the hoopla a few months back concerning cyberboxes.  My memory <br/>
recalls that as an issue of "Art vs. Function"  I really think Art won that<br/>
one.  And what we have as a result is more patience to make whatever we do now,<br/>
while not devoid of function, nonetheless beautiful and appreciating all the<br/>
different artisic flavors and visions of our participants.  So whatever the kids<br/>
stuff turns out to be (including the sex of charatcers) let's let it be easy on<br/>
the eyes and also functional enough for the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all your recent input on Kids Corner.  Let's keep talking about<br/>
the Kids Corner and making contributions to it.  I'm here to post information<br/>
for you at will if you have any.  Just let me know. <br/>
<br/>
Dan<br/>
<br/>
Ps.  What does anybody think about an "ABC's" book icon to point to Mitch's<br/>
Stamp carving instructions for the kids?  And there might just as well be a<br/>
similar link to teach them about a compass or a map...<br/>
Comments welcome.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think the point here, Dan, is that children might relate to the characters<br/>
better if there was a boy and a girl depicted.  We don't want girls to think<br/>
of letterboxing as something that's only for boys, or vica versa.  Its for ALL<br/>
kids. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would be better to not have any human characters and stick with<br/>
animals.  Still, I think we will want some characters that are both male and<br/>
female.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody knows that Kanga is a female and Owl and Pooh are male.  Now, I'll<br/>
admit that Christopher Robin, as well as Piglet and Roo, are kinda<br/>
questionable.  Despite the first name, I always thought li'l Crissy "the<br/>
sissy" Robin was a little ambiguous when it came to sexuality.  But that's all<br/>
part of the charm and magic that exists in the simple world of "the bear of<br/>
little brain". <br/>

Uh...What did you have in mind? Does the phrase "too many cooks" ring a bell<br/>
for anyone?  I'd be scared stiff to think more than a couple people were<br/>
picking at the website for us LOL  We could really end up with a mish-mash.<br/>
If you just need artistic input, we can do that without HTML expertise. I know<br/>
only the most basic HTML commands myself. It's not hard, but it's tedious, and<br/>
I'm lazy as the day is long. I let AOL's programs do my web pages for me :-)<br/>
<br/>
I love watching this thing grow and I also happen<br/>
to love being politically incorrect much of the time :-D<br/>

hahahaha you don't watch enough TV, my friend. Kanga is the ONLY female among<br/>
Poo and his friends. No bout adoubt it as far as this Disney mom is<br/>
concerned!!!  <br/>
:-D<br/>
<br/>
I also don't think kids give a rip what gender they're clicking on when it<br/>
comes to computer games, etc.  My sons are thrilled to be the female character<br/>
if that character's skill level puts them at an advantage. No biggie at all. A<br/>
non-issue in my opinion.<br/>
