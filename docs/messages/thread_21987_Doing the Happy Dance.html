                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm so excited!  I planted a letterbox in Eklutna, AK last year, 5 miles down the trail on Eklutna Lake.  It was a wonderful stamp of the CT state flower, the mountain laurel, carved by Rush Gatherer of the Dawnlanders.  My brother likes in AK and was camping out there last night.  He checked the box for me and there were 4 entries last year and 1 this year!  For one person, it was their first letterbox!  There were other entries from some college students who got turned on to letterboxing due to this box!  I just think it's great that there are people who will go to remote areas to find these boxes.  This has truly been a very rewarding experience for me!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
