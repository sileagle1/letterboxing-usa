Whoops -- we forgot to mention that pup's first was also another first for <br/>
the whole BeMa team.  We were the first to be able to stamp in the petite In <br/>
the Park #2 new book!  We had so much to write -- and with my handwriting, <br/>
the kids' two stamps, etc.  we filled that first page up really well!<br/>
<br/>
If pup learns to behave (and stops rolling over and getting "love" from <br/>
every other four legged critter...) we will have to get her a stamp too!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we'll give her a good washing and try the Glencarlyn (spelling?) park <br/>
tomorrow -- another doggie park -- another stamp!!  It's a win - win!<br/>

Hope everyone is having as much fun as we are!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">She's still very young. It's quite natural for a new-comer to play a <br/>
submissive in a pack situation. In the beginning, Anthony played the <br/>
dominant role over Cleo, but now Cleo is definitely the alpha of the <br/>
two, and he rolls over for her.<br/>
<br/>
If you can arrange it, socializer her with another female. A good <br/>
experience will give your pup more confidence, and help her develop <br/>
good manners.<br/>
