This whimsical little stamp is Pack Rat's first box of her very own <br/>
to plant.  She (age 10) is most anxious to see who will visit it and <br/>
what stamps they'll stamp in her logbook.  Please bring a stamp pad <br/>
(box does not have one) and come to the Lake Alma State Park outside <br/>
Wellston, Ohio.  To get there, take S.R.#93 north from Wellston and <br/>
turn onto S.R. #349 just outside of town.  S.R. #349 will lead you a <br/>
couple of miles out past the water plant and across the dam that <br/>
forms Lake Alma.  (You'd never guess that 100 years ago the island <br/>
had an amusement park and interurban trains brought people from <br/>
Columbus and elsewhere to relax here!)  After you cross the dam, the <br/>
park loop road turns off to the right past the park office and the <br/>
swimming beach.  Make your way to the Old Pine Nature Trail which is <br/>
across the road from the second swimming beach.  Hike up the trail <br/>
until you reach the second water bar (treated 4x4 placed across trail <br/>
to divert water.)  The trail is quite steep and I imagine very <br/>
slippery after being rained on so be careful!  We don't want any <br/>
Purple Hearts awarded here!  Stand on the second water bar and take a <br/>
bearing of 204 and go about 6 paces (1 pace = 2 footfalls).  You <br/>
should be standing beside a very long fallen log about the point <br/>
where the roots of a smaller fallen tree lie next to it.  Look under <br/>
these roots to find our little humdinger.  Please email us at <br/>
bigguy9210@yahoo.com if you find it and tell us how it's doing.  Pack <br/>
Rat will be so excited.<br/>
