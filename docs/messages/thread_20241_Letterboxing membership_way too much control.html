                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey Y'all-remember that this is a fun, relaxed family type hobby.<br/>
<br/>
We live in a free, open country.  Stuff happens.  It will always happen.<br/>
Relax, and go with the flow.  You can't be totally safe unless you are in a<br/>
locked, padded room and what fun is that?<br/>
<br/>
Freedom = risk.  If you always knew you'd find a box there, safe every time<br/>
you go out-what fun would that be?<br/>
<br/>
We've planted two boxes, a raccoon took one, and a tree blew down and made<br/>
the other unfindable.  We replaced both and they're still out there for<br/>
people to find.  The element of adventure would sure be missing if we were<br/>
always sure.<br/>
<br/>
Deal with it!<br/>

In order to post a comment here, you have to be a member.  Out of <br/>
curiousity, for those opposed to a similar system for the LbNA <br/>
website, do you also object to the requirement to sign in to be able <br/>
to post on the group boards?  If not, what's different about the <br/>
database v. this forum that you'd have different opinions?<br/>
<br/>
I ask not to start arguments, but discussions.  I seek to understand <br/>
the opposition to the idea I proposed.<br/>
