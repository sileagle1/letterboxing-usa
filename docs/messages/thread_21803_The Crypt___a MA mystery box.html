Well, yesterday I was up in a certain area of MA and with my sister's <br/>
help (she is from that area) found the The Crypt.  Really beautiful <br/>
area that it is in.  I would have liked to spend some time walking <br/>
around, but at the time of day we went, it was getting difficult to <br/>
keep my kids quiet and calm, especially in that particular place.  <br/>
<br/>
I know that sounds cryptic (pardon the pun :P ) but the one who <br/>
planted it and those of you that have found it will understand<br/>
