Yesterday I placed a letterbox in our high school's library. The <br/>
students had to answer 5 questions, take a specific part of each <br/>
answer and then find the book that went with that call number.  Cut <br/>
into the book was a nice little hole for the stamp.  The book was <br/>
donated by the librarian (which, in their sense of humor working <br/>
overtime, was about the history of the printed book).  I gave this <br/>
assignment for extra credit, but the response has been interesting. <br/>
Those that understood the process were so excited to find the stamp <br/>
that they practically ran to my room after they stamped in! When <br/>
some of these students gave me the results (the answer sheet had to <br/>
have the stamp on it), those who did not originally get the idea or <br/>
had no motivation to do it became very curious and motivated.  <br/>
Overall the experience has been a lot of fun, heck my seniors were <br/>
trying to do it!<br/>

I think that's great.<br/>
