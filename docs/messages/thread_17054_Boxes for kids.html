in mind?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
You have given me some good ideas, thanks. I have been toying with <br/>
the idea of creating a series for kids based on nursury rhymes. I <br/>
don't have kids, but there are several boxers in my area that do. <br/>
Many of the ideas you mentioned hadn't occured to me, but I'll likely <br/>
use them for this series, possibly planted next spring.<br/>
Scoutdogs<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; You know, a lot of people on this board have children and want <br/>
&gt; children-accessible letterboxes.  Why don't a few people create <br/>
&gt; letterboxes explicitly with children in mind?  I don't have any <br/>
&gt; children and never had any desire to created such boxes myself, but <br/>
&gt; it's SOOO necessary with an activity like this!  I want people to <br/>
&gt; create boxes and say right there at the very top: This box/series <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; deliberately placed with children of such-and-such years in mind.  <br/>
&gt; The stamps would be of Disney and Pixar characters (or any other <br/>
&gt; similarly themed characters for younger people).  The clue would be <br/>
&gt; educational--teach the children what different types of trees look <br/>
&gt; like.  Don't just say look for a maple tree on the right, but <br/>
include <br/>
&gt; a diagram with a picture of a maple leaf!  (This could help adults <br/>
&gt; learn the local trees/bushes/flowers/etc as well!)  And they'd all <br/>
be <br/>
&gt; hidden in an easy-to-walk park (preferably one with a <br/>
playground).   <br/>
&gt; The boxes would be hidden low to the ground where the children can <br/>
&gt; easily reach.  The logbooks would be large since kids tend to <br/>
scrawl <br/>
&gt; rather large letters with their unpracticed hands and need the <br/>
extra <br/>
&gt; room.  The logbook would be decorated with stickers too, with lots <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; cartoon characters on the cover.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In all honestly, I've never seen one, single letterbox that I would <br/>
&gt; call "kid friendly".  Some are better candidates than others, I'll <br/>
&gt; grant you that, but I've never seen anybody hide a letterbox <br/>
&gt; deliberately with kids in mind.  At best, they've always been <br/>
&gt; for "parents with kids", with the kids as an afterthought.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since boxes for kids seems to be the theme of the day, here are a few <br/>
more thoughts about what I think would be a truly kid-friendly box:<br/>
<br/>
Make the clues with extra-large text.  Have you ever noticed <br/>
children's books?  The text tends to be larger the younger the kid is <br/>
that the book is meant for.  <br/>
<br/>
On a similar vein, the younger the kids the boxes are meant for, the <br/>
more pictures should be included in it.  Especially color ones.  Just <br/>
a visit to your nearest bookstore shows it's industry standard.  <br/>
Younger kids that can't read as well like more pictures and USE the <br/>
pictures to figure out what the text says.  (Heck, I do that while <br/>
trying to read kid's books in Spanish.  It's an eye-opener--I <br/>
essentially read Spanish texts like kids here do with English texts.)<br/>
<br/>
And the younger the kid a letterbox is designed for, the easier the <br/>
words and sentence structures should be.<br/>
<br/>
And--this is important--tell people right at the beginning of the <br/>
clue what age level the boxes are designed for.  A clue for a five <br/>
year old will be very different than a clue for a ten year old.  Both <br/>
can look for it, but set their expectations appropriately right from <br/>
the very beginning.<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn't be a bad idea at all to visit the children's section of a <br/>
bookstore and read a few books (or at least parts of them) for the <br/>
age level you have in mind to see exactly how complex the words and <br/>
text should be.<br/>
<br/>
That about does for a kid-friendly clue that I can think of off the <br/>
top of my head.<br/>
<br/>
For a kid-friendly location, an easy walk at a park with a playground <br/>
would be ideal.  The younger the kid, the shorter the walk should <br/>
be.  And make sure it's hidden low enough to the ground where the <br/>
kids can reach it.<br/>
<br/>
As extras in the boxes, you could put in a few crayons and encourage <br/>
them to draw a picture or something in the logbook.  =)  Nothing <br/>
screams "kid-friendly" than a few strategically placed crayons.  Kids <br/>
would LOVE a first-finder's certificate, I would think.  (Well <br/>
decorated with lots of colorful kid-themed stickers and such.)  Heck, <br/>
even putting a quarter in the letterbox for the first finder.  Man, <br/>
nothing made me happier when I was ten years old than to find a <br/>
quarter on the ground or in a payphone's coin return slot.  Score!  <br/>
If it's a box you check often, you could leave a quarter in it every <br/>
time you check up on the box.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm....  That's all I can think of for now.  The difference between a <br/>
kid-friendly box and a kid-accessible box is if you plant a box with <br/>
the kid in mind (kid-friendly) or with the parent in mind (kid-<br/>
accessible).<br/>
<br/>
If anyone hides a truly kid-friendly box anywhere near where I can <br/>
get to, I'd LOVE to check it out and see how you've done!  (After <br/>
all, I am a big kid at heart.  *smile*)<br/>

Colored pencils might be better.   Crayons might melt in the summertime.   I <br/>
know they would here in Florida.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As a mom of a 9 and a 2, the couple of boxes I placed are kid-<br/>
friendly in my mind, and when searching I actively seek ones that <br/>
work for the kids. To me, this means a couple of things that might <br/>
not be what you would expect:<br/>
<br/>
- As you said, the hike is shorter, or more level, and/or includes <br/>
good resting places, where snacks can be consumed. Trails lined with <br/>
blackberries are excellent.<br/>
<br/>
- A park with a playground is ideal. At the end of the trek, so the <br/>
kid is motivated to keep moving (It's easier to motivate a tired one <br/>
if they can see swings a bit off).<br/>
<br/>
- I don't dummy down directions. I have found that children rise to <br/>
the occasion. If there's something the kid (or I!) can't read or <br/>
understand, it's a chance to learn together. The non-chalant usage of <br/>
types of trees/bushes in most clues has sent us to the plant/wildlife <br/>
guide many times (it's in the backpack).<br/>
<br/>
- One nice touch I have seen on a couple boxes is steps/paces notated <br/>
in adult and kid-sized steps: "15 kid steps/8 adult." <br/>
<br/>
- Now I'm kinda funny here, but our household is media-free, which <br/>
means that the kids don't know any Disney/Pokemon/Toon-du-jour <br/>
characters. If a box advertised itself as featuring them, I would be <br/>
inclined to stay away. That's one of the reason LBing appeals to us, <br/>
it gets us away from pop culture!<br/>
<br/>
- I could go off on a tangent about how I believe that rewards-based <br/>
parenting ("good job!") can really set kids up to become praise <br/>
junkies. I like that fact that the reward is the hike itself <br/>
(especially when you can't find the box), and the thrill is seeing <br/>
what somebody else carved for you to enjoy--doubly appreciated since <br/>
you know yourself (and my kids *do*) how much effort goes into it!<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess my 'ideal' kid's box isn't going to be that much <br/>
different in their makeup or content (haven't seen blantantly adult <br/>
content in a LB yet--might be a niche!), rather only limited by <br/>
physical ability (at which point dvn2ckr will chime in about her <br/>
toddler's amazing prowess on the trails). Note that I always multiply <br/>
her estimates of time by a factor of three... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The Kenmore Rhodies box was just about right, the Savannah series was <br/>
terrific. <br/>

I have a 2 year old, 4 year old and 7 year old.  The boxes that we have <br/>
placed (sadly need to be replaced and no time yet!) were all kid friendly.  In VA, <br/>
we did a Mother Goose box and a series inspired by a book of children's poems <br/>
by Jack Prelutsky.  Another family here in VA, Bema, has placed boxes done by <br/>
thier kids with excellent kid clues.  My kids love the thrill of hunting and <br/>
figuring out the clues and they don't mind if it's hard and requires searching. <br/>
<br/>
My older son's boxes (the ones he's made) have so far all been Pokemon, but I <br/>
prefer to avoid the crass commercialism and for myself I like kid's boxes <br/>
based on books.  We did part of the Dead Author (INCREDIBLE!  I can't wait to <br/>
finish it!) series here in NoVA and it inspired my son to want to read Louisa May <br/>
Alcott and Mark Twain.  Another family in this area (Happy Homeschoolers) did <br/>
a series with botanical clues in latin (Quercas Alba = White Oak) and we <br/>
liked that a lot and for home schooling it fell into a great science lesson at the <br/>
nature center after the hunt.  I'd like to do some kid boxes with these sorts <br/>
of science clues (plant name clues, animals, habitat) as they were really fun.<br/>
It's also good to know how long the hike is (our first was like three miles <br/>
and a hill, hard on stroller and short legs!) and what the terrain is - <br/>
stroller friendly?  I have run up steep hills with a stroller on my shoulders and a <br/>
baby in it but, please, no more.... <br/>

<br/>
That's a great idea!  I'd also include in the clues when their <br/>
fruiting season is so others can take maximum advantage of it if they <br/>
choose.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I don't dummy down directions. I have found that children rise to <br/>
&gt; the occasion.<br/>
<br/>
That's good up to a point, but if you throw a Mitchner book in the <br/>
lap of a three year old, they're probably not going to rise to the <br/>
challenge.  I didn't mean to suggest that the clues should be easy to <br/>
read, but rather written for the appropriate age level.  As far as <br/>
educational purposes go, you want to challenge them, but not make it <br/>
so difficult they'll throw up their hands in frustration and want to <br/>
quit.  I'd consider a book for an eight-year-old good if it was <br/>
challenging for them, but not so much so that they're not having fun <br/>
anymore.  If it was so easy for them to read that they didn't learn a <br/>
single new word, then the age level for the book should have been <br/>
lower--younger kids might find the exact same clue a wonderful <br/>
challenge.  It's all an estimate anyhow, though, since such details <br/>
are impossible to measure precisely and what one person thinks is <br/>
perfect for an 8 year old another might say is better suited for a 10 <br/>
year old.  Even the differences among children--it might be perfect <br/>
for both of them.<br/>
<br/>
I cringe at the term "dummy down", though, since it tends to suggest <br/>
making the clues TOO easy.  But even a one year old would think "See <br/>
Spot run" is a pretty tough sentence to get a handle on.  Your child <br/>
(children?) may not have had any troubles rising to the challenge of <br/>
reading the typical clue, but children younger than your own might.<br/>
<br/>
I think the ideal clue--from a kid's perspective--is one they can <br/>
figure out completely on their own without their parent's help.  <br/>
Teach them to learn on their own, since their parent's won't always <br/>
be there to help in the future.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If there's something the kid (or I!) can't read or <br/>
&gt; understand, it's a chance to learn together.<br/>
<br/>
I'm all for making the reading challenging for educational purposes--<br/>
I *LOVE* that idea, in fact, although in the true spirit for creating <br/>
letterboxes for children, that should not be a consideration.  That's <br/>
pandoring to the parents--if the primary audience is the children, <br/>
designing a box should be done with them in mind first.  Parental <br/>
educational concerns can be addressed--as long as it doesn't make the <br/>
box less appealing for kids.<br/>
<br/>
It's important to distinguish exactly who the intended audience is: <br/>
The child or the parent of the child.  A box designed specifically <br/>
with parents in mind definitely should be educational.  A box <br/>
designed specifically for children need not be educational.  In this <br/>
particular case, I think both can be accomodated equally well, but <br/>
that's not always the case.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The non-chalant usage of types of trees/bushes in most clues has<br/>
&gt; sent us to the plant/wildlife guide many times<br/>
<br/>
Again, this is from the parent's point of view.  Most kids don't <br/>
carry around plant and wildlife guides, so the clue needs to BE the <br/>
guide.  Most five year olds can't log into the Internet and do a <br/>
websearch for a picture of a maple leaf, nor can they run off to the <br/>
nearest bookstore to buy a plant guide.  If the clue says to look <br/>
behind the maple tree, the clue should tell the child what the maple <br/>
tree looks like.  For younger children, pictures of the leaf shape or <br/>
bark might be appropriate.  For older children, a text description of <br/>
a maple tree might be fine.  For adults--let them go to the bookstore <br/>
and buy a plant/wildlife guide.  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; One nice touch I have seen on a couple boxes is steps/paces notated <br/>
&gt; in adult and kid-sized steps: "15 kid steps/8 adult." <br/>
<br/>
I'm probably taking this "for the kids" to the extreme, but a good <br/>
clue designed SPECIFICALLY for a child should contain only kid sized <br/>
steps.  Including adult sized paces is pandering to the parent once <br/>
again.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Now I'm kinda funny here, but our household is media-free, which <br/>
&gt; means that the kids don't know any Disney/Pokemon/Toon-du-jour <br/>
&gt; characters.<br/>
<br/>
Even if the household is media-free, they'll still pick up <br/>
information about Disney/Pokemon/etc characters from school friends.  <br/>
I even saw a billboard the other day for the Finding Nemo DVD.  You <br/>
can sterilize your household of advertisements, but eventually your <br/>
kids will pick up on it.  Sad though it may be, you can't protect <br/>
them from it forever.  It's a worthy cause, but one that will <br/>
eventually fail.<br/>
<br/>
But I digress on that point, because it's not really about <br/>
letterboxing.  A better point is that no letterbox can be absolutely <br/>
perfect for everyone, and this would be a good example.  Most <br/>
children would enjoy finding the traditional kid-themed characters as <br/>
stamps, but there will always be exceptions.  Ultimately, you can't <br/>
make everyone happy, but the narrower your intented audience, the <br/>
more likely you can make a letterbox that would be perfect for them.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine hiding a letterbox designed for one, specific kid in mind.  <br/>
The theme had better contain their favorite characters or the box <br/>
will have failed that kid.  Designing the box for one specific kid, <br/>
you'll get a 100% success rate.  Kids of the same age--there might be <br/>
a 90% success rate.  Some of them might not have heard of the <br/>
characters involved or even don't like the characters!  There's bound <br/>
to be a "failure" or two as the audience widens.  <br/>
<br/>
All kids--even outside of the designated age--there might be an 80% <br/>
success rate.  And the success rate for any individual letterboxer of <br/>
any age might run at 60%.  The wider the audience, the less impressed <br/>
they'll be with the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So, I guess my 'ideal' kid's box isn't going to be that much <br/>
&gt; different in their makeup or content<br/>
<br/>
What you described was a GREAT letterbox for parents.  Which is a <br/>
perfectly fine idea!  Please don't misunderstand me.  I was just more <br/>
focused on what a great letterbox for a child would be--not for the <br/>
parents of a child.  Both are worthy boxes to create, and if there <br/>
are ways to overlap the two where making a certain change would <br/>
enhance both of their pleasure, that would be great.  Or even if it <br/>
enhanced one person's pleasure but didn't affect the other's <br/>
enjoyment.  But if a change would make a parent enjoy the box more <br/>
while the child would enjoy it less (or vice-versa), you've got to <br/>
decide: Who is the box REALLY for?  The parent or the child?  And <br/>
make a decision based on that.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; haven't seen blantantly adult content in a LB yet--might be a<br/>
&gt; niche!<br/>
<br/>
I've actually considered making some blantantly adult only <br/>
letterboxes--and I'm not talking about putting them at the end of <br/>
long hikes that only adults could reach either!  (Although that would <br/>
certainly be a good place for such adult-themed boxes just to insure <br/>
kids don't find them.)<br/>
<br/>
And I even have one stamp I've carved that's borderline--not quite <br/>
bad enough to be considered "adult only", but definitely not targeted <br/>
towards kids either.  But that should be a different thread.  I don't <br/>
really have any strong opinions about the topic either way.  It's an <br/>
interesting one, though, that I'd love to hear input on from others.  <br/>
=)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Colored pencils might be better.   Crayons might melt in the<br/>
&gt; summertime.<br/>
<br/>
Excellent point.  Needless to say, that didn't occur to me.  Sounds <br/>
like you've had a bad experience with crayons before.  =)  I stand <br/>
corrected.  Yes, even us Great Ones can make mistakes.  ;o)<br/>

I'm in Florida.   We have to consider EVERYTHING melting, including the <br/>
people!<br/>
<br/>
I like the way you consider (and therefore lead us to consider) that <br/>
letterboxes can be targeted toward different audiences.<br/>
<br/>
My own favorites are what I'd call "family" letterboxes.   The fact is, the <br/>
kids aren't going to be out there by themselves, so if they run into a clue for <br/>
which the parent has to get out the field guide and show them how to look up <br/>
a plant or animal, that's a good thing.   We found one at a nature center this <br/>
weekend where the stamp was carved on a theme that tied in with what we saw <br/>
at the nature center, and I think we all learned a bit about the subject--not <br/>
to mention my son was pretty excited about seeing the critters!<br/>
<br/>
I've noticed in the logbooks in my boxes, there are a lot of moms with kids <br/>
boxing around here, so very often I'll try to make my boxes an "adventure" for <br/>
them.   I'm thinking of planting one they can ride the train to, I'm putting <br/>
one in a park where there's an army tank on display, that a lot of people <br/>
probably wouldn't know about if the box didn't lead them to the park.   So my clues <br/>
aren't geared particularly to the kids doing the actual searching, but the <br/>
boxes are definitely planted with kids in mind.<br/>

I'd have to borrow one to write the paces :-) Of course, just as with adults, kids are different heights and have different strides, so I think it would be hard to do this. At what age do you think most kids would get the concept of a pace key (Giving a defined area/distance and saying how many steps/paces it is, so that the finders steps/paces can be adjusted to accommodate)?<br/>
For short distances, I could buy a pair of kids shoes and do heel to toe measurements :-) Could you just picture someone seeing me on the trail while I was doing the step count! Lol "I didn't escape, I have a day pass"<br/>

That's a perfectly fine audience for a letterbox as well.  Young kids <br/>
are particularly unique in the sense that they're probably the only <br/>
letterboxers that you can almost bet on not being alone, and trying <br/>
to accomodate the adult as well is definitely a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, though, if you have an idea for developing a letterbox <br/>
with two different types of people in mind (in this case, a child and <br/>
the parents of a child), and you have this great idea that kids would <br/>
absolutely LOVE (i.e. Let's put lots of glitter in the box!) that <br/>
parents might not (ugh, the mess!), then you'll need to narrow your <br/>
focus and decide--who comes first?  A clue that lists only adult <br/>
sized steps but neglects child sized steps is geared more towards the <br/>
parent rather than the child, and the child could get more frustrated <br/>
with the clue than is otherwise necessary.  (A clue that lists both <br/>
kid sized and adult sized paces is obviously targeted to a "family", <br/>
rather than either of them.  Or, another interesting idea--create one <br/>
set of clues for kids to follow and another set of clues for the <br/>
adults to use.)<br/>
<br/>
I love the art of creating the perfect letterbox.  =)  It's so easy <br/>
to throw out a box without putting much effort or thought into it, <br/>
but wow--the amazing things people can do with even a bit of <br/>
consideration for their intended audience.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Of course, just as with adults, kids are different heights and have<br/>
&gt; different strides<br/>
<br/>
Steps and paces tend to be estimates anyhow since even adults have <br/>
different strides.  Ideally you'd find a kid of the age range the box <br/>
is designed for and have him or her measure out the paces for you, <br/>
but without a kid--just take a guess.  It's still likely to be more <br/>
accurate for a kid than the actual steps you took.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps some boxers on this board that have kids could help out by <br/>
sharing how many kid sized paces tend to make up an adult's sized <br/>
pace.  Off the cuff, I'd guess 2 kid steps is approximately 1 adult <br/>
step, but I'm just guessing.  Experienced letterboxers who have kids <br/>
are very likely to know, though!  =)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Kudos so far for all the great ideas for kid oriented boxes. <br/>
<br/>
When you are writing your clues for these boxes, why not tell kids to <br/>
make sure they bring along a shoe lace, soft rope, string or cord of <br/>
a predetermined length, say 2." I wouldn't recommend something like a <br/>
stick, though that would be age appropriate I expect. I think kids <br/>
would love to pull out their piece of shoe lace/rope/string/cord or <br/>
stick so they could measure out the clue writer's distance from a <br/>
particular landmark to the box. If you check your boxes often, you <br/>
could also furnish and replenish pieces of a certain length of string <br/>
in one box that helps kids find the next one(s). This way, the length <br/>
of a pace or step becomes a non-issue and even little kids who can't <br/>
read yet get to participate and follow their string to find the box.<br/>
<br/>
You could also print off drawings or photos that are related to the <br/>
letterbox and use the first few pages of the log book for a scrapbook <br/>
of these items that kids could use to identify certain trees or <br/>
plants to make the box both fun and educational.  <br/>

We just did orienteering with my son's Cub Scout den.   They're 10- and <br/>
11-year olds, and their paces worked out to right about 2 feet per step (meaning <br/>
one footfall).<br/>
<br/>
When I planted letterboxes for them at our campout, I just shortened my <br/>
strides, keeping that measurement in mind and "guesstimated."   It seemed to work <br/>
out, since everyone got the boxes with no problem.   Smaller kids, of course, <br/>
would mean smaller strides.   (Duh! <g>)<br/>

I've done 6 workshops for the local kindegartens and the 5 year olds <br/>
figured out paces and steps no problem. There were variables in the <br/>
babysteps to giant steps range but I taught them to understand that <br/>
and look a little ahead and a little behind where they stop for the <br/>
logical neext clue. ie:  "take ten paces to the small trail on the <br/>
right" well if they fall short they will notice the  trail a couple <br/>
steps ahead.  It has been working pretty well with them. I also <br/>
taught some groups of tiger cubs  age 7 compass reading and they had <br/>
the basics in a jiffy going all over the school on compass readings <br/>
to find boxes hidden indoors for theoccasion. No lost kids after dark <br/>
that way!  Anyway kids really can grasp it uquite well the steps and <br/>
mechanics won't be as much problem as inferred clues and language <br/>
above their level. So keep that in mind and have the kids enjoy. Most <br/>
of my boxes are done with kids in mind some in story clues, some <br/>
straight forward and some more elusive but I think they  must almost <br/>
always come up with the box. There are lots of happy stamps in the <br/>
box journals and lots of kids in that.  Good luck let me know if I <br/>
can be of any assistance  Leader of the Pack<br/>

  Thanks for all the great ideas everyone. I like the idea of 'kid sized'<br/>
steps/paces, but I don't have kids. I'd have to borrow one to write the<br/>
paces :-) Of course, just as with adults, kids are different heights and<br/>
have different strides, so I think it would be hard to do this. At what age<br/>
do you think most kids would get the concept of a pace key (Giving a defined<br/>
area/distance and saying how many steps/paces it is, so that the finders<br/>
steps/paces can be adjusted to accommodate)?<br/>
  For short distances, I could buy a pair of kids shoes and do heel to toe<br/>
measurements :-) Could you just picture someone seeing me on the trail while<br/>
I was doing the step count! Lol "I didn't escape, I have a day pass"<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Why don't a few people create letterboxes explicitly with children<br/>
&gt; in mind?&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You have given me some good ideas, thanks. I have been toying with<br/>
&gt; the idea of creating a series for kids based on nursury rhymes. I<br/>
&gt; don't have kids, but there are several boxers in my area that do.<br/>
&gt; Many of the ideas you mentioned hadn't occured to me, but I'll likely<br/>
&gt; use them for this series, possibly planted next spring.<br/>
&gt; Scoutdogs<br/>
<br/>
I didn't see Ryan's original post for some reason (maybe my kids were<br/>
bugging me at the moment!) Anyhow, I recently planted several boxes in my<br/>
area with the "playground set" in mind ("Mom, She's Bugging Me" nos. 1-4).<br/>
My motivation was the fact that I do box with my kids most of the time, and<br/>
sometimes they are not into the whole "boxing" activity, but can be molified<br/>
with some playground time. So, the boxes are planted in little neighborhood<br/>
parks within a few hundred yards of the playground area. The clues are<br/>
little mind-teasers for the parents, though--thinking back to my days of<br/>
seemingly endless, mind-numbing swing pushing. I thought that parents might,<br/>
if they're not able to get out on an envigorating scenic hike, at least<br/>
appreciate a little mental stimulation. Older sibs should be able to figure<br/>
out the clues, though (9 yo or so--about the age they start enjoying<br/>
children's mystery fiction). I did make sure the stamps were mounted, so<br/>
they'd be easier for smaller hands to handle, and I may revisit and put some<br/>
crayons in so the littler ones can sign the log book. Perhaps this falls<br/>
under the category of "for parents, with kids as an afterthought." I've got<br/>
more stamps that go with the theme that I haven't planted yet, so I may do<br/>
some more specifically for kids to find (possibly pairing them with the<br/>
parent boxes?)<br/>
<br/>
If you don't have kids of your own, you might try "field testing" a<br/>
placement/set of clues with someone else's. And it might be a good idea to<br/>
place the box somewhere where you can do more-than-usual frequency of<br/>
maintenance, to cut down on the frustration of missing boxes, wet log books,<br/>
etc.<br/>

Subject: Re: Boxes for kids<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; My own favorites are what I'd call "family" letterboxes.   The fact<br/>
&gt;&gt; is, the kids aren't going to be out there by themselves<br/>
<br/>
&gt;That's a perfectly fine audience for a letterbox as well.  Young kids<br/>
&gt;are particularly unique in the sense that they're probably the only<br/>
&gt;letterboxers that you can almost bet on not being alone, and trying<br/>
&gt;to accomodate the adult as well is definitely a good idea.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ultimately, though, if you have an idea for developing a letterbox<br/>
&gt;with two different types of people in mind (in this case, a child and<br/>
&gt;the parents of a child), and you have this great idea that kids would<br/>
&gt;absolutely LOVE (i.e. Let's put lots of glitter in the box!) that<br/>
&gt;parents might not (ugh, the mess!), then you'll need to narrow your<br/>
&gt;focus and decide--who comes first?  A clue that lists only adult<br/>
&gt;sized steps but neglects child sized steps is geared more towards the<br/>
&gt;parent rather than the child, and the child could get more frustrated<br/>
&gt;with the clue than is otherwise necessary.  (A clue that lists both<br/>
&gt;kid sized and adult sized paces is obviously targeted to a "family",<br/>
&gt;rather than either of them.  Or, another interesting idea--create one<br/>
&gt;set of clues for kids to follow and another set of clues for the<br/>
&gt;adults to use.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I love the art of creating the perfect letterbox.  =)  It's so easy<br/>
&gt;to throw out a box without putting much effort or thought into it,<br/>
&gt;but wow--the amazing things people can do with even a bit of<br/>
&gt;consideration for their intended audience.<br/>
<br/>
With all due respect, Ryan--I think your idea of "kid friendly" is focusing<br/>
on "can be solved by kid alone with minimal/no parental involvement," and<br/>
that focus may be somewhat misplaced. Younger kids, especially, get more<br/>
enjoyment out of doing things WITH their parents, rather than by themselves.<br/>
So, for a younger kid (I'd say up to about 6 or 7 years), a "family<br/>
friendly" box that involved more interaction between parent and child would,<br/>
in fact, be more "kid friendly" than a box that they did completely on their<br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
In that regard, we should perhaps take a cue from childen's rule-based<br/>
games, and how they play them. Those that are intended for younger children<br/>
are designed so the kid can see where they are supposed to go, how far,<br/>
etc., but they still need a parent to help explain the rules, etc. A 4-yo<br/>
can play Candyland--with an adult's help. I think it'd be exceptional 4-yos<br/>
that could play Candyland against each other. And no, I don't want to hear<br/>
from anyone whose 5-yo plays chess with her genuis baby brother.<br/>
<br/>
Or, you might take a a cue from orienteering. Now, theoretically, some<br/>
orienteering meets offer a "string" course, which is a very short, easy<br/>
course designed for kids, where they literally follow along a string to the<br/>
controls. Except, none of the orienteering meets in my area seem to offer<br/>
the string courses anymore, due to lack of popularity, I suppose. Most kids,<br/>
it seems, would rather do the beginner's "white" course with a parent. By<br/>
the time they are *interested* in doing things on their own, they're usually<br/>
able to handle the white course solo.<br/>
<br/>
On the subject of paces: of course, it varies depending on age, size of<br/>
child (my 1st grade daughter weighs 40 lbs, while her 1st grade cousin is<br/>
more than twice that), tired factor, etc. In my experience, kids tend to<br/>
step big when they know they're counting steps. And they also have bigger<br/>
strides, in general, than you might imagine (definitely not 2:1, unless<br/>
you're talking very small child, like a 3-yo, maybe). My son is a short 8-yo<br/>
and yet his strides are probably only about 20% shorter than mine. The other<br/>
thing to keep in mind is not only calibrating the paces is how many a kid<br/>
can count at what age. Some kids can count to 100 in kindergarten, but<br/>
others that age are still dicey after 10.<br/>
<br/>
On a different note (for those of you thinking about doing kid-friendly<br/>
boxes): although there's nothing wrong with series, per se, and they can<br/>
always be broken down into smaller parts, I find that my kids (5 and 8,<br/>
fwiw) start to roll their eyes after the 2nd box.<br/>
<br/>
And on a final note: I'd ordered two 12x18 sheets of 1/4 rubber from Dick<br/>
Blick, thinking it'd be similar to the PZCut rubber, only bigger. I<br/>
discovered it was too rubbery for fine detail, so I gave one to each of my<br/>
kids. They are both quite handy with the speedball #1 gouge, and they were<br/>
both ECSTATIC. Of course, now I need more ink for my stamp pads (and more<br/>
PZCut for my stamps).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As I'm sure you recall, we discussed boxing with<br/>
scouts a couple months ago, when some of us were<br/>
thinking about trying it, and then actually did it.<br/>
<br/>
We took our six boys out boxing, all of them 2nd<br/>
grade/7-8 years old.  I tried to expose them to every<br/>
type of basic navigation when I wrote the clues:  we<br/>
used very basic compass readings, visual sighting, and<br/>
paces.  <br/>
<br/>
The compass readings were a little tough for them, but<br/>
they managed them all the same.  The visual clues were<br/>
much easier for them than they were for the adults. <br/>
My husband was adamant about excluding a particular<br/>
clue which called for them to spot the "stairs to the<br/>
stairs".  He absolutely couldn't visualize it, but<br/>
they quickly got it - it was a short set of steps<br/>
leading to playground equipment, and among the<br/>
playground equipment was a short ladder to a platform.<br/>
 I DID make it a point to remind him that he felt that<br/>
clue was too hard!<br/>
<br/>
Paces - they did just fine with them.  Surprisingly,<br/>
they really got the idea of a pace key - pacing a<br/>
known distance to see how their paces compared, so<br/>
they could do the next leg of pacing to an unknown<br/>
location and make minor adjustments.  Of course, they<br/>
all had adults with them to help them out a bit, but<br/>
any kid out letterboxing should have an adult with<br/>
them also (gosh, I hope that doesn't generate<br/>
controversy - LOL).  <br/>
<br/>
When my daughter and I calculated paces for the clues,<br/>
we walked heel to toe, visually adding about 6 inches<br/>
between heel and toe.  I realize that isn't very<br/>
exact, but it did work and no one came and asked for<br/>
help with pace-related clues.  We stationed ourselves<br/>
in the general center of the field of boxes so they<br/>
could return to us and ask questions if needed.  If I<br/>
were planting boxes for strangers and I knew I wasn't<br/>
going to be on hand to help them out, I would borrow a<br/>
real kid and work on measuring a pace.  You could work<br/>
with the kid, walking with him or her while someone<br/>
else counts his pace and you count your own, then<br/>
divide the kids' paces by your own to arrive at a pace<br/>
factor.  You should then be able to pace off anywhere<br/>
and multiply your own pace count by your factor to<br/>
figure out how many paces you should note in your<br/>
clues.  You should probably also note in your clue the<br/>
age and height of the test kid.  OR, as an<br/>
alternative, you could just borrow the kid every time<br/>
you wanted to go plant boxes and let them give you<br/>
real paces.  Of course, you realize that kids who<br/>
provide specialized services such as this should be<br/>
compensated for their expertise - candy usually works<br/>
fine.<br/>

****This is a great idea!  I learned, when we set out<br/>
boxes for our scouts, that kids have a distinctly<br/>
different way of looking at things and have quite a<br/>
different perspective as well.  One clue we used was<br/>
to "find the stump the height of a Wolf Cub".  Well,<br/>
our boys were Wolf Cubs, so they had to look for a<br/>
stump as tall as themselves.  The adults tended to <br/>
overlook the stump, but the kids felt like they were<br/>
eye-to-eye with it and didn't understand how the<br/>
adults missed it (actually, neither do I, but that's<br/>
another question for another day I guess).<br/>
<br/>
Giving two sets of clues for each audience might<br/>
really make the letterboxing experience more 3-D!<br/>

&gt; children rise to the occasion. If there's something<br/>
&gt; the kid (or I!) can't read or understand, it's a &gt;  <br/>
chance to learn together. The non-chalant usage   &gt; of<br/>
types of trees/bushes in most clues has sent us &gt; to<br/>
the plant/wildlife guide many times (it's in the &gt;<br/>

something about nature in order to solve the problem<br/>

they don't mind it nearly as much when I say "Hmmm...a<br/>

maybe we can find it in our field guide."  I promise<br/>
you, by the time I finish saying it, my 7 year old is<br/>
already digging the book out of my backpack!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; - Now I'm kinda funny here, but our household is<br/>
&gt; media-free, which means that the kids don't know any<br/>
&gt; Disney/Pokemon/Toon-du-jour characters. If a box &gt;  <br/>
advertised itself as featuring them, I would be <br/>
&gt; inclined to stay away. That's one of the reason<br/>
&gt; LBing appeals to us, it gets us away from pop  &gt;    <br/>
culture!<br/>
<br/>
****My home isn't media free (oh how I wish it were!),<br/>

around catchy characters you find on lunch boxes and<br/>

Listen up, everyone!  I'm deferring all future kid box questions and <br/>
comments to La Chola, because she seems to know more about them than <br/>
I do.  I'm just throwing out ideas, but I'd NEVER claim to be an <br/>
expert on kids because I'm most certainly not--which is why I'm so <br/>
incredibly unqualified to hide kid boxes myself.  But La Chola seems <br/>
to know what she's talking about, and until she proves herself wrong, <br/>
I'll give her the benefit of a doubt.  =)  She's got some interesting <br/>
ideas as the very least.<br/>
<br/>
Carpe diem!<br/>

LOL--I'd be happy to loan you a couple for as long as it takes you to master<br/>
the mysteries of their tiny minds!<br/>
<br/>
(Thanks for bringing up the topic, by the way. I've gotten a lot of good<br/>
ideas, too.)<br/>

You want to see carried away with numbers?  Check out my Paul Revere <br/>

Has anyone managed to find that box yet?  I know a couple of people <br/>
had figured out Part I, but it takes a really determined individual <br/>
to unlock the whole clue!<br/>
