time I'd had to use a compass, and my technique needs a bit of refinement.  My <br/>
husband, the former Boy Scout, had much better luck.<br/>
<br/>
I've also planted one (my first!) in a different park in this area.  Planted <br/>
it last week, but I wanted to make my husband follow the clues before I posted <br/>
them, to make sure they worked.  Hopefully I'll get the clues up tonight.<br/>
