near Port Angeles, WA<br/>
Clallam County<br/>
<br/>
Placed:  1 Aug 2002<br/>
By:  DVN2R CKR<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Approximately 3 miles round trip (to the box and back to the parking <br/>
lot) through alpine meadows with glorious views.  Paved trail climbs <br/>
to a panoramic view of mountains and saltwater. 700 foot elevation <br/>
change.  This letterbox is within the Olympic Mountains National <br/>
Park just south of the beautiful town of Port Angeles, WA which <br/>
overlooks the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  Bring your Golden Eagle or <br/>
National Park pass or be prepared to pay the approx. $10 entrance <br/>
fee at the park entrance station 5 miles beyond the Port Angeles <br/>
Visitor Center.  <br/>
<br/>
Hurricane Ridge Road:  Open 24 hours a day mid May into October.  <br/>
The rest of the year opens (weather permitting) primarily on <br/>
weekends.  Call (360) 565-3131 for current conditions.  Not sure if <br/>
the Hurricane Hill/Ridge trail system is open to snow shoe-rs during <br/>
the winter--it might be! <br/>
<br/>
Note:  This hike ends at 5,700' elevation.  The elevation change <br/>
during the hike to the letterbox is approximately 650'ensure<br/>
you are healthy and physically able to undertake a challenging trek <br/>
at such a high elevation.  My almost 4-year old daughter had little <br/>
difficulty on this trail but she is quite athletic.  Plan <br/>
accordingly!  This is also black bear and cougar countrybe <br/>
perpetually vigilant!  No pets are allowed on the trail.  Bring <br/>
water, food and windbreakers/raincoats as there are no amenities <br/>
along the trail.  Take a camera, as well, since the views from the <br/>
top are absolutely breathtaking!<br/>
<br/>
Start your trek at the Hurricane Hill trailhead (18.5 miles from the <br/>
Port Angeles Visitor Center to the parking lot for the trail//1.5 <br/>
miles past the Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center).  From the trailhead <br/>
parking lot, it will take about 1 to 1-1/2 hours to hike to the top <br/>
&amp; find the letterbox (weather permitting).  It will take about <br/>
another 30 minutes to descend the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES TO 'Bear'ly the top of Hurricane Ridge Letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
*Be prepared to be blown away (by beauty) on the Hurricane Hill <br/>
trail!<br/>
<br/>
*Proceed on the trail, <br/>
Take your time, you won't fail.<br/>
<br/>
*Seek the `Folded Rock',<br/>
Tis the next goal on your walk.<br/>
<br/>
*Another trail to the `river'?<br/>
Might make your heart shiver,<br/>
So toward left you should steer,<br/>
If to Hurricane Hill you'd like to veer.<br/>
<br/>
*A `sculptor of wind'?<br/>
Twill be what you now must find.<br/>
<br/>
*Through some pines you will wind,<br/>
Take a break, you're doing fine.<br/>
<br/>
*Past the `Lingering Snow'?<br/>
On the main trail you must go!<br/>
<br/>
*Steep switchbacks are fine,<br/>
Soon your face will shine.<br/>
<br/>
*'North vs West'?<br/>
Past this sign is your quest!<br/>
<br/>
*Continue on the (paved/gravel) path for your climb,<br/>
Boy, these words sure are tough to rhyme!<br/>
<br/>
*Just about to the top?<br/>
Is where you want to stop.<br/>
<br/>
* "Over-look" for the sign,<br/>
Sooketo Mt Baker is just fine!<br/>
<br/>
*From the Mt Baker side (of the map),<br/>
16 paces, within a 7' tall stump the box does hide!<br/>
<br/>
(Please be discreet as this is a very popular location!)<br/>
<br/>
*Look inside for your `bear'y fun letterbox!<br/>
Please return me when you're through,<br/>
Put some bark atop me, that will do!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE:  This letterbox is essentially an<br/>
`orphan' as we are unable to visit it regularly.  Please email me <br/>
when you find it at blee@pobox.com or dvn2rckr@yahoo.com.  Please <br/>
bring some extra letterboxing info sheets/pens with you when you go <br/>
to `clean it up' in the event it needs it.  Perhaps a <br/>
fellow `letterboxer' from Port Angeles could adopt it  ;)  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  <br/>
Happy trails &amp; Godspeed, little bear!!!<br/>
