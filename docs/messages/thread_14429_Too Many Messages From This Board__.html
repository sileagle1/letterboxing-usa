This message board receives a LOT of messages, and you don't have to <br/>
get each individual one at home.  You can change your settings to <br/>
only receive a "daily digest" of the messages, to receive "special <br/>
notices only", or to receive "no mail" which keeps you on the list, <br/>
but you have to come to the web to read the posts.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what you do:<br/>
Open your web browser and come to the website for this message board:<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa<br/>
<br/>
In the upper right hand side of the main page, it will say "edit my <br/>
membership".  That's where you can specify how you want your messages <br/>
delivered.  <br/>
<br/>
Once you fix that, you can click at the top right where it says "my <br/>
groups" and adjust any of the other lists you are on quite easily.  <br/>
For example - on the announce list ( <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lbox-announce )  I just get the digest, <br/>
and scan through it each day to see if there are any new boxes in my <br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought this might be helpful.  200+ messages in any given <br/>
period will lock up some email systems and give quota violations, <br/>
etc. I'm sure that creates problems for some of us!<br/>

daily digest, due to the activity of the posting.<br/>
<br/>
I like when people put a state abbreviation in the Subject line, then <br/>
I know if it might be of particular interest to me.<br/>
<br/>
General questions such as carving, clue and box making skills I <br/>
usually read, but many "state" headed subjects I will skip unless a <br/>
topic catches my fancy.<br/>
<br/>
I could not handle the individual e mails form this site and the 5 <br/>
other Yahoo boards I subscribe to.<br/>

It is very important for folks to put the State in the subject line <br/>

Florida could evolve into a discussion of Mosquitoes and insect <br/>

The question of how to unsub from this group is a frequent post.<br/>
Thanks for such a succint set of instructions. These instructions<br/>
could be placed in the FAQ on letterboxing.org. When another newbie<br/>
posts (probably next week!) about wanting to unsub, someone can say to<br/>
check the FAQ instead of reiterating the instructions word for word.<br/>
