folks seem to have a way of hiding their LBs a little too much out in <br/>
the open for my taste, and I've taken to adding a few more leaves and <br/>

Thank you Gnosis!!  <br/>

<br/>
I do have a trail name.  It is California Bear.<br/>
<br/>
I had my e-mail set up to automatically attach my name to every outgoing mail and I always forget to change it to read California Bear.  I finally removed the automatic one.  Hopefully I will remember to add a sig line when I send me e-mails now.  : )<br/>

Very cool!  I would love to run out and grab those tomorrow.  Unfortunately, I have previous obligations.  :(  I was looking at my calendar and it may be Sept. before I can get out and do any serious hunting.  :`` (<br/>
