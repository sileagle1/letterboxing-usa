waiting for the spring freshets to be done with, so my husband and I <br/>
can canoe there from Hadlyme.  I grew up in Haddam Neck which is up-<br/>
river from Seldon Creek so naturally this is a favorite and very <br/>
special part of the planet for me. Thanks again for planting the <br/>
boxes.   Cat lover/gardener/teacher<br/>
