                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  That is quite the letterboxing marathon, and some long days!  I <br/>
was looking at a couple of those days, thinking I would have to push <br/>
to get all of those boxes checked in that amount of time, and I know <br/>
where I am going, and a few shortcuts!  Great job, sounds like a fun <br/>
weekend (all except those darn sand dunes).<br/>
<br/>
And thanks for the report, it is really appreciated.  A few that you <br/>
found had been reported to possibly be missing by others, so it was <br/>
good to hear they are intact.  Another group also reported the <br/>
Holland Lighthouse box missing over the weekend, hope you didn't <br/>
spend too much time there.  They did however, find the DeZwaan <br/>
Windmill box.  As for Tulip Time Twist...  I know you had the right <br/>
park.  I stopped there a few days ago and the box was safe and sound, <br/>
but I certainly see where that one could get you twisted around!<br/>
<br/>
Congrats on your 100th find!<br/>
<br/>
Deb (SpringChick)<br/>
(who needs to stop placing boxes and start finding boxes to get <br/>
anywhere near 100...)<br/>

&gt; We didn't make it to Grand Traverse, Grand Rapids, or Kalamazoo as <br/>
&gt; planned, but we had a great time and will be back again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some other notes....Forgot clues for "Spring Fling"<br/>
&gt;                     Looked without any solid ideas for De Zwann<br/>
&gt;                     Spent 4 hours looking for Tulip Time    <br/>
&gt;                     Twist...frustrating...couldn't find it and had <br/>
&gt;                     to give up:(<br/>

&gt; Whew!...After a very slow going and frustrating first day, and a <br/>
long <br/>
&gt; but productive 2nd day that left us both unable to walk and eating <br/>
&gt; Advil like candy, we were able to pick up the pace, get lucky at <br/>
&gt; times and have the Letterboxing gods smile on us.  We hit our 100th <br/>
&gt; box with "The Big House"!  A little cool by the lake for most of <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; weekend, a little rain at the beginning, but very nice at the end.  <br/>
&gt; We didn't make it to Grand Traverse, Grand Rapids, or Kalamazoo as <br/>
&gt; planned, but we had a great time and will be back again.<br/>
