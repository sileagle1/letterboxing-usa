Gone FISHING for letterboxeRs lately?  <br/>
<br/>
This is the perfect time to meet some letterboxeRs in Idaho.  You'll <br/>
have some FISHY letterboxes to find as well.  The theme is anything <br/>
FISHY.  Can you smell it?  So if you like, dress like a FISH, flop <br/>
like a FISH, bring FISHY food, or whatever you FISH like.  It might <br/>
not have to taste FISHY, but how about look FISHY, or feel FISHY?  <br/>
Bring some tasty FISH snacks/drinks for others to enjoy.  Get your <br/>
scales ready as you won't want to miss out on all the FISH fun.  <br/>
<br/>
Is this event FISHY enough for even J-Bear to attend?        <br/>
<br/>
Bring your friends and family and meet other letterboxers.  <br/>
<br/>
An option is to forget the FISH altogether, and come as you are, but <br/>
remember your letterboxing logbook and stamp to exchange with <br/>
others.  Dare you bring a HitchHiker to exchange in the hostel.  Go <br/>
FISH!   <br/>
