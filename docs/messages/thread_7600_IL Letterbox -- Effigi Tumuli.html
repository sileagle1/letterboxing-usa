                    <div class="plaintext-content">My family and I are currently visiting family in the midwest and have <br/>
been letterboxing all along the way.  We happen to have family in the <br/>
Starved Rock area and as a result, we are very familiar with the <br/>
area.  However, we are regretful to report that one letterbox seems <br/>
to be more difficult than we anticipated.<br/>
<br/>
Let me premise this by saying that we're not usually upset when we <br/>
don't find a letterbox, but I guess some of the circumstances caused <br/>
us to be so in this case.  <br/>
<br/>
Despite the fact that the literature for the park specifically asks <br/>
you NOT to leave the trail and tread on the landscape sculptures, and <br/>
the fact that there were waist-high, allergy-inducing grass <br/>
throughout, we went to the "frog" and followed the rest of the <br/>
directions.  <br/>
<br/>
Having nothing but "a circle of aspens" as a final clue, along with <br/>
many cuts on my legs from treading through the high grass from one <br/>
group of aspens to another, I have decided in hindsight that the <br/>
final clue "a circle of aspens" is quite inadequate.  As the "Hiding <br/>
Clues" section of the letterbox web site states, it should not have <br/>
been difficult for us to find the box once we deciphered the other <br/>
clues, but alas, we did the hard work and left empty handed.  <br/>
<br/>
As I said above, we have never been upset about not finding <br/>
letterboxes before, but this time I think that the final destination <br/>
needs to be more adequately described.  To eliminate the possibility <br/>
that I am simply bitter about all of this, could other who have <br/>
actually found "Effigi Tumuli" please sound off if they actually <br/>
found the box?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
