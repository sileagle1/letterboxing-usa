<br/>
Park in the trailhead parking and head up the Oneonta Trail.  At the<br/>

branch and continue on a ways.  When you come to an immovable boulder<br/>
about 2-1/2 feet high jutting out left center of the trail (in the<br/>
middle of the path for all purposes) Stop.  Reach down, touch your toes<br/>

Ring-Tailed Lemur lingers.<br/>

<br/>
We're new to letterboxing and decided to try the Columbia Gorge for our<br/>
first outing.  Looks like we missed you by one day on the Oneonta trail - we<br/>
were there Sunday and found the Horsetail Falls and Triple Falls boxes.  I<br/>
retrieved the Hitchcock Hitchhiker from the Triple Falls box and will be<br/>
planting it today at the Finch Arboretum box in Spokane.<br/>
<br/>
We tried Maryhill Museum on the way home Monday - but it appears as though<br/>
the grounds have changed somewhat since the clues were posted.  We found the<br/>
area where the Peacocks like to hang out, and we took a compass reading from<br/>
beneath the Men's room sign.  As you walk to the furthest tree (towards the<br/>
Museum), at the southwestern-most corner of the group of trees, there are<br/>
several stumps where trees have been cut down.  Also, there is no 'brush'<br/>
per se - the area is a garden now - we felt a little strange walking into<br/>
the garden looking under bushes (there's a huge Oregon Grape plant there)<br/>
and it wasn't long before we attracted the attention of a gardener.  We<br/>
calmly left the area, admiring the rest of the gardens on the way out.  The<br/>
gardener tailed us all the way to the car.  So, I don't know if the box is<br/>
still there or not.  Have you heard of it being found recently?<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
