<br/>
B: I'm unarmed! And I'm coming out.<br/>
<br/>
LBP: Keep your hands where I can see them. . .I see Tupperware <br/>
and . . . some ink stains. You're okay.<br/>
<br/>
B: Is something wrong, officer?<br/>
<br/>
LBP: No, no, nothing to be alarmed about. I'm the local Letterboxing <br/>
Police, just making my rounds and saw some activity near this here <br/>
box. Thought it might be a Noxer.<br/>
<br/>
B: Oh no, I'm a letterboxer alright. I stamped into 43 boxes today <br/>
so far.<br/>
<br/>
LBP: Oh, speedboxing, eh?<br/>
<br/>
B: Um, well, that is - <br/>
<br/>
LBP: Nothing to be shamed of. Folks do it all the time. Running <br/>
willy-nilly through the woods. Everybody sees 'em. Even the noxers.<br/>
<br/>
B: I know I should be more discreet . . .<br/>
<br/>
LBP: Oh, no, you're fine. There's no rule that says you have to keep <br/>
it a secret. Heck, I say the more the merrier. Trampin' up the <br/>
woods. Givin' interviews. Diggin' holes in parks. Yellin' "I FOUND <br/>
THE BOX!" and such. Heh heh.  Carrying on so even the Noxers know <br/>
there's something in there. How many have you placed yourself?<br/>
<br/>
B: Um, well, none so far. But I have plans to . . .<br/>
<br/>
LBP: Oh, don't bother yourself. There's no rule saying you have to <br/>
plant. There are more newbies every day, let somebody else worry <br/>
about planting them. Besides, what are your carving skills like, <br/>
anyway?<br/>
<br/>
B: They're just fine, I'll have you know. Better than the stamp in <br/>
THIS box anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
LBP: Yeh, this stamp pretty much stinks. Here, let's take an exacto <br/>
blade and fix this thing.<br/>
<br/>
B: You mean . . . alter someone's carving?<br/>
<br/>
LBP: Sure! Nothing says we can't! We're just improving it. I'm sure <br/>
they'd agree their carving skills are poor. Let's see, shave a <br/>
little here, gouge a little there, NOW it looks like a birdy. . . if <br/>
you squint.<br/>
<br/>
B: It's supposed to be a kitten. The box is called "A Kitten for <br/>
You."<br/>
<br/>
LBP: Kittens are stupid. Now let's box this baby back up.<br/>
<br/>
B: I have the plastic baggies here. It was double bagged and I . . .<br/>
<br/>
LBP: I don't bother with those, especially if you're speed boxing. <br/>
Takes too much time.  You sure all this stuff was in the same <br/>
Tupperware? It doesn't seem to close all the way. Well, no worries, <br/>
just rip out a few of the log pages and fold the stamp in half and <br/>
there ya go. Give it a good fling.<br/>
<br/>
B: Fling?<br/>
<br/>
LBP: Yep, just toss back toward where you found it. Though, it is <br/>
fun to sometimes toss it a little distance the other way.<br/>
<br/>
B: But that's not where I found it. You're supposed to . . .<br/>
<br/>
LBP: Supposed to - SCHMAposed to. There are no rules! Now give it a <br/>
fling and I'll show you where a mystery box is.<br/>
<br/>
B: Hey, wait a minute. If there are no rules, then how is there a <br/>
Letterboxing Police?<br/>
<br/>
LBP: . . . I, um, like the uniform.<br/>

I do not recall my office being contacted about this matter.<br/>
I believe the person you had a run in with was an impostor.<br/>
Please be advised just because someone flashes a badge to you does not <br/>
make them who they say they are. This could have been a very dangerous <br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
You must be more cautious.<br/>
