I've placed one box (with three stamps, since I couldn't choose only <br/>
one, lol), but since there aren't any boxes in my near neighborhood <br/>
(yet), I haven't actually ever seen one. I've been lurking on the list <br/>
trying to learn quietly, but can't figure out what makes for a "great <br/>
box." (Don't worry, I understand that it's all creative and up to the <br/>
individual and that the journey is the reward, blah blah blah, but <br/>
surely when you all gush about a great box, you're talking about the <br/>
contents, not just the tupperware, right? What's in there besides the <br/>
stamp, pad, and log book?) Also, was I supposed to write something in <br/>
my log book when I placed my box? I don't even remember if I stamped it <br/>
with the stamps in the box.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm working on a series now (I LOVE that idea!), and soon (I <br/>
use the term loosely) southern Colorado will be a letterboxing hotspot. <br/>
Thanks in advance for any tips you can give to help me place "great" <br/>
boxes.<br/>

IMHO, these qualities would deem a 'great letterbox':<br/>
<br/>
-interesting &amp; a tad bit challenging clues<br/>
-nice stamp (I like interesting &amp; unique containers, too)<br/>
-beautiful or historically significant location<br/>
<br/>
Go forth &amp; multiply!!!  ;)  Happy New Year &amp; welcome to letterboxing!<br/>
