Name of letterbox:  Prairie Rose<br/>
My name: P. Granola (p2jd@aol.com)<br/>
Date Placed: 4-13-03<br/>
Placed in honor of the restored prairie effort at Willowbrook Wildlife Center<br/>
Difficulty: Easy<br/>
State: Illinois<br/>
County: Dupage<br/>
City:  Glen Ellyn<br/>
Location:  Willowbrook Wildlife Center<br/>
Directions: A few Miles West of 355 on Roosevelt Rd (route 38). Take <br/>
Roosevelt road to Park Blvd.  Turn South onto Park Blvd., travel about 3 <br/>
miles.  Willowbrook Wildlife Center is located on the West side of the <br/>
street; there is a brown sign at the entrance. <br/>
History:  The Willowbrook Wildlife Center is a part of the DuPage County Fores<br/>
t Preserve District.  Primarily it is a center for the care and <br/>
rehabilitation of injured wildlife.  There are indoor and outdoor displays of <br/>
animals that are too damaged to be released into the wild but well enough not <br/>
to be euthanized. The center is a great family attraction.  Make sure you <br/>
visit indoors and then look around outside at the Koi pond, prairie garden <br/>
and wild animals.<br/>
Behind the nature center there are hiking trails that take the visitor <br/>
through a variety of ecosystems (deciduous forest, savannah, pond &amp; prairie) <br/>
Clues: After you have toured the center and wandered around outside, make <br/>
your way to the path that reads "nature trails" (It's located between the red <br/>
tailed hawks and passenger pigeons cages).  If you would like you can take a <br/>
trail map out of the mailbox located to the right.  (Just make sure to put <br/>
the map back when you are done.)  Cross the bridge and you will come to a <br/>
fork in the road.  Turn left and begin walking.  The DuPage River will be on <br/>
your left and the savannah will be on your right. Continue walking and be <br/>
sure to read the interpretive signs along the way.  You will walk in a loop, <br/>
as you travel the savannah will turn into prairie.  Read the signs carefully. <br/>
 When you see the sign that says" Restoration and Management" you will want <br/>
to stop. In front of the sign there will be beautiful prairie, if you look to <br/>
your left you will see Muskrat Pond.  You will want to look to your right and <br/>
retrace your steps by about twenty paces.  There will be a tiny path on your <br/>
right that you can take.  You will see a bench, you might want to stop and <br/>
rest for a while!  From the end of the bench you will continue to walk about <br/>
20 paces. Stop and look to your left, (if you pass the two stands of trees <br/>
with the woodpile in between them you have gone too far.) Now look into the <br/>
woods on your left, start walking, and look for the tree whose roots look <br/>
like a spider.  Walk over the three thick roots and stop.  If you have a <br/>
compass you will want to look about 60 degrees to the East. (If you don't <br/>
have a compass look ahead and slightly to the right.)  You will see a large <br/>
tree with a smaller one that has fallen over next to it.  The smaller tree <br/>
looks like a bent elbow. Travel to those trees and look for the Prairie Rose <br/>
box.  Happy hunting!!<br/>
Caution: Watch out! There is poison ivy in the woods but none noted where the <br/>
box was placed<br/>
