Point Defiance Park box placed May 21, 2001<br/>
<br/>
Your journey starts at Point Defiance Park located in Tacoma, Washington.<br/>
The only time you will need to leave the trail is to recover the Letterbox,<br/>
last 3 clues. Please respect the park and leave with more trash than you<br/>
arrived with. You will want to enter the park on Pearl Street. Follow the<br/>
signs to 5-mile drive and look for the Gig Harbor Viewpoint. This is your<br/>
starting point. Enjoy your walk.fairly easy good paths, takes an hour or<br/>
less to find. Okay, I'm winging it! I have found one box and this is the<br/>
first one I have hidden. Good Luck!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Let the crosswalk be your guide - from its center choose your direction and<br/>
start walking.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the second circle and square and continue your walk there.<br/>
<br/>
At the circle 210 degrees is best then.<br/>
<br/>
Stay square and off the road.<br/>
<br/>
A square and a triangle show the way.<br/>
<br/>
Don't be square!<br/>
<br/>
100 degrees<br/>
<br/>
Two triangles?  Head east.<br/>
<br/>
Left 10 or 20 paces left.<br/>
<br/>
If you are headed near North when the trail ends, circle square is your next<br/>
80 degrees<br/>
<br/>
When ahead is a circle a square a triangle 220 is your course<br/>
<br/>
Two pair of red squares, ignore the first<br/>
