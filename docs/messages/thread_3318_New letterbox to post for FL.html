now, and asked that the following be forwarded to this site for posting, in <br/>
his absence for awhile.   It should be placed under Spike's Letterboxes, FL <br/>
series.   (See 'BOK Tower,'  etc., in Central FL area).   Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we are traveling to Devon, Eng. in a week.  How might we locate some <br/>
clues for this founding territory!?   Yes, I know we might ask in pubs, but, <br/>
any other leads?   <br/>

Florida Holiday Series   #3 -  “FLAPJACK”<br/>
<br/>
Location: DeLeon Springs State Recreation Area, west central Florida, north <br/>
of Orlando and Titusville, west of Daytona area. <br/>
Placed:     01 September 2001 by <a href="mailto:sandispike@aol.com">Sound <br/>
Directions</a> (<a href="mailto:sandispike@aol.com">Sandi</a> and <a <br="">
HREF="mailto:dougspike@aol.com"&gt;Doug Spike</a>)<br/>
<br/>
Rated: Easy; one-half mile walk through Nature Trail.  <br/>
<br/>
What a fun park site!  Grab the whole family and drive to DeLeon Springs, FL. <br/>
 The State Recreation area has lots to do for a partial day, or most of a <br/>
full day.  The real tourist highlight is the Griddle House with its <br/>
specialty: grilling your own pancakes and other breakfast foods with your own <br/>
choices of special ingredients and toppings.  Yum!  They serve until <br/>
mid-afternoons, but the weekends are very busy.  Go early!  Or, you may wish <br/>
to make your meal reservation, and hunt for “Flapjack” letterbox while <br/>
waiting for your table!  Other things to do: check out the old Sugar Mill, <br/>
canoeing, kayaking, paddleboats, swimming in the natural spring waterhole, <br/>
boat ramp, <a href="http://www.safaririvertours.com">scenic tour boat trips<br/>
</a>, and a short nature trail.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to DeLeon Springs: Follow I-4 to exit 56.  West on Hwy. 44 to Hwy <br/>
17/92 North.  Passing north of DeLand, watch for Ponce DeLeon Blvd. off U.S. <br/>
Hwy 17/92. (A Texaco gas station will be on your right). Turn west, and <br/>
follow signs for parking in the Park.  Information: (904) 985-4212.  A <br/>
property map should be given to you when talking with the parking attendant. <br/>
State Park fee is about $4.00 per car.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to “Flapjack”: Using your map, (or by asking directions), enter <br/>
the nature trail that meanders through a floodplain forest.  (Mosquitoes <br/>
galore in the shaded areas!  Use repellent and hurry!)   You will need to <br/>
find “Old Methuselah.”  Once you are close to him, at the railing, look <br/>
under the wooden bench on your left.  Voila!  “Flapjack” lurks.  Please <br/>
discretely stamp and return him to his home.  Thank you.    Enjoy the rest of <br/>
the nature path, and your pancake breakfast or other goodies made from their <br/>
oven-baked, natural grain products.  <br/>
