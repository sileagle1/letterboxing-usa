                    <div class="plaintext-content">Private land always puts me off, unless the clues specifically say "This person is cool and knows about us and likes us wierdos".  I saw a small hole dug (deep is bad) that was well done to make the covering rock look flush with the earth, but the area must have very, very good drainage!  I can't emphasize enough how many LBs I've found floating.  The crotch of a tree's branches can also fill up with water.  Logs disintegrate, so pack the area with smaller stones to lift the box up (for drainage).  Cover well with the stuff that's natural to the area.  If using an old log and there's slabs of bark around already loose, then that can be good.  Don't strip bark off of trees or break branches off!  Besides hurting the environment, branches will become dead-looking and stand out.<br/>
