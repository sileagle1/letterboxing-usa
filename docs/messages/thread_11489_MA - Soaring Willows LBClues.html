This is a Drew Clan letterbox, so Jay, I'm trying to do another one <br/>
of those "random acts of letterboxing kindness" things again.<br/>
<br/>
Soaring Willows<br/>
<br/>
Hike:  Easy Strolling in well marked woods.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Purposefully vague to encourage exploring this lovely area.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  A single letterbox at the Caratunk Wildlife Refuge in <br/>
Seekonk, MA.  Just east of Providence, RI, and the MA-RI border, take <br/>
Exit 1 from I-195.*  Follow Route 114A north for 3 miles and turn <br/>
right onto Newman Avenue (Route 152) for 2.2 miles.  Watch for Route <br/>
152 to break left at a fork and follow it.  Turn right on Brown <br/>
Avenue at the Ledgemont Country Club sign.  The refuge entrance is on <br/>
the right past the country club.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing:  At the stone wall just south-southwest of the Hemlock <br/>
Loop intersection, take 13 lucky steps northwest and look in the <br/>
eastern face.<br/>
<br/>
(This web page was accompanied by a trail map.  If you want me to <br/>
scan the trail map and send it to you, please email me at <br/>
warrioringilead@yahoo.com.)<br/>
<br/>
*Please note that I-195 starts in Providence, RI, branching east off <br/>
Route I-95, and continues into Seekonk, MA and beyond.  The Exit 1 <br/>
you are looking for is the Exit 1 *after* you pass the MA border.  If <br/>
you get off at the first Exit 1 you see, you will wind up in downtown <br/>
Providence.  Just a friendly note.  Warrior Woman <br/>
