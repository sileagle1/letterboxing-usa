able to find the article you mentioned.  Peanut and I will be moving<br/>
to western Wisconsin in a couple of months.  There seems to be quite a<br/>
shortage of boxes in that part of the state.  We plan on planting some<br/>
of our own, but also want to do what we can to spread the word about<br/>
Letterboxing.  We are hoping to try to get the local papers<br/>
(Minneapolis Star Tribune and St. Paul Pioneer) to do articles about<br/>
Letterboxing.  After the Washington Post did it's article last June,<br/>
it really took off in this area.  We hope we can duplicate that event<br/>
in the twin cities and western Wisconsin.  <br/>

Let us also add our welcome.  I am interested to know where I might be<br/>
able to find the article you mentioned.  Peanut and I will be moving<br/>
to western Wisconsin in a couple of months.  There seems to be quite a<br/>
shortage of boxes in that part of the state.  We plan on planting some<br/>
of our own, but also want to do what we can to spread the word about<br/>
Letterboxing.  We are hoping to try to get the local papers<br/>
(Minneapolis Star Tribune and St. Paul Pioneer) to do articles about<br/>
Letterboxing.  After the Washington Post did it's article last June,<br/>
it really took off in this area.  We hope we can duplicate that event<br/>
in the twin cities and western Wisconsin.<br/>

Hunting down a craze<br/>
You have to be careful not to fall into the lake or get run over while<br/>
looking for it, according to the instructions. You have to do math and must<br/>
be able to keep a secret.<br/>
<br/>
All of this is required to find the "Calatrava/Green One" letterboxes - two<br/>
hidden, waterproof boxes with blank books inside that people hunt down with<br/>
elaborate clues. Once they find the boxes, people put rubber stamps in the<br/>
book. It's part of a national underground hobby craze called letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
For the "Calatrava/Green One" box, you have to count the number of cables in<br/>
the Santiago Calatrava-designed pedestrian bridge at the Milwaukee Art<br/>
Museum, add it to the number of nearby flag poles and walk that many paces<br/>
north along a breakwater to find another clue.<br/>
<br/>
Clues for boxes nationally (including 15 in Milwaukee) are at<br/>
www.letterboxing.org.<br/>
