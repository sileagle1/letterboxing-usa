<br/>
This is an all-call to anyone who would like to carve a stamp / make <br/>
a box for my Bachelorette Party Gathering on 12 May.  The theme is <br/>
love/marriage/dating/engagement/divorce/etc.  So, anything at all <br/>
that has to do with that theme would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you live close, then you obviously have more control over <br/>
what happens to your box after the gathering.  But, if you live far <br/>
away, then there are two ways you can do it:<br/>
<br/>
1) You can send me the stamp/box and after the gathering, I will find <br/>
it a permanent home here in upstate NY.  And, if you like, I will <br/>
maintain it for you, but give you ownership so you can have an out-of-<br/>
state plant on your tally.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
or 2) You can send me the stamp/box and after the gathering, I will <br/>
simply mail it back to you.  So, you can do this for event stamps or <br/>
postals and such... or traditionals that you just feel like launching <br/>
out here to NY for a bit.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, thanks in advance for your thoughts and contributions!!!!<br/>

take care,<br/>

Also, where do you want it sent?  I should tell you that I am new to <br/>
