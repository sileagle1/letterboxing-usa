Would you like to see the Hollywood Sign up close, from behind? Well, <br/>
this isn't it. Check out the Mt. Lee letterbox for that. This hike <br/>
takes you through dusty chaparral in the Hollywood Hills.<br/>
<br/>
Enter Griffith Park by the Greek Theater, and park at the Bird <br/>
Sanctuary, just before the road curves to the left and begins going <br/>
uphill. Enter the forested Bird Sanctuary and find the path on the <br/>
left side that goes uphill along a fence. Follow this path uphill <br/>
until the trail widens into a dirt "platform." On the rare clear day, <br/>
you will be able to see the city of Los Angeles spread out below you. <br/>
Find a path to your right that goes uphill. You will know you are on <br/>
the correct path if you can find a small pipe that comes out of the <br/>
ground and crosses the trail, just high enough to trip you. Keep <br/>
going. You will then come to a larger pipe that goes uphill. But stay <br/>
on the path for a short while, and the path will come to a junction <br/>
of sorts, with the pipe now downhill to your right. You want to go <br/>
left. From this point, count 40 single-step paces and you will see a <br/>
large shrub on the left side of the trail. It stands taller than most <br/>
of the surrounding shrubs. Walk around to the left side of this <br/>
shrub, the side farthest from the path. You will find what you seek <br/>
under a medium-sized boulder. Either go back the way you came, or <br/>
continue ever upwards to the top of Mount Hollywood, with spectacular <br/>
views both the San Fernando Valley and the L.A. Basin.<br/>
