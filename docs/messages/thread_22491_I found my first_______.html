This is a real red letter day.  A friend and I went out this morning and<br/>

navigational skills weren't&gt; and we found the right area without any trouble<br/>
   Had a refresher course in compass reading last night as when we used to<br/>
go hiking my husband always did the navigating.  <he better="" knew="" let<br="" than="" to="">

very useful for prodding around ground cover, leaves and branches without<br/>
reaching in.   Now I really can't wait for my trip to Connecticut and Maine<br/>
next month.  I've told my friends that I'll be visiting about it and they're<br/>

You're going to CT? You know about letterboxing in the Mansfield area, don't <br/>
you? If not, contact me off list for a clue!<br/>

I've told my friends about boxing and they're very interested in it so I'm sure we'll spend lots of time looking for boxes.  My friends were amazed to find out how many were right in their own town!!    I'm already reassembling my daypack with all the essentials after many years of non-use and have started a checklist from all the great ideas on this group.     I'm making a list of boxes in the area.  We'll make sure to look for some of yours if they are in the general area of Boothbay Harbor.  <br/>
