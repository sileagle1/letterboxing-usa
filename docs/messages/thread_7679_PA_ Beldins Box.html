I was so exited I found it tonight and I've added this onto <br/>
the story:<br/>
<br/>
Beldins twin drifted into a dreamy sleep. He drempt an old grumpy<br/>
gnome walking along the lake and into the woods towards where he<br/>
slept. The gnome looked down upon him and uttered ...<br/>
<br/>
How dare you enter my private home<br/>
May your flesh and blood be turned into stone<br/>
<br/>
"Oh my!", gasped Beldin. "This is much more than a dream, isn't<br/>
it". Good thing for me, I don't really need my flesh and blood<br/>
all that much. my better half has plenty to spare. I'll just make<br/>
do as a spirit for a while.<br/>
<br/>
His spirit drifted up and floated by the confused and even more<br/>
grumpy gnome. He noticed a cuckoo bird with something in its beak<br/>
perched on a old rotted log about 30 paces away, slightly west of<br/>
north.<br/>
<br/>
"A kindred spirit", he thought, as he merged his spirit with the<br/>
bird, and lay down there to get some much needed sleep.<br/>
