                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was wondering today, as I worked on the database program, why we do things the way that we do? In example, most of the people that I have met thus far letterboxing could be described as the Renaissance type of person. The ones that build things with their hands and are proud of it. On the other hand the majority of the Geocachers strike me as Technogeeks that are more interested in using their technogadgets then in creating something from hand......<br/>
<br/>
Of course, each is in their own right to do what they want, no? However, I remember one simple precept. <br/>
<br/>
"Do what you will, ere it harm none." <br/>
<br/>
I've found that the letterboxing crowd, is, for the most part, a more laid back crowd, more aware of their surroundings and how they affect them, than the Geocaching crowd appears to be. <br/>
<br/>
I know that we both claim the same 'care of the surroundings' and all, but I'm sorry, I've seen the vegetation surrounding the few Geocaches I have stumbled across, and let me tell you, it is a sorry sight. Of course, we end up with the inevitable 'social' trail leading towards our boxes, specially if it is a more frequented box, but, I for one do everything I can to ensure that the land is better off than when I came there. We, Team Rayvenhaus, even go so far as to have the kids carry plastic shopping bags, you know, the ones that we get from the grocery store, with them and RayvenDad gives them a dollar a bag for every bag of trash they carry out of a park, trail or forest. <br/>
<br/>
Let me share two stories with you. The first one is the day that team Rayvenhaus went to walk through the area where our Snow Dogs series is planted. AS we wandered through the forest trails, the kids were gleefully picking up every scrap of litter they could find. Imagine, if you will, the site we made as we emerged from the forest 4 hours later, the RayvenTwins each carrying 3 bags apiece, stuffed full of garbage, RayvenMom carrying the remnants of some 4 different blankets and other assorted cloth items and RayvenDad rolling two tires, one small trailer sized tire complete with rim and one MudStomping, huge treaded monstrosity. As we approached the garbage can, I realized from the fact that it was overflowing with McDonalds bags on the ground and other various trash spread in a 6 foot circle, what we had was not going to fit into the can. So, off we went, loading up the back of the RayvenVan (A highly specialized and modified, Top Secret vehicle designed specifically for letterbox adventures and picnics.... Much like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!) and then returned to the area around the garbage can and proceeded to clean that area up. After about 5 minutes of work I noticed a man approaching from the recreation building with a purposeful stride. I told the family to continue and turned to greet the man. Imagine my surprise at his questions as to why we were stealing the garbage!!!! I am sure that my chin hit the ground when he asked that. A rather interesting conversation ensued as we talked about what we were doing there and why we were doing the groundskeeper's job. When asked that question, I responded with a simple statement, "Well, it looks to me that the groundskeeper isn't doing it, so we thought we'd help." After speaking with the man, it was obvious that he was unprepared for anyone to wander the forest and clean it as they went, that he was more used to people leaving their trash behind that in people picking up others trash. He then pointed to two large dumpsters and said that we were welcome to place the garbage there rather than mess up the vehicle by trying to cart it off ourselves. The man left with an assuredly better outlook on people using the facilities than he had that morning. <br/>
<br/>
The second story concerns meeting some Geocachers on the trail. We had just completed a series of three near DuPont, Wa when, on the return, we came across a group of 4 people, blundering around in the underbrush on both sides of the trail, yelling and hollering about "Where in the ^&amp;%$ is the &amp;*$@*!&amp; thing supposed to be.", etc, etc, etc. We stopped and watched for almost 5 minutes before anyone noticed that we were there, watching as the undergrowth was trampled and literally torn up as they poked and prodded and ripped and torn their way towards locating something. Not one to jump to conclusions, I offered to help then locate whatever it was that they had lost. One of the people returned to the trail to converse with me as the rest of the group continued on the pillage and plunder routine in the underbrush. The person spoke to me, telling me of this wonderful sport they were participating in, called Geocaching, and explained how it worked and what they were trying to find. I enquired if their sport also included destroying the surrounding vegetation whilst searching for the illusive cache. The look of incomprehension on his face made it painfully clear that the jab went unnoticed. We stood there until one of the people in the underbrush shrieked in glee as the unearthed the Geocache. And I mean unearthed as in dug it up. After they had concluded their business and departed, we stood there and surveyed the damage that had been done to the area and, all I can say is that I was reminded of that commercial in the late 1970's of the Native American standing by a Highway, looking over the pollution with a single tear running down his cheek. <br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, I am not saying that all people who letterbox take care of the environment, nor am I saying that all people who geocache destroy the environment. All I am saying is that one bad apple ruins the barrel, one awwcrappie, wipes out all your attaboys, books are judged by their covers, etc, etc. <br/>
<br/>
And I am saying that everyone one of us Letterboxes need to ensure that we leave a place better than when we found it, that we do everything in our power to be cognitive of our surroundings and take care of what little is left of nature's gift to us. It is, after all, fast disappearing. The one thing to remember is a line from the movie The Matrix..... <br/>
<br/>
Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment. But you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You are a plague. <br/>
<br/>
Kinda interesting when you think about it.... Because it is true. We are destroying that which we have and not replacing it. We only get one shot. <br/>
<br/>
I hope that the rantings of this article have not upset anyone, nor caused anyone to think that I am looking down upon them, as I fall into that same group as you do. Human beings. And I am no better than anyone else on this website. My intent in writing this was to perhaps, foster some thoughts about helping to make a location better than when we entered it, to help cleanup the planet one spot at a time. <br/>
<br/>
Until next time. Be well and may you find every box you look for. <br/>

to make your world better than you found it.  The Lord knows the <br/>
world could use more like you!  I am a little troubled by the <br/>
philisophical implications of your quote from the matrix.<br/>
<br/>

]Having always had a somewhat conservationist bent, I joined the <br/>
Sierra Club several years ago.  Reading their publications for a few <br/>
months, I discovered they have much the same view of humans as the <br/>
Matrix writer and I did not renew my membership.  As a Christian, I <br/>
found this view to be totally incompatible with the Biblical view of <br/>
things.  Scripture teaches that mankind is the highest form of <br/>
created thing on the Earth, having been made in the image of God <br/>
Himself, and was given dominion over everything on the Earth to use <br/>
and care for it.  So the Bible says we are caretakers or stewards of <br/>
the Earth and everything in it for it's rightful owner - the Creator, <br/>
God.  As someone made in the image of almighty God, I take offense to <br/>
being regarded as a 'virus.'  Please note that I am not taking <br/>
offense at you personally - only the idea embodied in the quote.  I <br/>
don't know if you are a Christian or not but I hope I have not <br/>
offended you in any way.  Have a great day and happy boxing!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Kudos to you for trash pickup! Can't tell you how many things we pick up as we hike. Yuck. The stuff people leave behind. I just last week introduced my cousin to the sport of letterboxing. She loved it even though we didn't find the box we were looking for. This was the Christmas box down in Florida. They've had a lot of rain lately and part of the trail was under water so we couldn't get to it.  In turn she and her boyfriend took me geocaching. This was fun and somewhat different to what I'm used to. We had an involved discussion regarding leaving things better than you found them. And, to my delight, we were in agreement. I think the key is education about the environment around us. That being careful where you step is important. And I'm glad you said something to the folks who were thrashing about in the underbrush. Geocachers, letterboxers, hikers....whatever need to learn to respect nature and all our surroundings. <br/>

<br/>
In a nutshell Bigguy, I'll say this much. Whether or not I am a Christian is<br/>
of no importance.  The teachings you shared are very true.  However, the<br/>
lines from the Matrix and the writings of the Sierra Club bear one thing in<br/>
mind.... The majority of the people on this planet are not stewards of<br/>
nature's riches, they are more the thief with the key.  They rape, pillage<br/>
and plunder.  I don't mean to drag this into a deep philosophical discussion<br/>
on the mailing list (Feel free to contact me offlist if you'd like) but the<br/>
bottom line is that, no matter what your beliefs, the majority of people<br/>
just don't care.  And that is evedanced by the damage that both Geocachers<br/>
and, to a lesser extent in my opinion, Letterboxers do to the countryside<br/>
when placing or searching.<br/>
<br/>
I don't mean to indicate that I think everyone is this way, but it's not the<br/>
hundreds of good stories that we hear, it's the single bad story that makes<br/>
the headlines.  For example, nothing would be written about the thousands of<br/>
safe and sane searches that took place during any given timeframe, but, let<br/>
one person drop a cigarette into the underbrush while letterboxing and BAM!<br/>
Headlines around the country would read "Forest fire rages out of control<br/>
after Letterbox arsonist ignites the conflagration." Same thing for a<br/>
Geocacher.<br/>
<br/>
Which is what started me on this because of the damage that I see others do,<br/>
whichever hobby they follow.<br/>
<br/>
That's all.  (grin)<br/>

when you clean the trails.  Something like being "salt and light" in <br/>
the world in my humble opinion.  Keep up the good work!<br/>

Also, my personal stamp (Tom and I use a different one as our family stamp) is the same as yours and Kris's. Maybe I ought to use a different one! ;)<br/>

The traveler is a box that travels from event to event with someone.  And<br/>
thanks for noticing the PNL count, that's one of the reasons that we started<br/>
this.  As far as the stamp, don't worry, I am just now finishing up carving<br/>
a new stamp for the family.  (grin)<br/>
