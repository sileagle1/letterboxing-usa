Many  months ago, we picked up a clue sheet at the Waterford, CT EMS store for something called W.M.S. 6 Green Letterboxing Adventure in Goodwin State Forest.  Turns out it is incomplete and ends with your journey is only beginning - more on full pamphlet.No one at EMS seems to know where the rest of the write-up is (weve asked several times).  Is there anyone out there who knows anything about this write-up?  Or perhaps the author can fill us in on what happens next?  <br/>
<br/>
We would really like to get the rest of the information for this adventure.<br/>

        I have a copy of the 6 Green Letterbox clues.  I also got the clues<br/>
from EMS, but got the full pamphlet.  The rest of the clues are 3 pages<br/>
long, but if you want we could make you a copy, or fax you a copy.  Let me<br/>
know what would work for you.  Or maybe we will see you at the fair this<br/>
weekend and could give you a copy!<br/>
