and I was gonna post her whereabouts when we returned. Imagine my <br/>
surprize to see the John Kerry post. I thought it odd and went to <br/>
check on the box I left Rosie in and sure enough she was gone and in <br/>
her place a John Kerry stamp in the log book. Hand carved too. It is <br/>
a "negative image" stamp, but heck, pretty good for a first stamp! <br/>
Even odder was that I had left Rosie in a local word of mouth box, <br/>
knowing that a few folks were planning to try to nab it soon. Who <br/>
would have thought Kerry would stumble on a WOM clue? I guess folks <br/>
in high places have good resources!<br/>
