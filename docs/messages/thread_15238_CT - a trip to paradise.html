(and mom, of course) right by my side?!!  Such was the feeling when we found <br/>
the Letterboxers Paradise box.  So much rubber, so little time!  I found out <br/>
later that this store is so well known that my mother-in-law travels from <br/>
Northern NJ to shop there.  OK-- so a store full of great stuff, my mom's <br/>
credit card AND my mother-in-law's credit card probably could have topped it <br/>
all -- but, why be greedy?!<br/>
<br/>
While I stamped into the box, Miss Ma ran all over the store ferrying her <br/>
various and sundry objects of desire to the counter.  Be takes a completely <br/>
different tact, examining everything and weighing all his options before <br/>
choosing the exact and perfect item.  I don't know which method is harder to <br/>
deal with...<br/>
<br/>
I tried to explain letterboxing to my mom (again).  She doesn't really like <br/>
to go into the woods anymore (can't blame her for that -- once mosquito <br/>
bitten and West Niled and all that!)  I can't say that she "got it", but, <br/>
being a mom, she smiled brightly and said "what ever makes you happy!..."  <br/>
Then, she whipped out her credit card and treated the kids to some goodies.  <br/>
By that time, I had put back most of Madeleine's booty except for a punch or <br/>
two and a gel pen.   I knew we had lots more stores to go to with Grandma <br/>
and this would only be the tip of the present iceberg (more stuff to weigh <br/>
down the suitcases and be left all over the kitchen!)<br/>
<br/>
As far as purchases of my own -- I really had to restrain myself (and with <br/>
Mom's credit card at the ready -- that was a Herculean task -- having been <br/>
trained at birth to take advantage of the plastic when ever it was offered <br/>
-- come on -- it makes her so happy!!)  All the stamping stuff looked great <br/>
-- especially since I have just stumbled on to this card making/stamping <br/>
mania myself.  But, having recently signed up to be a demonstrator for <br/>
Stampin Up (business attempt 418 -- I think) I needed to channel all my <br/>
goody seeking through my own sales.  As I tell Da -- don't think of it as <br/>
another attempt to make money, but, more as a continual 20% off coupon on <br/>
what I would undoubtedly spend at Michaels!  :-)  Warning to those who own <br/>
Michael's stock -- sell now -- business will be diving!...<br/>
<br/>
I was really hoping to make an exchange or two at the Great American Stamp <br/>
Store.  I mentioned the letterbox, I talked loudly (ok -- so I do that all <br/>
the time...)  but, no luck!  Oh well, I will just have to content myself <br/>
with a wonderful stamp, a fun outing with my mom and more "artistic <br/>
snippets" for the kids (time to put the leaf in the kitchen table...)  BeMa<br/>
