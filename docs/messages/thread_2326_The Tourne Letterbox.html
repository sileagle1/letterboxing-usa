Tourne County Park<br/>
Placed 05/09/01 by Wingfoot<br/>
Boonton and Denville, Morris County, New Jersey<br/>
<br/>
Clues:      Easy<br/>
Terrain:          Fairly Easy<br/>
<br/>
Traveling NORTH on 287, take Exit 43 for Intervale Road (Mountain Lakes). At <br/>
the end of the ramp turn LEFT and cross over I-287 to the traffic light. Turn <br/>
RIGHT at the light onto Fanny Road. Proceed straight to the second stop sign. <br/>
Turn RIGHT onto West Main Street. Bear LEFT at the "Y" onto Powerville Road. <br/>
Continue until the first road on the left, McCaffrey Lane. Turn LEFT. A sign <br/>
for Tourne Park marks the entrance. <br/>
<br/>
Early Dutch settlers named this land "Torren", which means tower.  <br/>
<br/>
The highlight of a trip to Tourne Park continues to be the view from the top. <br/>
<br/>
The Tourne is the only remaining undeveloped fragment of the Great Boonton <br/>
Tract, purchased by David Ogden, Colonial Attorney-General of New Jersey in <br/>
1759. McCaffrey Lane, which serves as the main entrance to the park, was <br/>
created in 1767 by Samuel Ogden to haul iron ore from Hibernia's mines to his <br/>
iron works in Old Boonton. Within this historic region, the Continental Army <br/>
manufactured cannon balls for use during the American Revolution.<br/>
<br/>
Please be discreet, as this is a heavily traveled area. <br/>
<br/>
Start at the baseball field parking lot.<br/>
Look for signs directing you to the scenic overlook.<br/>
Take and stay on trail to the top.<br/>
There are several viewing areas at the top of The Tourne. <br/>
You will need to figure out from which vantage point you can see the top of <br/>
the Manhatten skyline.    <br/>
There is a small wooden bench there.<br/>
