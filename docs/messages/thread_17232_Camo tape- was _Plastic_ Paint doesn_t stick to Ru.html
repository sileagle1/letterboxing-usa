                    <div class="plaintext-content">I use camo on my boxes to help them blend into the forest better. It has been helpful when the container isn't quite fully covered or like in the case of my "the Truth" box which I found exposed near it's hiding place - exchanged for an acorn! :-) I hide my boxes very near the trail edges. The cloth camo tape makes the boxes nearly invisible against a natural background of leaves, twigs and other forest ground clutter, but I always try to cover them with a rock or two as well. It's meant for covering bow and gun stocks and can be found in most sporting goods stores and hunting depts. (I even found it in Walmart in Indiana, but not in the city Walmarts). If you plan to try it, be sure it's cloth tape and not the plastic (like camo duct tape) because the shine on the plastic sticks out like a sore thumb! Thank-you to Franzsolo who started the camo trend here in the tri-state :-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I also use camo tape.  The pattern doesn't seem to matter as <br/>
long as the overall colour is close.  The idea is to break up the <br/>
sharp outlines of the box (there are no straight line in nature) and <br/>
hide any bright colour on the box.  It is quite amazing to see for <br/>
oneself how much of a difference this makes.  <br/>
