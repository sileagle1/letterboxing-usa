It is really sad for me to lose my Geocities site, mainly because of all the memories.  I first set up my letterboxing site to post the clues to my first placed box back in 2002.  Back then, you could not post clues directly on LBNA, you had to email them to a webmaster who then posted them in the correct state and county.  Needless to say it was a slow process.  Can you imagine doing it that way now?  Anyway, I decided to create my own site and learned enough HTML to post clues myself so my brother Baby Bear would not have to wait for them to be posted on LBNA.  I had fun playing with the site and soon had pictures, links and other things to go along with my clues.  I have created a new site with a different host to house these things, but my clues have been placed directly on LBNA so I won't have to move them again.  I know things are better for the most part now, but I find myself missing the old days sometimes.<br/>

As you mentioned, there was ample warning for folks using GeoCities and all the boxes on LbNA and AQ were switched over before the deadline. There were one or two boxers who didn't respond so at the last minute those boxes just sorta "moved" on their own.<br/>

Mark is right though, another piece of letterboxing history gone. I think the best backup is still good old paper...<br/>
