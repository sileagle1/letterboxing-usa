  Just Curious, Which type of GPS do you like? What kind do you use in your<br/>
  tracking?  Do you think LB clues and geocaching go together?  <br/>
           Carrying around a GPS is kind of like having a camera when<br/>
  others that are around don't know what you are up to.   Kind of makes you<br/>
  look like you are "on a mission"  and everything is ok. What do you<br/>
  think?<br/>

We use a Magellan meridian Platinum (the B&amp;W)- if your looking to <br/>
buy check out the web (Amazon) they are cheaper and more variety<br/>

I use the very inexpensive Garmin Geko 101.  It is a little under <br/>
$100 and you can even find them at Walmart in the sporting goods <br/>
section. (I think it runs $96 at Walmart)  I am sure there are better <br/>
ones out there-- however, you can't beat this one for the price.<br/>
My only negative comment is that it does not have the ability to <br/>
download waypoints.  (you have to enter all the waypoints yourself)<br/>
All other Garmin products have this feature.  However, I haven't <br/>
found this to be a problem.  I usually print out my sheets and take <br/>
them with me.  Then I type them in one at a time as I begin a search <br/>
for a particular cache.<br/>
It's a great product at a great price!<br/>
