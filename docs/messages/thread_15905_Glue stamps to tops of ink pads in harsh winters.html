I actually glue my stamps to a small wooden block.  In most cases a<br/>
2"x2"x1/8" which I currently buy from the local craft store, but will be<br/>
making i the near future as soon as I get my wood shop up and running. I<br/>
find it gives the stamp a good solid back and helps keep fingers and such<br/>
clean.  I use a glue called "GOOP" which I discovered in Walgreen. It was<br/>
the only thing that I could use to attach the "This is a letterbox" sheet<br/>
that I had made. Tape wouldn't stick to the box I had decided to use,<br/>
nothing. Then Goop and it's stuck now!  (grin)  We'll see how they survive<br/>
their first winter and I'll let everyone know.<br/>

Oh, now you've got me ... what in the ... what are the boxes made of????<br/>
<br/>
As for the goop, I've used that to attach my personal stamp [about 2"<br/>
square] on plexi which is much easier to cut than wood. And slowly the<br/>
rubber is working it's way off the plexi.  I think I didn't rough the<br/>
plexi up enough before the glue.  Next time the plexi will get some<br/>
deep groves around the edges to prevent the stamp from going off.<br/>

Simple Rubbermaid brand sandwich boxes... The surface as a ver slick feel to<br/>
it and the tape would not stick when twisted or moved.  However, Gooping it<br/>
down, worked perfectly.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;snip....Tape wouldn't stick to the box I had decided to use,...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, now you've got me ... what in the ... what are the boxes made of????<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for the goop, I've used that to attach my personal stamp [about 2"<br/>
&gt; square] on plexi which is much easier to cut than wood. And slowly the<br/>
&gt; rubber is working it's way off the plexi.  I think I didn't rough the<br/>
&gt; plexi up enough before the glue.  Next time the plexi will get some<br/>
&gt; deep groves around the edges to prevent the stamp from going off.<br/>

the lids, but now  that you mention it they do have a 'greasy' surface<br/>
to them.  I was running all sorts of weird containers thru my mind,<br/>
and knowing you are an ex-military man some of them were getting<br/>
pretty exotic!<br/>

&gt; Simple Rubbermaid brand sandwich boxes... The surface as a ver slick<br/>
feel to<br/>
&gt; it and the tape would not stick when twisted or moved.  However,<br/>
Gooping it<br/>
&gt; down, worked perfectly.<br/>
