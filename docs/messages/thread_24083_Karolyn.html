I know can you believe how time flies!!? We are a bit more tame now than we<br/>
used to be huh? I know I am. I never thought I would settle down so much but<br/>
these kids just wear me out so much. *SMILE*  You know when I see Jay and<br/>
Kathy, they do not seem to be any different. They are still as nutty as ever<br/>
 I still have to try and Kathy interested in LBing. I think it would be fun<br/>
to LB with her the next time we go to Jax and see them. <br/>

Has it really been 15 years? Wow...let's not go back there! LOL The <br/>
Krystal I knew then is a bit different than the Krystal I know now! <br/>
I suppose the same could be said of me. Husbands and children will <br/>
tame a person...a tiny bit at least!<br/>
