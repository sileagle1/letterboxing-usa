<div>We went looking for our first letterbox today and 
were disappointed when it wasn't were it was supposed to be. It's the one 
described at <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/ma/adamsmil.htm">http://www.letterboxing.org/ma/adamsmil.htm</a>. 
We found the tree fine (someone painted the number "420" on it), but there 
weren't any rocks or sticks anywhere nearby. Is this an effective way of letting 
the requestor knowing that things are awry? We'll try another set of clues next 
time. Thanks!</div></div></body></html>
