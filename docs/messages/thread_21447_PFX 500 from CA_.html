WOW!  - that didn't take long!  We were just hoping to hear from someone in a <br/>
"new state" reaching PFX 500 and here she is:  Princess Lea from CA who <br/>
reached that goal on Dec 24, 2004!  Most of her boxing was done out there, <br/>
too, although we also know from experience that she placed boxes in some <br/>
very interesting spots in Vermont when she came out this way to visit last <br/>
year!<br/>
<br/>
Way to go, Princess Lea, who has now joined the ranks of super west coast <br/>
"club members" Amanda from Seattle and Dvn2rckr from Dupont, WA!  Maybe <br/>
we should start adding state locations to the list so people can see this is just <br/>
not for CT anymore!  And maybe soon we can get a few other "high rollers" to <br/>
come out of their shells and be recognized for all their hard work, too!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Wanda and Pete<br/>
