Mother's Day. Here's my entry<br/>
<br/>
This being my first anniversary of my first FIND, and wanting to make it an <br/>
annual thing, I went Lbing with my daughter (17, rolling eyes, "Do I have <br/>
to?"  "YES, it's Mother's Day!")<br/>
<br/>
Had 4 print-outs in hand from Hikrgrlz, the Contra Costa Series. Drove 60 <br/>
miles before I noticed the first one on the list was a 1 mile hike each way <br/>
and daughter totally nixed that one. <br/>
<br/>
On to #2 where I took a wrong turn and found I was almost to #3 so, nixed #2. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On to #3, beautiful hike in a place 5 miles from where I grew up and lived 25 <br/>
years and never knew existed (but isn't that what Lbing is all about?) Short <br/>
hike, just about there, "at the edge of the meadow" yeah, I go to turn the <br/>
page and found I've left the second page of the instructions at home. <br/>
(Daughter rolls eyes TWICE!!) Okay, Okay, no giving up. Trees, look behind <br/>
the trees, that one, this one. FOUND IT!! Of course, it didn't hurt that it <br/>
was TOTALLY exposed!! (Hey people, cover them up when you're done!)<br/>
<br/>
On to #4, daughter sat in the car while I climbed to the top of a mountain <br/>
with an incredible view. If I had sat there the year I was born, there would <br/>
have been nothing to see in the way of buildings, schools, airports, etc, but <br/>
NOW. . . .WOW!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy with 2 new Lbs. Then to the mall (my daughter's 'carrot') and bound <br/>
some great bargains too! A totally awesome if a little unusual, Mother's Day!<br/>
