                    <div class="plaintext-content">So, after my frustration about the missing stamp, I decide the best <br/>
thing is to go find a box that has a stamp.  There is one in my to-do <br/>
file that is a few miles away so I pop over and strap the skis back <br/>
on.  I ski up to where it turns into a bushwhack, and after a bit of <br/>
wandering on foot, I figure out the clue twist and locate the box. <br/>
<br/>
It is in the crook of a tree and is snow-covered so I brush away the <br/>
snow and note it is iced in as well. I bang away at the ice until it <br/>
becomes apparent that ice is gone and I am now banging away at wood!  <br/>
The tree was growing around the box and had a darn good grip on it.  <br/>
I continue trying to free the box but the plastic is a lot softer <br/>
than oak and the box is obviously not going to come out in one piece.<br/>
<br/>
The box is on its side so I cannot even get the lid off.  I finally <br/>
pry one corner open and manage to pull out the stamp and log.  Here <br/>
are the entries:<br/>

Established: 09/13/2000<br/>
1st visit:   09/28/2000<br/>
2nd visit:   11/05/2000<br/>
3rd visit:   me!<br/>
<br/>
Fourteen months does not seem THAT long but it was the crook of a <br/>
large triple oak so the space was compressing at three times the <br/>
normal rate, I guess...<br/>
<br/>
I used one of the enclosed postcards to notify the planter.  I told <br/>
them I'll get a new container. Perhaps I'll place a rock larger than <br/>
the container underneath it during re-planting.<br/>
