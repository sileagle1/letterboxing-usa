...that the Road Rally was a SERIOUSLY awesome event??? Sorry we're<br/>
late with our praise, but after a much shortened trip how, the<br/>
Highlander is finally back polishing up his blade and I'm letting my<br/>
wings dry out and finally have time to say WOW! That totally rocked.<br/>
When are we doin' this AGAIN???<br/>
<br/>
An excellent job on what we hope is the first of many gatherings! The<br/>
Road RULES! :-D<br/>
