<br/>
Location: Mason Exit, Springdale, Ohio<br/>
<br/>
Address: Take OHIO US 42 South from I-275 about 4 miles, Park is on the Left.<br/>
<br/>
Level: 4 (Not REAL hard)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Need: Stamp Pad, Pen<br/>
<br/>
Clues: The Clues to this box are very small as Sharon Woods is a good place<br/>
to get lost in. This  trail is out of this world as far as looking down over a very quick running creak and some very nice falls. (You'll like it)<br/>
<br/>
 You will find the Richard H Durrell Gorge trail. The trail is Left of the Dam.  (If you never been here, It's not like a BIG dam) the road goes over it and you can't miss it.<br/>
<br/>
 You will walk along this trail for about 15 Mins UNLESS you stop off to check out the so cool views.<br/>
<br/>
  You will walk till you come upon a Green on your left hand side, Humm, maybe get a time?????  (that's why they made cell phones)<br/>
<br/>
 Not far after that you will cross the creek. BUT as Obi-Wan Kenobi would say  (YYYOOOOOU Don't WANT to cross the creek),  At the first post where the railing starts for the bridge, You want to take a reading of 320'  (I want to take reading of 320')   You will see a fallin tree about 6 paces (pace=2 Steps) into the side brush.  The letter box is in the middle and UNDER the tree.  (Just use those Jedi powers and LIFT that tree up)<br/>
<br/>
   May the force be with you<br/>
