<br/>
I was asked to create a special letterbox for the upcoming Great<br/>
Plains Geocaching Spring 2003 Cache Bash.  Geocachers will have to put<br/>
down their GPS units and use a compass and casual orienteering clues<br/>
to find this letterbox hidden near their June 7-8 meeting site in<br/>
Northeast Omaha.<br/>
<br/>
The clues have been posted online at the Letterboxing Nebraska web<br/>
site at: <br/>
<br/>
http://interbug.com/letterboxing<br/>
<br/>
This makes for the 30th letterbox in and around Nebraska!<br/>
<br/>
The clues follow:<br/>
<br/>
Great Plains Geocaching<br/>
<br/>
During the weekend of June 7-8, Great Plains Geocaching<br/>
[http://www.gpgeocaching.com] is sponsoring the Spring 2003 Cache Bash<br/>
at N.P. Dodge Park in Omaha, Nebraska. This letterbox was created<br/>
specifically for this event. Geocachers from all over the Great Plains<br/>
will have to put down their GPS units and use a compass and casual<br/>
orienteering skills to locate this letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
The box was hidden in April to allow it to become "weathered", as well<br/>
as stamped in by area letterboxers. At this point, there is no inkpad<br/>
in the box, but I may put one in for the Geocaching event.<br/>
<br/>
The area is somewhat wooded, and since I hid the box in early Spring,<br/>
the woodland growth hadn't yet returned. I do hope the landmarks and<br/>
trails remain visible during the summer months. If not, please keep<br/>
fact this in mind.<br/>
<br/>
SPECIAL NOTICE: Geocachers and others planning on attending the Spring<br/>
Cache Bash should not read this page beyond this point. The clues to<br/>
the letterbox will not change, and you will want to keep the location<br/>
unknown to yourself and other geocachers.<br/>
<br/>
The Location<br/>
<br/>
Omaha, Douglas County, Nebraska. Look for N.P. Dodge Park in Northeast<br/>
Omaha, along the Missouri River. The trailhead is the exercise trail<br/>
near the boat ramp.<br/>
<br/>
The Clues<br/>
<br/>
* Head east on the trail.<br/>
<br/>
* Seek your fortune with emeralds and diamonds. Note the guards.<br/>
<br/>
* From the eastern guard, spot a very large tree at about 340 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
* Keeping this tree in sight, move east until you can pass into the<br/>
forest. Walk to the tree.<br/>
<br/>
* From base of this tree, spot a gigantic Alpha-22. at 15-20 degrees.<br/>
Walk toward it. You will see smaller Alpha-22 to your left.<br/>
<br/>
* Stop. Turn around and see another, much smaller Alpha-22. You should<br/>
be standing in the center of this triad. You should be able to see<br/>
your previous fortune at 165-170 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
* Proceed 42 steps at 260 degrees to half-naked tree.<br/>
<br/>
* Follow the deer trail to the north. Many deer trails criss-cross<br/>
through this area. Choose your directions wisely.<br/>
<br/>
* At 37 steps a mossy marker will confirm your way. 50 steps will<br/>
bring you to a sudden stop.<br/>
<br/>
* My notes failed me here, as I have two different bearings for the<br/>
same clue. At either 330-340 degrees, or possibly 20-25 degrees, spot<br/>
the hungry sentinel. Approach him carefully using the trails.<br/>
<br/>
* Take about 18 trail-wandering steps at 20-25 degrees to a drunken<br/>
fellow. He holds the letterbox safely.<br/>
<br/>
The Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Contents are double-bagged. Please be sure to seal the bags and the<br/>
container, as I suspect this could be a damp location. <br/>
