   I have been waiting and waiting for the merit badges to arrive in the mail.  I've called TownHall a couple times. Andrea sent them out in November and the package has not returned to them through the PO.  She said she would call me if it showed up. I can only assume the badges are lost in the mail.  I am sorry.  I will refund your money .... I 'll put it in the mail next week.   Once I get a new distributor I will post a note to the talk list.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, I am sorry for the delay  AND for not being able to deliver the badges to you.   If the post office finds them in the lost mail and returns them to me, I'll contact you.   I have recieved mail from the lost mail department before  but it takes several months.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, <br/>
Kay<br/>
