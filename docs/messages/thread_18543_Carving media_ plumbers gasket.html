neither of the two stores near me have it, nor did their employees <br/>

I found the plumbers gasket at Home Depot in their plumbing <br/>
department, and when I spoke to a guy in that department he seemed <br/>
to know exactly what I was talking about.  However, the stuff I <br/>
found and got was like less than 1 cm thick and it was a TERRIBLE <br/>
carving medium.  Now granted I could have missed the wonderful stuff <br/>
they talk about on the list and ended up finding some other version <br/>
of it, I have heard it is a lot thicker, but just in case this is <br/>
what you run into and find when you do find it, pass on it, it's a <br/>
waste.  I had thought maybe if it was mounted it would be alright <br/>
for stamping, but when I tried to carve it, it was like etching a <br/>
line in a crusty slab of mud.<br/>
<br/>
I totally recommend cheap erasers over this any day, and recommend <br/>
either PZ Kut or Dick Blick's, Speedball Pink, or Master carve over <br/>
those =)<br/>
<br/>

I'm just starting out but this is how I've made my stamps.  Don't  carve this <br/>
stuff. It's not thick enough.  I draw my pattern on paper, tape  it over the <br/>
plumber's rubber.  I take a screw driver and a hammer and pound  in my <br/>
pattern.  Then cut out the shape around it.  Kind of like if you  were doing a dog <br/>
you would pound in the details and cut out the dog shape.  <br/>
I love this stuff.  It's cheap and if you use it this way its great  and you <br/>
can get good details.  <br/>
Then I use the craft fun foam thats 50 cents at Walmart and cut out around  <br/>
the shape and glue it all the a piece of wood.  That plumbers stuff is the  <br/>
same rubber it looks like that store bought rubber stamps are made out of and  <br/>
they are really sturdy.<br/>

The only good thing about H.D. is they are cheap just don't ask <br/>
someone a question. I went to my local hardware store, you know the <br/>
place where people use to go when they needed things to fix their <br/>
house before these big super store came to town, he did everything <br/>
but carve it for me.  Get the stuff that is as thick as a 3.5 floppy <br/>
disk not a CD. This stuff is so cheap if you don't like the way it <br/>
carves you only lost out $2. I buy an 8inch X 8inch square for $1.50.<br/>
