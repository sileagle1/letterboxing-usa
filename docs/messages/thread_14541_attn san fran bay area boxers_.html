<br/>
Rustypuff and I will be visiting Fremont, CA, from August 19 to 31, <br/>
and we'd love to meet local boxers for exchanges and boxing.  We have <br/>
a wedding to attend on the 30th, and we will need to spend some time <br/>
with Rustypuff's parents, but otherwise we're open for fun.  (We also <br/>
hope to visit the Jelly Belly factory at some point.)<br/>
<br/>
We are from Holbrook, MA, and Providence, RI, respectively, so here's <br/>
your chance to exchange with a couple of East Coast boxers!<br/>
<br/>
If you'd like to make plans with us, please contact us off-list at <br/>
cscm-@-toast-.-net or hannahkat-@-aol-.-com (remove the dashes, of <br/>
course).<br/>
<br/>
We hope to meet many of you soon!<br/>
