that your destination LB has gone missing,(and I expect that's all of <br/>
us) last weekend I found the Kurdziel's Mother/Daughter series in <br/>
good shape, then stopped by the Naked Woman in the Waterfall, and <br/>
also found that to be where she was supposed to be. Had to reach in <br/>
quite far to pull her out though. Give a good look for her.<br/>
Yesterday I went and found both Drewclan boxes at Wequetequock Salt <br/>
marsh, and I just got back today after claiming  Dan and Melissa's <br/>
Covered Bridge and Verdi boxes.<br/>
Thanks to all for those wonderful hikes, and great stamps.<br/>
