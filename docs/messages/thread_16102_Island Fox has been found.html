<br/>
A geocacher contacted me and states that they have found the fox! <br/>
<br/>
She will be sent to me, if she is in good repair, I will replace her <br/>
in a more hidden place with some geocachers leave me alone notes. <br/>
Perhaps I can obtain a fake rock at the SLO gathering but the rocks <br/>
on the island are very strange and shale like, not granite like at <br/>
all. Perhaps I can spay adhesive some matching dirt on the hidden <br/>
box when we get to the place.<br/>
<br/>
Replacement Question? Should I keep the old stamp log with all the <br/>
Geocachers notes or start a new one There was only one stamper in <br/>
there the Leach family.. and the stamp had already gone away by <br/>
thier visit.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my geocachers correspondance!<br/>
