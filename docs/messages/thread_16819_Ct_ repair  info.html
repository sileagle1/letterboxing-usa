repair. I carved a new Ship to Neverland tonight as well as a roof <br/>
and cupola for the gazebo series it will take me a couple days to get <br/>
them back out. I have box 16 of the Kettle Series in for repair and <br/>
one from Mt. Hope series they will return soon too.  Just notified <br/>
that the Eagleville preserve may be MIA so I will get out there soon <br/>
to verify and replace.  It is on the same trail as the new  Watchful <br/>
Eye. I was out of boxing for awhile and have a lot of catching up to <br/>
do. Thank you to all of you who have fixed a box yourselves  with <br/>
paper or ink or whatever  it really helps!   And when will I get the <br/>
whole bag of boxes in my car planted? Bet you can't wait!    Carol - <br/>
