                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have planted 3 hitch hikers and found a few as well. One plant, "The <br/>
Virginian", we have heard from on occasion. The others, not so much news. We have <br/>
recovered one of our own recently. The book was full of wonderful stamps and it <br/>
was fun to see where it had been. "The Virginian" left Conn., went around <br/>
Mass and Maine, down to Virginia and North Carolina and was last seen a few weeks <br/>
ago in Ohio. We have heard little from our other HH's or the ones we <br/>
transported. Such is their fate. I think we release HH's with the idea we may not here <br/>
from them again. It becomes a bonus part of the hobby when we do.<br/>
  I try not to hold on to a HH too long, but some boxes just can't accomodate <br/>
the company, so it gets put on hold for the next box. I am able to release <br/>
fairly soon because I letterbox fairly often and am in Ct.; a letterbox rich <br/>
environment. <br/>
  Will I continue to plant HH's? Yes, but not on a regular basis. I agree <br/>
there is a HH void, but I guess it comes with the territory. <br/>
