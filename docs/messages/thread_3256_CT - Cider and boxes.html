We like Lyman Orchards, also.  I love all the hikes along ridges in <br/>
the area.  And a corn maze could clinch it for the kids.  Of course, <br/>
maybe we should also plan a trip back to Westwoods and Bishop's <br/>
Orchard...  I love New England in the fall.<br/>

Speaking of corn mazes, has anyone been to the Titanic Corn Maze on Route 2<br/>
in Preston?  Dan and I went a couple of weeks ago and had an awesome time!<br/>
They give you a passport with numbers 1-16.  You can try to go through and<br/>
go straight through the maze, or (this is the fun part) you can try to find<br/>
all 16 lifeboats that are hidden around the maze.  When you find a lifeboat,<br/>
it is numbered and has a stamp attached.  You stamp the corresponding # on<br/>
your passport.  It's really fun if you try to find all 16!  We did and it<br/>
took us about 1 hour and 20 minutes.  They are open Friday, Saturday, and<br/>
Sunday from noon til dusk.  The cost is maybe $5 for adults, and worth every<br/>
penny.  The maze will be open through Halloween.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
    Melissa<br/>
