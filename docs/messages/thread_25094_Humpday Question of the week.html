                    <div class="plaintext-content">In 2007, a friend showed me an article in Family Fun magazine referencing letterboxing.  It was intriguing.  I waiting a couple of weeks until school let out, then I took a couple of stamps from my kids' collection and a stamp pad, and the clue to Conron planted by Silverstar (box and letterboxer no longer about).  I started by using letterboxing.org - which was given in the article.<br/>
<br/>
The stamp was store bought - but so was mine.  The box was very close to the trail, and should have been an easy find - but it was our first and we had a bit of a hard time finding it. (I took two of my kids with me - it was to be our summer entertainment).  But you know...after finding that first box, we just couldn't stop.  <br/>
<br/>
Two years later...my hubby just bought his first log book, and has begun gathering stamps of his own...though he will not admit to being a "letterboxer" (he just loves to hike).  He refuses to take a trail name, but I have hope for him.  I'm a full blown addict.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I love the puzzle boxes - mysteries are my favorite.<br/>
I have decided that the boxes that I plant from here on out, shall have some sort of puzzle associated with them.  No more straight forward clues for me.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Funny, I was just thinking about this with the recent discussion. Last  <br/>
August my sister and I stumbled across the Piglet's Posse letterbox on  <br/>
Mt Willard. We initially thought it was a geocache.<br/>
<br/>
The placer had provided a good explanation and links to LBNA. We  <br/>
signed in but had no stamps. I took the concept home to share with my  <br/>
family; we went searching for the first time the next week.  Our first  <br/>
official find was the By The Sea Series by WeatherednBoston in  <br/>
Ipswich, MA. We were also lucky to find a HH in our first box.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote about it here: http://mack505.blogspot.com/2008/09/new-hobbies.html<br/>
<br/>
We took inspiration for our trail name from Piglet's Posse; we too  <br/>
used the family dog's name and are Cricket's Crew.<br/>
<br/>
Since then we've placed 5 and found a couple dozen throughout New  <br/>
England (and a few in Indiana.)<br/>
<br/>
I hope to get back to Mt Willard soon to properly stamp in.<br/>

My had heard about LBing from people on another Yahoo group and wanted to try it.  I didn't want to(thought it was some kind of sick joke to get people out in the woods looking for tupperware).  So I told her I wanted to do something close to home with very little effort involved(just in case my suspicions were correct).  When my wife pulled away the bark and sticks that were covering the box (YES!!! It was actually there) I was hooked.<br/>

I have a "hobby" of finding and walking obscure preserves and sanctuaries.  While on a mission to locate a preserve in Kennebunk, Maine I passed a small parking lot and mapboard in a section of the Massabesic Experimental Forest.  I turned around and had a great hike down to a breezy lake - and did not see a living soul the whole time.  When I got home, I Googled the trail name and the only thing that came up was a clue page from something called "LBNA."  Thrilled and intrigued, I feverishly read all I could, carved an eraser and set out the next day to look for the "letterbox" I unknowingly walked past.<br/>
Seems like forever ago.  The planter no longer lists her finds online, and I'm light years ahead of where I was then (as a boxer, and otherwise) even though this was only five years ago.<br/>

It was my sister who actually found out about it &amp; printed off that first set of clues, and where she came across it I'm not sure. But the day we went out was Sept. 11, 2004--so the timing fits....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Straight up on the internet is how I discovered letterboxing.  Having signed up for a timeshare week in CT, I was surfing around for things to do.  Reached a site reporting on this outdoor treasure hunt activity they do in CT.  It was November in NewEngland!! I wasn't going outdoors, least of all hiking!!  Certainly not by myself (recent widow).  So on to the web sites for antique malls.  <br/>
<br/>
CT was loverly and the following May I decided to revisit.  Now what was that site???  Something about Letterboxing.  BINGO - found LB.org and then LBNA-USA.  WOW! there were boxes everywhere -- this wasn't just a CT thing!!  Fort Ward Park VA -- had to do some research on Civil War 'rifle trench' and the next day I skipped out at lunch and found "A Flower For Mildred".  It was Apr 7 2004 and a glorious day.  Reading all the log-ins - from folks as far away as MI &amp; WI -- I was ecstatic.<br/>
<br/>
The funny part was in post 90 - Sam I am offered to go boxing with me.  Never having been on a chat list before I thought 'who is this guy and do I want to go into the woods with him?'<br/>
<br/>
Several days later I looked at the members list and duh! Sam I am was a young lady who worked with kids -- I wasn't brought up on Dr Seuss so it hadn't registered.  As it worked out she was my very first exchange.<br/>
<br/>
So here I am hundreds (thousands?) of finds and exchanges later with a wonderful world of friends. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I love reading all these stories! Thanks TT! T2 had a fifth grade teacher who was a letterboxer, and told the kids about it. I was skeptical whenT2 explained it to me, but two days later he came to me with a clue in his hand right in our town. The box was called "Gazebo" and went missing a couple of years ago . . . but it was there on September 11, 2005 when we first found it! The funny part of the story is that we followed all the directions around the town common, and when we came to the area of the box -- maybe a dozen steps into the woods, I said "They wouldn't want you to go into the woods!" -- I guess I should've read something myself before setting out! We ended up going and buying a stamp and going back to the box :) We've come a long way from that first moment, and have loved most of the boxes we've found, and most of the places we've visited! So, keep planting and we'll keep hunting!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We learned about letterboxing from an article in Family Fun -- a respondent ahead of me says that was June 2007.  Looked it up online and ruminated a few months (thus missing our first summer of opportunity).<br/>
<br/>
In November, 2007, I finally ventured forth with the kids to attempt Wicked Craving in Glendora, CA.  We came away having had a yummy breakfast, but didn't find the box.  Tried "LA County Arboretum" a few days later... again, a yummy lunch (we packed a picnic), but no box.<br/>
<br/>
Didn't try again until Easter Vacation, and in April 2007 my husband joined us, dog too, both in camping at the beach and in letterboxing, and we found our first:  Painted Cave near Santa Barbara, CA.  All of us enjoyed the cave, but I had to leave the rest and tromp through the poison oak all by myself.  FOUND THE BOX, THOUGH!!!  Tried a few more in the area, not finding them, and left our stamp behind, as we replanted one that had been reported (by the owner) as missing.  Still trying to get back to Santa Barbara (we now have the owner's permission) to see if it's still there, and make the adoption official.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any Santa Barbarans in this crowd, who would like to check it out for us???  Please, oh pretty please???<br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">My first real box was on Labor Day of 2003.  I had heard about letterboxing<br/>
through a homeschool group I belonged to, where one of the moms suggested it<br/>
as a game to play at one of our outings.  On that outing, it was played more<br/>
like an Easter Egg hunt than letterboxing.  Thankfully I had done a little<br/>
research beforehand and realized that what we were doing was nothing like I<br/>
had read letterboxing as being described, or it would have left me<br/>
thoroughly unimpressed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Problem for me was, the closest box was 20 minutes away, and the next<br/>
closest three were about an hour away.  In total, there were something like<br/>
6 boxes within two hours drive.  I knew I would be hard-pressed to convince<br/>
my husband to waste even the 40 minutes round trip for the closest box on a<br/>
vague promise of something as yet undefined in his mind found on an off-beat<br/>
website  by me, his wife with the penchant for connecting with oddball<br/>
things.  I finally convinced him that we could try it out by planning a trip<br/>
to our favorite state park (where, coincidentally, two of the three boxes<br/>
that were one hour away resided), looking for boxes along the way.  He<br/>
agreed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We set out on Labor Day ill-equipped.  I wasnt working at the time and we<br/>
were on a very tight budget, and since I didnt have the full buy-in of my<br/>
husband or the kids, I knew I had to keep it cheap.  I had managed to find<br/>
two somewhat suitable rubber stamps at home and found two other inexpensive<br/>
rubber stamps at Walmart.  I forgot about logbooks, wasnt sure about<br/>
needing an inkpad (one of the boxes said something about having ink, so I<br/>
didnt know if we would need one for the others).  We wound up stopping at a<br/>
dollar store on the way and buying a wire-bound index card book for our<br/>
logbook and a black inkpad out of the office supply aisle.  I had spent<br/>
about $12 on letterboxing by then, potentially a colossal waste of money on<br/>
our budget.  And we were off again<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On our way to Mission Tejas State Park in Weches, Texas  our favorite state<br/>
park - we passed close by two other boxes.  I suggested we go ahead and stop<br/>
and look for those boxes, but my husband was set on getting to the park<br/>
rather than stopping to waste our time on what he was secretly convinced<br/>
would be a wild goose chase.  He enjoyed the park, liked the hikes it<br/>
offered, and figured we could make good out of that stop at the very least.<br/>
We had spent quite a lot of time there and knew it well.  In fact, I could<br/>
visualize the location of both the boxes in that park.  We set off on a<br/>
little trail to find the first box  Tejas by Baby Bear.  We knew the trail<br/>
so well that we knew exactly where the log in the clue was.  We approached<br/>
it and my moment of doubt hit.  What WAS the likelihood there would really<br/>
be a plastic container where the clues said?  So many things could happen to<br/>
make it not there, starting with it all being one big hoax to someone<br/>
finding it and removing it.  What was really the likelihood that someone<br/>
named Baby Bear could be relied on?  How could we have passed that log so<br/>
many times and never known the box was there?  Finally, I reached to where<br/>
it presumably was, and it was indeed there and I was relieved that I had at<br/>
least not been duped into believing in a vapor game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We opened the box to find the carved stamp by Baby Bear.  We had not known<br/>
what to expect out of hand-carved stamps  had not ever even considered<br/>
that someone would hand-carve a stamp.  It was simple in design, but<br/>
intriguing.  We opened the logbook to find that only one other finder had<br/>
been to this box besides us  Silver Eagle, the author of the other box in<br/>
the park.  I later learned that they are brothers who traveled together and<br/>
planted boxes for each other to find since there were virtually no boxes in<br/>
Texas at that time.  And that is why you will often find a Baby Bear box and<br/>
a Silver Eagle box in the same park in Texas, at least.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, we started to stamp in.  I had really hoped to find a logbook full<br/>
of examples so we could follow suit, but it wasnt to be.  There were four<br/>
of us, and only one previous finder, so we winged it and let me tell you, I<br/>
was really uneasy, not knowing if we were doing it right or not!  We hoped<br/>
for the best and buttoned the box back up, hid it back in its hidey hole,<br/>
where it resides to this very day  I check on it every time I go to that<br/>
park and it still makes me smile to see our store-bought stamps.  They<br/>
signify to me how little we knew about letterboxing way back then!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With the game proven to us, I was eager to continue on to the next box and<br/>
my husband wasnt so skeptical, my daughter was intrigued, and my son <br/>
well, he was only 7 and very laid back, and he was pretty much just along<br/>
for whatever the wind blew his way.  We finished the trail and headed back<br/>
to our car to go and find Silver Eagles box, another work of wonder for us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With two boxes under our belts, my husband was more willing to make detours<br/>
for boxes, so on our way home we stopped for the two we had passed.  That<br/>
was the end of our boxing for several months because one of the boxes near<br/>
us went missing about the time we started and the third in our 2 hour radius<br/>
was on the very outskirts and so out of reach for awhile.   Did I mention<br/>
that all of these boxes were by either Silver Eagle or Baby Bear?  To this<br/>
day, their boxes are among my favorite to find.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I didnt mention was that Labor Day is the day of the year my dad died<br/>
in 1987.  He died when I was 24 years old, barely a grown-up really, and I<br/>
still had a lot to learn from him about life.  I was very close to him and<br/>
in 2003 I still had not really reconciled myself to his death and Labor Day<br/>
was very difficult every year.  Probably the biggest reason my husband<br/>
agreed to go was because it was something active to get us up and going and<br/>
not dwelling on the day.  As it turned out, letterboxing was a very<br/>
therapeutic activity for me that day  I hardly considered the significance<br/>
of the day until we were on our way home, and I realized how much my dad<br/>
would have approved of spending our time as we had.  As Ive grown and<br/>
learned in letterboxing, Ive come to know  over and over again  that this<br/>
is an activity my dad and I would most certainly enjoy together if he were<br/>
still alive.  It has all the elements that he loved  he was a dedicated<br/>
outdoorsman, a knowledgeable naturalist, had a quick mind for puzzles, and a<br/>
wicked sense of humor.   He would have LOVED letterboxing and being his<br/>
daughter, I do too!<br/>

Our first letterbox was inspired by a Girl Scout badge that can be<br/>
earned by older girls, called Hi-Tech Hide and Seek. The requirements<br/>
of the badge include learning about the history of the hobby, so my<br/>
daughter and I researched letterboxing (on LBNA) and geocaching. We<br/>
decided to give letterboxing a try. Since none of us is artistic, we<br/>
searched Ebay for stamps that reflected our personalities and bought<br/>
them. They arrived in time for our family's spring break trip from Kansas to<br/>
Arizona in March, 2006. My husband and two sons, with stamps in tow,<br/>
joined in the hunt. Our first letterbox find was "Tucson" by Azroadie.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was hooked! I travel with my job and since then, I have found over 150 traditional boxes<br/>
in 19 states plus one in Alberta, Canada. My daughter will search for<br/>
letterboxes but is not terribly enthusiastic, although one of her<br/>
friends has enjoyed participating with us. My husband and one of our<br/>
sons (and now his girlfriend) are excited about the activity - the four<br/>
of us will be attending LB Con 09 in St. Louis next week.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I really stumbled into letterboxing.  While doing research on the computer I typed a link wrong and it took me to someone's blog and they were talking about letterboxing with their family.  This thing really intrigued me and I read late into the night.  A few days after discovering that blog, my husband had a meeting in Savannah, GA.  This was August of 2007.  I logged on to the letterboxing.org site and found that were lots of boxes right in downtown Savannah.  Great - I had something I could do while he was in his business meeting.  This was going to be so much better than just window shopping.  He thought I was crazy - going out in town looking for tupperware boxes hidden under bushes.  I spent all day looking for those 4 boxes and I was hooked.  My neice and nephew always spend the summer with us here in SW Florida.  They wanted me to watch the movie National Treasure with them in the summer of 2008.  After that I asked would you like to go find a type of treasure where we have clues and we use a rubber stamp to let others know we found it.  Now both of them are hooked and we letterbox while they are visiting. <br/>

Howdy, Hansenclan,<br/>
 We're from Santa Barbara, loosely speaking - Summerland, really - we have about a dozen or so letterboxes we've set in the area &amp; your stamp has been noted in most all of them, I think. Thanks for visitng us! John &amp; I would be happy to check on the box that may or maynot be missing &amp; let you know its status. Just say the word &amp; email us the clue(s).<br/>

We learned about letterboxing from an article in Family Fun -- a respondent ahead of me says that was June 2007. Looked it up online and ruminated a few months (thus missing our first summer of opportunity) .<br/>
<br/>
In November, 2007, I finally ventured forth with the kids to attempt Wicked Craving in Glendora, CA. We came away having had a yummy breakfast, but didn't find the box. Tried "LA County Arboretum" a few days later... again, a yummy lunch (we packed a picnic), but no box.<br/>
<br/>
Didn't try again until Easter Vacation, and in April 2007 my husband joined us, dog too, both in camping at the beach and in letterboxing, and we found our first: Painted Cave near Santa Barbara, CA. All of us enjoyed the cave, but I had to leave the rest and tromp through the poison oak all by myself. FOUND THE BOX, THOUGH!!! Tried a few more in the area, not finding them, and left our stamp behind, as we replanted one that had been reported (by the owner) as missing. Still trying to get back to Santa Barbara (we now have the owner's permission) to see if it's still there, and make the adoption official.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any Santa Barbarans in this crowd, who would like to check it out for us??? Please, oh pretty please???<br/>
<br/>

I was walking my dog Molly out on the trails of Schoolhouse Brook Park in Mansfield CT and I saw this guy looking at a sheet of paper and looking like he wasn't sure which trail to go on, so we went up to him and I asked him if he needed any help. He told me he was letterboxing and said just a little about it.One thing he mentionedthoughwas that there was one right next to a trail in a short stonewall not far from where we were. I knew thearea very welland knew that there was only 1 very short piece of stone wall right up next to the trail and nearby. He went on his way and I went to look at the stone wall. I quickly found the "Chick In The Nest" letterbox by the Cock-A-Doodle-Moo 4H Club also known now as Carolyn. I was lucky to find an LBNA letterboxing info sheet that she put in the box. Took the sheet home, read it, went out and got us some store boughtstamps at a local store called Kathy-Johns that had a great selection of stamps. I<br/>
 went back to the box on December 29, 2001 and got my first find. I stamped the box image on an index card and put the card in protective pages used by postcard collectors. Didn't use a trail name, just used our first names. So I became "Chuck and Molly" because I never was without my dog Molly. My wife soon joined in and took the trail name Chickabirdie because of her love ofwild birds and her stamp was a chickadee. Our name changed to "Chuck and Amy"and Chickabirdieafter Molly passed away from cancer and we got a new dog namedAmy. We used store bought stamps as our sig stamps for many years.Only recently did we change to 1hand made stamp for all three of us (Chickabirdie, Amy (dog), and myself). Wealso choose a group trail name of WWW (We Who Wander). We never didhave a log book or journal. Even today l still stamp our finds on index cards....Chuck of WWW <br/>

<br/>
Silver Eagle brought clues to this box along with us on our backpacking trip to Glacier NP.   We flew in and out of Spokane, so on our return from the park we had some free time the last night, and he pulled out the clues and said why don't we give this a try.  The clues took us all over this park, and we were getting sceptical. Finally they brought us to a bridge, and while SE read the clues I reached under and found the boxt.  Of course we had not stamps, pen, logs, anything, but luckily the box had extra images of the stamp pre-stamped in it!  Also, it had a hitch-hiker ("Hitch"), which created a whole new problem.  So, we replaced the box, took the HH, and headed home, and were both hooked.  Now we had to create a box in order to get rid of the HH, since Texas only had 9 boxes when we started, and many were no longer there.   I'm sure glad the box at Finch was there, or we may never have gone the next step.   <br/>

I heartly agree.  After my mother died, I found solace in the hike and the hunt knowing that she would have loved to be outside with me.<br/>
<br/>
I first heard of letterboxing from a friend of a mutual friend.  Don't remember how we got on the subject but ended with a phone call to find out the web address.  My daughter and I were immediately intrigued and followed up and were soon off to hunt.  My first box was Der Mad Drummer in Farmington, CT by Rubaduc.<br/>
<br/>
Many boxes and many miles since, we are still happily addicted. Still enjoy the benefit of exercise and being led to new trails.<br/>

Good TOTW. :D<br/>
<br/>
My first find was actually the second 'box I attempted.  I had discovered letterboxing while looking (on-line) into Geocaching but 'boxing appealed to me much more than 'caching.  I printed clues from LbNA to two NeeDeeps 'boxes:  Frog Rock and Kentucky State Stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Initially I couldn't find the Frog Rock 'box but I found the Kentucky SS 'box easily.  I wouldn't give up on Frog Rock however, and I went back (the two 'boxes were within walking distance of each other.)  I found it and I was hooked, that was in November 2005.<br/>

combo a couple of days ago where all I could really do was paste in the<br/>
clues and the stamp image.  There was just nothing else to say about the<br/>
box.  So that scrapbook page awaits another set of clues and another stamp<br/>
image, rather than waste an entire page.  When friends flip thru my<br/>
scrapbooks and come to a page like that they'll say something like "Oh!<br/>
Guess there wasn't really much *to* these finds, eh?"  Sometimes I'll find a<br/>
hitchhiker in one of those boxes and I can build a page around the<br/>
hitchhiker.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Then there are some boxes to which I give 2 or 3 pages of cropping.  So it<br/>
all evens out in the end I guess.  I just wish I had a better digital<br/>
camera.  I need a good macrolens.  But, alas, that's not in the budget right<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
Which was the reason why I didn't answer what was the longest distance you<br/>
ever went just to letterbox.  Because the answer is pretty much NOwhere.<br/>
:-) Well, OK, maybe 10 or 15 miles.  We can't afford the luxury.  Heck, I<br/>
live in Illinois and just to box in southern or western Illinois we need<br/>
another reason to have to go there.  That's Life As We Know It.<br/>

I do take a camera when we go. Someday my teenage daughter will appreciate the pictures of her hiking through the brush for a little box. Maybe a nice collage at her wedding reception...hhhmmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though, the few boxes I have found have been is spectacular places with great views. The camera is a must.<br/>

Do you take a camera along with you when you box? Taken any good shots<br/>
while out boxing? Let's see them. I'll go first.<br/>
<br/>
During our stay in St. Louis, Kreepy Kelli and I were constantly amazed at<br/>
the beautiful architecture and street art downtown. Although this picture<br/>
wasn't taken on the "trail" so to speak, it was taking while urban boxing by<br/>
Kreepy Kelli who managed to take over 1000 photos (ever hear of the<br/>
continuous shot setting?)<br/>
<br/>
Here is the tiny url to the photo: http://tiny. cc/dlmJV<br/>
<br/>
And a tiny url to the Regional Arts Commission page about the Loud Mouth<br/>
Bass Band http://tiny. cc/JsEnP<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to add a photo remembering the size limitations!<br/>
