Last night we went back to CCC to try again for Duck Pond, figuring that since the pond is dry, we wouldn't drop the stamp off the bridge and loose it as we did last spring. Success! We liked the moss covered rock, and hope that a strong wind doesn't come along!<br/>
Then we headed for WW's Boxed Set, very nice set, wonderfully # 5; LetterBoxers, was our 100th box !!!!<br/>
With time to spare we made our way to Elk Rock Island.  Coincidentally, DMS's Triple Falls box was our 1st box, and now one of his is our 101st.  We want more!   <br/>
<br/>
Hey Wild Woman, just to let you know we are still talking about your Department of Redundancy Department box, so clever in every sense!  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you everyone, what a great way to enjoy our beautiful world and discover new places in our own neighborhoods that we would otherwise never think to visit!<br/>
