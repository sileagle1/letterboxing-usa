&gt; Subject:       [L-USA] ICQ chat summary<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Sunday, February 28th, 1999, 2:00pm EST.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Attended: Thomas Cooch (VT)<br/>
&gt;           Julie Jeffries (TX)          <br/>
&gt;           Dan Servatius (MN)<br/>
&gt;           Adrian Willians (UK)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As you know Thom Cheney was called a way at the last minute<br/>
&gt; and could not attend.  We were sort of expecting Mitch too<br/>
&gt; but did not see him.  Since Mitch was not there we took up<br/>
&gt; the discussion of sending stamps to the U.K. instead of <br/>
&gt; discussing Compass use for Kids, which will have to be<br/>
&gt; rescheduled for a later time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, Mitch, I lost your phone number.  I was going to call<br/>
&gt; you by voice phone.  And Tom was willing to try that too,<br/>
&gt; but to no avail... we'll have to get your number from you<br/>
&gt; later so we can reach you if we need to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Julie's son figured out how to arrange it so all four of<br/>
&gt; us could see the other 3 in ICQ.  Apparently, the person who<br/>
&gt; first requests the chat is the one who must enable the others<br/>
&gt; to come up on the screen all at the same time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think it went for about an hour, and I thought it was a<br/>
&gt; blast.  For some reason there was a time lag between Julie<br/>
&gt; and Adrian, so Julie was seeing my response to Adrian before<br/>
&gt; seeing what Adrian had said.  I guess this had something to do<br/>
&gt; with the routing of the data from the U.K. to Texas (but Randy<br/>
&gt; Hall would know much more about that than I.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here is basically what was proposed:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Each state's first stamp is elected to be included in a charity<br/>
&gt; walk put on by Adrian and his friends.  Their meet is coming<br/>
&gt; up in 4 weeks so we would want to get these submitted farily<br/>
&gt; quickly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Additionally, one or more bonus letterboxes may be created for<br/>
&gt; those who were not the first in their state to make a letterbox.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can submit your stamp in several ways.  You can put the image<br/>
&gt; on the web. (If you send it to me or Thom or Erik I think we can<br/>
&gt; scan it for you and get it put on the web.)  Or, you can send a<br/>
&gt; copy of the original to Adrian Williams.  I don't remember the<br/>
&gt; address, but I'm sure he will let us know.  They do NOT need a<br/>
&gt; hand-carved stamp or original, but you are not prohibited from<br/>
&gt; making one -- just make it a copy of your original (first) stamp.<br/>
&gt; They will send the stamp image out to be made into a stamp.  There<br/>
&gt; is a cost incurred, but it sounds like they are willing to do it.<br/>
&gt; We just need to submit copies of our images.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The proceeds for the charity walk will go toward the National<br/>
&gt; Preservation of Parks in the U.K. (I think).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, that's about all I know.  Julie and Tom were also there.<br/>
&gt; And of course, I'm sure we will be hearing from Adrian soon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also think the easiest way to submit a stamp image (for me anyway)<br/>
&gt; would be to just snail-mail it.  The drawback here is that only<br/>
&gt; the Dartmoorians will see it then (unless you are planning on going<br/>
&gt; there sometime.)  So if you want your image to be included in a <br/>
&gt; "virtual review" of stamp images here on the web you will have to<br/>
&gt; send me a copy (either a paper copy or a scanned file image).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My snail mail addy is as follows:<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Take care ya'll,<br/>
&gt; Dan'l<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ps. I hope I got all this information put down correctly.  If not,<br/>
&gt; someone should let me know.<br/>

Sorry to have missed the ICQ session.  Accompanied my wife on an appointment,<br/>
and it went longer than anticipated.  Glad to hear it went well.  This will<br/>
certainly be another great communication tool for our group.<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
