I found The Art Store in NOHO has it.  A bit out of the way for me but<br/>
at least it's right by the subway line I use anyway...<br/>

I haven't checked Sam Flax, but at the other big art store, Pearl, <br/>
down on Canal street, they had a few small sheets of speedball, some <br/>
mounting blocks (just plain blocks of wood, not the nice ones)and <br/>
they had a kit with some basic tools in it. <br/>
<br/>
It's been my experience that most of the art stores here in <br/>
Manhattan seem to consider some things to be too "crafty" for them. <br/>
Either they don't have some things or have a very smmall selection.  <br/>
<br/>
I've already decided that I'll probably wind up getting most of my <br/>
supplies online. <br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; I haven't checked Sam Flax, but at the other big art store, Pearl, <br/>
&gt; down on Canal street, they had a few small sheets of speedball, <br/>
some <br/>
&gt; mounting blocks (just plain blocks of wood, not the nice ones)and <br/>
&gt; they had a kit with some basic tools in it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's been my experience that most of the art stores here in <br/>
&gt; Manhattan seem to consider some things to be too "crafty" for <br/>
them. <br/>
&gt; Either they don't have some things or have a very smmall <br/>
selection.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've already decided that I'll probably wind up getting most of my <br/>
&gt; supplies online. <br/>

Pearl must vary its stock by location; the one in Paramus has the <br/>
pink stuff in two or three sizes in with the ink pads and stamps, <br/>
and the white Speedball and all the carving tools (both Speedball <br/>
and house brand) over with the lino blocks.<br/>
And oodles and oodles of crafty stuff - yeah, must be location. <br/>
We're just not that sophisticated out in the 'burbs.<br/>
