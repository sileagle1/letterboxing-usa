                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good points.  I've been watching a few of the AQ boards the past few weeks and it appears to me that a lot of the people there think that AQ *is* letterboxing...  they have no idea lbna exists -- even if they are aware of it, don't use it, and don't really participate in the regional Yahoo groups.<br/>
<br/>
If kind of feels like there are two camps -- the more veteran letterboxers, many of whom don't really even letterbox that much any more, who hang around the regional Yahoo groups and primarily use lbna for letterbox clues, and then there is this whole group of other letterboxers, many newer, but not all, who think that AQ is the be-all and end-all of letterboxing and seem overly obsessed with how many boxes they've found and how to make sure every last once is accounted for in their online tally.  Of course there is some cross-over here and there, but for the most part it is two distinct groups.<br/>
<br/>
On the "traditional letterboxes" AQ board there are a mere 30 messages for the entire month of Feb., on only a couple of subjects -- how to properly list a series to get credit for all stamps, how big to make a stamp, etc.  No talk anywhere of mystery or cool box ideas or even awesome finds (although I guess you don't need to talk about that any more, rather just rate the box and maybe help it get a "blue diamond").<br/>
<br/>
So why is it a lot of veteran players don't letterbox that much any more (other than the fact that it is winter at present in many places)?  Has the game changed so much since we first were hooked that the *new and improved* flavor just doesn't hold our interest?  Has it just run its course in our lives and we've moved on to other obsessions?  Have letterboxes become commonplace and most ideas overdone?  Have we finally given up hope and grown tired of replacing missing boxes?  Something else?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Although I use AQ more often, I still check LbNA when going to visit an area for a day of boxing. I've also listed a few boxes on LbNA only as a present for those willing to look there. It is a bit funny that posting a box on LbNA only is a bit like making it a semi-mystery.<br/>
<br/>
I think that AQ is much more popular to use because it's a more convenient tool. LbNA has made conscious decisions over the years to limit the developments of convenience features, limiting some to turning them on in Member Services. The main argument for these limits has been that the extra effort is part of the letterboxing experience and having a no frills approach provides an alternative to AQ for those that value that part of the experience.  Vive la choix!<br/>

LBNA seems like a LETTERBOXING site and AQ seems like a more general rubber stamping site.  Some people seem to consider anything they do with a rubber stamp to be a letterbox.  We don't have the same opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I've had people email me telling me to put my clues on AQ, otherwise people won't look for the box.  Oh, well, then they won't look for the box. <br/>
<br/>
However we will consult AQ and other assorted web sites and message boards for clues.<br/>
<br/>
I'm happy to be in a region that still has a vibrant Yahoo message group.  We've been boxing for 6.5 years and still enjoy getting put to plant &amp; find boxes and meet other letterboxers on a regular basis.  We've met lots of fun people all across the country.  Thanks to all of you who put boxes out on hikes with interesting clues!!!<br/>

&gt; then there is this whole group of other letterboxers, many newer, but not<br/>
&gt; all, who think that AQ is the be-all and end-all of letterboxing and seem<br/>
&gt; overly obsessed with how many boxes they've found and how to make sure every<br/>

&gt; cross-over here and there, but for the most part it is two distinct groups.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the "traditional letterboxes" AQ board there are a mere 30 messages for<br/>

I've been in hibernation for the winter. Used to get out in bad weather, but I am getting old.<br/>
<br/>
I expect things will pick up in the Spring, but the economy is having an effect also. I personally don't drive anywhere I don't have to these days. Besides the cost of fuel, my cars are getting old and I can't afford to replace them.<br/>
<br/>
Many people are either unemployed or working three jobs trying to get by. They simply don't have the time and resources to letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I use both LBNA and Atlasquest to look for boxes and to post clues, as some people use one and some the other. I agree that Facebook, etc. are putting a dent in traditional websites and email groups - email is so unreliable with spam filters that you never can be sure of your messages getting through. I've noticed that many (non-letterboxing) sites I frequent are joining Facebook, while keeping the traditional websites running also. It is more work, but it is probably necessary at this time. It would give a boost to letterboxing. There are a few letterboxing groups on Facebook, but none seem to be connected with the "big two".<br/>

I don't think I talk and plan too much on either - that I do in person with my boving friends. And I like a lot of what we have done!  I will say I'm always going to be more of a traditional boxer - but maybe if I were craftier and had more time the whole LTC and logbook-making would be more important to me. So I tend to carve, hike, plant, and find - and use both sites as resources!  Who says I have to choose??<br/>

Although I use AQ more often, I still check LbNA when going to visit an area for a day of boxing. I've also listed a few boxes on LbNA only as a present for those willing to look there. It is a bit funny that posting a box on LbNA only is a bit like making it a semi-mystery.<br/>
<br/>
I think that AQ is much more popular to use because it's a more convenient tool. LbNA has made conscious decisions over the years to limit the developments of convenience features, limiting some to turning them on in Member Services. The main argument for these limits has been that the extra effort is part of the letterboxing experience and having a no frills approach provides an alternative to AQ for those that value that part of the experience.

Good to hear from you Spring Chick. I was at a gather recently and a few of the newer boxers had never heard of any other lists besides AQ.<br/>
I too am getting the feeling of 2 camps. Alot of the boxers from my early days have faded away but here in the cozy little mid-atlantic we still have a group who have been at it for years. Most week-ends will find someone on the trail.<br/>

It does seem alot of well intentioned people think anything with a rubberstamp is to be called letterboxing. I was an avid rubberstamper before I came into letterboxing but didn't even think my cards and ATC's were letterboxing. <br/>
I'm glad peoople want to be creative but it's just not a box for me if there's not a little walking involved.<br/>

&gt; We also put our clues only on LBNA, unless it is an International box.  Boxes in other countries we will list on both sites.  LBNA seems like a LETTERBOXING site and AQ seems like a more general rubber stamping site.  Some people seem to consider anything they do with a rubber stamp to be a letterbox.  We don't have the same opinion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've had people email me telling me to put my clues on AQ, otherwise people won't look for the box.  Oh, well, then they won't look for the box. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However we will consult AQ and other assorted web sites and message boards for clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm happy to be in a region that still has a vibrant Yahoo message group.  We've been boxing for 6.5 years and still enjoy getting put to plant &amp; find boxes and meet other letterboxers on a regular basis.  We've met lots of fun people all across the country.  Thanks to all of you who put boxes out on hikes with interesting clues!!!<br/>

I think the whole LTC thing is really an off shoot of what letterboxing <br/>
seems to have become, and that is more about the stamp and less about <br/>
where that stamp is and how you get there.<br/>
<br/>
The original letterbox, the Crenmore Pool box, was entirely about the <br/>
location and the journey.  There wasn't even a stamp, it was just <br/>
thought of later as a way to record that you were there, that you found <br/>
this obcure little pond in the middle of nowhere.  To me, that is one of <br/>
the great things about letterboxing, the discovery, be it a letterbox on <br/>
a nice walk, at a great view, or even in a museum or coffee shop.  The <br/>
clue takes you on that journey to get there, to that wonderful place, <br/>
and the letterbox is simply proof that you have been there.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that the story is lost on many people.  To them a great <br/>
letterbox is simply which one has a great stamp.  So why not simply <br/>
eliminate the letterbox altogether?  I guess then, simply doing stamp <br/>
art, does not seem as exciting, so they still call it letterboxing, even <br/>
though they have actually done away with the letterbox.  But I guess it <br/>
does make it easier.<br/>
<br/>
Schizokeet and I recently visited Hickory, NC.  There are tons and tons <br/>
of boxes around that area, and I looked at the clues for nearly all of <br/>
them, and frankly was disappointed.  Such great potential, such great <br/>
places, yet the clues were lousy, the plants even worse.  I mean, who <br/>
wants to find a letterbox in the parking lot of a car dealership?  Well, <br/>
there are about 20 of them.  Where is the journey?  The adventure?<br/>
<br/>
How very sad that this is what letterboxing has become.<br/>

It might fly, but someone would have to create a new site/database for that new 'hide-n-seek' game.I'd join and I'd still letterbox and geocache. Wonder what it would be called? 'Questing' has already been taken but I think it's a good word. <br/>

<br/>
That being said, I do feel that choosing not to buy in, choosing to play in a more traditional way, has become more difficult due to lack of like-minded individuals.<br/>
<br/>
Several years ago, there were far fewer letterboxes in my area, but the boxes that were being planted for the most part involved a hike and had clues of a much higher challenge than most I see now.  Likewise, the letterboxers playing the game at that time thought nothing of spending an entire Saturday afternoon hiking a few miles and nabbing 1-2 boxes.  Now those boxes on longer hikes, often with quality clues, languish unfound for months/years because there are handfuls of boxes easily found on the edges of the parking lot.  Sure, these people *could* choose to ignore the gimme boxes in the parking lot and head off down the trail for a nice hike with a box at the end of some challenging clues...  but I am not seeing that so much, rather there has been a mentality shift that more boxes is better, regardless of the quality of the box, the clues and the location.<br/>
<br/>
Even though there is nothing forcing me to buy into that mentality, it is a bit lonely playing a game alone.<br/>

Very well put... it is letterboxers who changed the game and each of us has the choice of whether to buy into the changes or not.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I do feel that choosing not to buy in, choosing to play in a more traditional way, has become more difficult due to lack of like-minded individuals.<br/>
<br/>
Several years ago, there were far fewer letterboxes in my area, but the boxes that were being planted for the most part involved a hike and had clues of a much higher challenge than most I see now. Likewise, the letterboxers playing the game at that time thought nothing of spending an entire Saturday afternoon hiking a few miles and nabbing 1-2 boxes. Now those boxes on longer hikes, often with quality clues, languish unfound for months/years because there are handfuls of boxes easily found on the edges of the parking lot. Sure, these people *could* choose to ignore the gimme boxes in the parking lot and head off down the trail for a nice hike with a box at the end of some challenging clues... but I am not seeing that so much, rather there has been a mentality shift that more boxes is better, regardless of the quality of the box, the clues and the location.<br/>
<br/>
Even though there is nothing forcing me to buy into that mentality, it is a bit lonely playing a game alone.<br/>

&gt; i have been reading these posts with interest and now i think i have my<br/>
&gt; thoughts together.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i also remember when lbna was the only kid on the block. and then aq moved<br/>
&gt; in. aq had a bit fancier house and a lot of parties going on, but did not<br/>
&gt; really change the game. so what did?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; perhaps it was a bunch of well meaning articles that said..... look at this<br/>
&gt; secret game. hey, wasn't the key work secret? letterboxers changed the game.<br/>
&gt; we changed it by calling attention to ourselves and then not teaching the<br/>
&gt; rules of the game. sure we did our best, but some just didn't get the<br/>
&gt; reading and researching part. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; so now we have changes that aren't traditional letterboxing. such as postals<br/>
&gt; ltc's and virtuals. ask yourself, does this really change letterboxing? i<br/>
&gt; can tell you it doesn't for me. i do postals, have dabbled in ltc's and a<br/>
&gt; couple of virtuals. none of these take the place of letterboxing. none of<br/>
&gt; them take the place of the hike or the thrill of cracking that extra hard<br/>
&gt; clue. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i have been letterboxing now for 8 years and the game, for me, has not<br/>
&gt; changed. i am the one that chooses which boxes i will look for. i am the one<br/>
&gt; that chooses where i will go. i am the one that will ultimately enjoy the<br/>
&gt; journey. i am responsible for the quality (or lack there of) of my plants<br/>
&gt; and clues. i am the only one that can change the game for me, and i don't<br/>
&gt; plan on changing. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; now all of the rant above does not mean i am not concerned about the trends<br/>
&gt; i see. the poor plants, the kindergarten clues (hey, i was there once also)<br/>
&gt; and the overall lack of knowledge.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; what i do believe is that those who are not serious about the game will fade<br/>
&gt; away... just another trend. those of us who are serious about the game will<br/>
&gt; be having this same conversation 5 years down the road.<br/>

Actually I consider myself fortunate to live in the Great Lakes area where there are many wonderful letterboxers and boxes.  It just seems the number is dwindling and instead of being the norm as it once was, it is now a small minority.  It distracts me; I don't like wading through clue after clue of boxes that have little to offer in terms of *the letterboxing experience* to find the few gems.  But hey, that's just my take on it...  something for everyone, right?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">So true! Likewise I often letterbox with grandchildren in tow... but on a trail, not in a parking lot. I will never forget the first time I took my oldest grandson out boxing when he was 2.  I had no idea how far a 2-yr. old could hike, but chose a trail where there was a shorter-distance box (mine, so I knew it was there) and a box further along on the trail (not mine).  I figured at the least we would get the nearer box; he didn't have to know it was mine -- it would still be a fun treasure to find.  My thought was to go until he began to slow down a little and then turn around, even if we hadn't made the further box, and nab the closer box on the way back.  Little did I know that 2-year olds go full bore until they're done.  There is no in between, no slowing down phase.  So we were about a mile out on the trail, less than 100 yards to the further box and he sat down and announced, "grandma, I'm done now."  That was it... "done now."  There was no convincing to go just a little further, no understanding that the car was a mile back the way we came...  So it was up on the shoulders, to the box and then back.  He's 8 now and an entire afternoon of hiking is no big deal -- he's usually the one saying, "can we look for one more?" when I say it's time to be done!<br/>

&gt; "easier" boxes are doing so because we are hoping to share our passion for<br/>
&gt; hiking and boxing with small children who may not be able to handle a more<br/>
&gt; challenging hike.   While I would love to spend an entire Saturday hiking, I<br/>
&gt; would also love to spend an entire Saturday with the short people in my<br/>
&gt; house who are really amazing (and whose definition of "long hike" is<br/>
&gt; different from mine).    We also find letterboxes during roadtrips as a way<br/>
&gt; to stretch our legs and see places we might otherwise miss, and my<br/>
&gt; appreciation for the people who place those short-hike boxes is vast!<br/>

&gt; Very well put... it is letterboxers who changed the game and each of us has<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; That being said, I do feel that choosing not to buy in, choosing to play in<br/>
&gt; a more traditional way, has become more difficult due to lack of like-minded<br/>
&gt; individuals.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Several years ago, there were far fewer letterboxes in my area, but the<br/>
&gt; boxes that were being planted for the most part involved a hike and had<br/>
&gt; clues of a much higher challenge than most I see now. Likewise, the<br/>
&gt; letterboxers playing the game at that time thought nothing of spending an<br/>
&gt; entire Saturday afternoon hiking a few miles and nabbing 1-2 boxes. Now<br/>
&gt; those boxes on longer hikes, often with quality clues, languish unfound for<br/>
&gt; months/years because there are handfuls of boxes easily found on the edges<br/>
&gt; of the parking lot. Sure, these people *could* choose to ignore the gimme<br/>
&gt; boxes in the parking lot and head off down the trail for a nice hike with a<br/>
&gt; box at the end of some challenging clues... but I am not seeing that so<br/>
&gt; much, rather there has been a mentality shift that more boxes is better,<br/>
&gt; regardless of the quality of the box, the clues and the location.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Even though there is nothing forcing me to buy into that mentality, it is a<br/>
&gt; bit lonely playing a game alone.<br/>

&gt; &gt; so now we have changes that aren't traditional letterboxing. such as<br/>

&gt; &gt; can tell you it doesn't for me. i do postals, have dabbled in ltc's and a<br/>

&gt; &gt; them take the place of the hike or the thrill of cracking that extra hard<br/>
&gt; &gt; clue.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; i have been letterboxing now for 8 years and the game, for me, has not<br/>
&gt; &gt; changed. i am the one that chooses which boxes i will look for. i am the<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt; that chooses where i will go. i am the one that will ultimately enjoy the<br/>
&gt; &gt; journey. i am responsible for the quality (or lack there of) of my plants<br/>
&gt; &gt; and clues. i am the only one that can change the game for me, and i don't<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; now all of the rant above does not mean i am not concerned about the<br/>

&gt; &gt; and the overall lack of knowledge.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; what i do believe is that those who are not serious about the game will<br/>

To some it is that long hike, to some it is the stamp itself, or location. Whatever the reason there is no wrong or right way to box. Except of course after finding it you rehide it better than you found it. Which we have been finding a problem lately. After reading these posts the past few days I am finding there are a lot of LB snobs! If I was a new boxer I would be very discouraged to even want to become part of this hobby.

1.  Camaraderie<br/>

Postal Letterboxing... Okay, so maybe that's kind of a misnomer, but here<br/>
are the good sides of this branch of the hobby:<br/>
<br/>
1. Camaraderie<br/>
2. Those in WINTERY climates can still participate,<br/>
even when they can't get outdoors much.<br/>
3. Carving skills and logbook-making skills improve greatly.<br/>
<br/>
That's just my two cents -- and I only do postal letterboxes in the winter.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; activities.<br/>
&gt; However I don't know why some of them use the term letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I remember the first time I saw a postal letterbox. Funhog had received it from Legerdemaine, and she brought it to a gathering to show off since it didn't seem practical to mail it to everyone individually. It was pretty awesome too. I'd never seen a Legerdemaine stamp before, and it had so many wonderful stamps in it from the east coast in the logbook that I'd never seen before. Funhog said it was the letterbox that comes to you, certainly a unique twist to the game. We were even allowed to count it as a find. For all intents and purposes, it really seemed like a letterbox to everyone. An unusual letterbox, to be sure, but not really any more unusual than a hitchhiker which was by then very well established.<br/>
<br/>
Then AQ came along and "ruined" letterboxing. Ah, well, live and learn. AQ 1.0 didn't have support for anything except "real" letterboxes, but almost immediately, a huge problem started occurring--all these hitchhikers and postals were being listed as "mystery boxes" because that was the "best" option available. Which was a problem for me, because I didn't count them as mystery boxes, and it cluttered up the real mystery boxes with all these fake mystery boxes.<br/>
<br/>
So I set up categories for these other types, mostly as a way to segregate those "fake letterboxes" from the real ones. It's kind of ironic, but my adding support for those non-traditional boxes did more to distinguish the real letterboxes from the pseudo boxes than anything LbNA did, which to this day says you can count hitchhikers as a "real" letterbox--something AQ hasn't allowed from day 1.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually LbNA had to start distinguishing between the real letterboxes and pseudo boxes, eventually adding support for "travellers" to get people to stop listing them all as mystery boxes. The support for these other types wasn't nearly as thorough as what I created on AQ, and most people who participated in postals, virtuals, and such pretty much list those types exclusively on Atlas Quest. And it's that fantastic? Does anyone here really *want* all that stuff listed on LbNA? The fact that support for them is so good on Atlas Quest helps take the pressure off of LbNA to add support for those pseudo-boxes, except for that throw-away category of "travellers" that's easy to ignore.<br/>
<br/>
The complaints about calling these stand-ins as "letterboxes" actually did start with LbNA, so I'm not really fond when I see people blaming Atlas Quest for that turn of events. At the time, when that first postal box was released, it seemed harmless enough to call it a letterbox. Not like anyone expected the concept to grow into hundreds and then thousands of listings. In hindsight, I think it was a mistake, but what's done is done.<br/>
<br/>
But everyone on Atlas Quest is well aware of the differences between a real letterbox and the pseudo boxes. Collectively, we might call all of them letterboxes, but it's a term born out of historical context. Something like the "spirit" of letterboxing, if not the actual thing. A way to share stamps we'd otherwise never see, a way to connect with people that we may otherwise never meet. <br/>
<br/>
So no, postals, virtuals, hitchhikers, cooties, LTCs.... none of these are real letterboxes. The folks who use Atlas Quest are well aware of this fact, and if there is anyone on the site who does not believe this to be the case, I'll be the first one to set them straight. The official P and F-counts that AQ tallies does not include any of these pseudo-boxes in the counts. The main page on Atlas Quest only has a search option for real letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem if an individual decides that none of these alternative types of boxes are worth participating in. I'm not even a fan of those types of boxes. But I don't see any reason to go around telling others that they shouldn't be playing that either. When it comes to terminology, they're words without inherent meaning. The meaning comes from context. When we talk about letterboxes, the context the term is used might refer to "real letterboxes," or it might refer to "non-real letterboxes," or it might even refer to "anything with a stamp."<br/>
<br/>
Just like a conversation about bears might be referring to polar bears, or black bears, or grizzly bears, or panda bears, or maybe all of the above. By itself, the term "bear" is meaningless. In context, it could mean any number of things. Consider how ridiculous a conversation would sound if we replaced the term "letterbox" with "bear."<br/>
<br/>
"These aren't letterboxes. They're postals, and virtuals, and I don't understand why some people use the term letterbox. They're stamp collections (imagine a tone of disgust), not letterboxes (imagine a tone of respect)."<br/>
<br/>
"These aren't bears. They're pandas, and grizzlies, and I don't understand why some people use the term bear. They're ANIMALS (imagine a tone of disgust), not bears (imagine a tone of respect)."<br/>
<br/>
Instead of being ungrateful for a website most people here probably don't use, why don't you send a thank you to the webmasters on LbNA thanking them for creating a website that you can enjoy and supports your point of view. AQ is just full of a bunch of Al-Queda operatives and doesn't deserve all the attention you give it. =)<br/>

I am a newbie but I have fairly high standards for myself in terms of how I play  -  I realize there are a lot of very very causal boxes out there (who look up a box on a Saturday for a family outing because there is nothing else to do)  and I think that is fine.  However I also have been finding a lot of boxes just out in the open lately or (the horror) not closed! I don't know if this is inexperience or just because I am the first person finding these boxes after the winter snow melt.  I feel like its disrespectful to the planter but its a risk that's taken every time we plant a box - a risk knowingly taken.  I don't think its as easy to apreciate the importance of rehiding a box well  until you start planting yourself (although I have always enjoyed rehideing the box really really well (tee hee).  I also like a BIT of a challenge when looking for a box I think I should have to do more than scan the area and see the box outright.  <br/>

Everyone has there own way of letterboxing. There are no rules as to what a "real" letterbox is. To some it is a drive by for handicap reasons. To some it is that long hike, to some it is the stamp itself, or location. Whatever the reason there is no wrong or right way to box. Except of course after finding it you rehide it better than you found it. Which we have been finding a problem lately. After reading these posts the past few days I am finding there are a lot of LB snobs! If I was a new boxer I would be very discouraged to even want to become part of this hobby. So that could be the reason Why So Quiet?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Very well put... it is letterboxers who changed the game and each of us has<br/>
&gt; &gt; the choice of whether to buy into the changes or not.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That being said, I do feel that choosing not to buy in, choosing to play in<br/>
&gt; &gt; a more traditional way, has become more difficult due to lack of like-minded<br/>
&gt; &gt; individuals.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Several years ago, there were far fewer letterboxes in my area, but the<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes that were being planted for the most part involved a hike and had<br/>
&gt; &gt; clues of a much higher challenge than most I see now. Likewise, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxers playing the game at that time thought nothing of spending an<br/>
&gt; &gt; entire Saturday afternoon hiking a few miles and nabbing 1-2 boxes. Now<br/>
&gt; &gt; those boxes on longer hikes, often with quality clues, languish unfound for<br/>
&gt; &gt; months/years because there are handfuls of boxes easily found on the edges<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the parking lot. Sure, these people *could* choose to ignore the gimme<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes in the parking lot and head off down the trail for a nice hike with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; box at the end of some challenging clues... but I am not seeing that so<br/>
&gt; &gt; much, rather there has been a mentality shift that more boxes is better,<br/>
&gt; &gt; regardless of the quality of the box, the clues and the location.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Even though there is nothing forcing me to buy into that mentality, it is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bit lonely playing a game alone.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps it was a bunch of well meaning articles that said..... look at<br/>
&gt; &gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; secret game. hey, wasn't the key work secret? letterboxers changed the<br/>
&gt; &gt; game.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we changed it by calling attention to ourselves and then not teaching the<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; reading and researching part.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; so now we have changes that aren't traditional letterboxing. such as<br/>
&gt; &gt; postals<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ltc's and virtuals. ask yourself, does this really change letterboxing? i<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; can tell you it doesn't for me. i do postals, have dabbled in ltc's and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; couple of virtuals. none of these take the place of letterboxing. none of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them take the place of the hike or the thrill of cracking that extra hard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; clue.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; i have been letterboxing now for 8 years and the game, for me, has not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; changed. i am the one that chooses which boxes i will look for. i am the<br/>
&gt; &gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that chooses where i will go. i am the one that will ultimately enjoy the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; journey. i am responsible for the quality (or lack there of) of my plants<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and clues. i am the only one that can change the game for me, and i don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; plan on changing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; now all of the rant above does not mean i am not concerned about the<br/>
&gt; &gt; trends<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; i see. the poor plants, the kindergarten clues (hey, i was there once<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; what i do believe is that those who are not serious about the game will<br/>
