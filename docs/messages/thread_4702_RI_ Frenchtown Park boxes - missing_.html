today (total of 18 plus 1 HH)...she heads for home<br/>
tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
We ended at the Frenchtown Park boxes that Trish<br/>
planted.  The one up in Frye Family Preserve was<br/>
fine..thought the hike was quite a bit further than we<br/>
had anticipated from the clues.  <br/>
<br/>
After returning to the car for the second sheet of the<br/>
clues that we had forgotten (and a short cut drive to<br/>
the rec department ;o) ), we attempted to search out<br/>
the box at the mill.  All we managed to find, however,<br/>
was a ton of high schoolers smoking and huffing, and a<br/>
group of Johnson and Wales Geocachers.  Neither they<br/>
or us had any luck in our hunts.  The teens told the<br/>
geocachers that they had found a box a while ago, but<br/>
down the trail a ways from where we thought it was<br/>
suppose to be.<br/>
<br/>
Trish, we are pretty sure that we were in the right<br/>
spot, but we looked all over.  If you want to email me<br/>
specifics as to where the box is, maybe I can confirm<br/>
if that is where we checked.  <br/>
<br/>
I will send another message to the board with updates<br/>
on the other boxes we found in our journey. <br/>
