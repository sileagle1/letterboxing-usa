                    <div class="plaintext-content">Went letterboxing today to get the last stamp we needed from Lake <br/>
Anna State Park in Spotsylvania, Virginia. Want to know how to turn <br/>
a .8 mile hike with 3 kids in to a 2 hour search? Try following the <br/>
directions to the "over the river and through the woods" LB while <br/>
looking at the parks trail map. It seems the section of trail this <br/>
book is on with the little wooden bridge, was actually put in after <br/>
the maps were made and no updated maps have come out. <br/>
<br/>
It was really kinda funny today. The kids and I were determined to <br/>
find this box and we were not giving up. We finally decided to go to <br/>
the park office and ask about the little wooden bridge, not far from <br/>
the Elfien trail. The poor park ranger looked at me like I had lost <br/>
my mind. First off they have no Elfien trail. LOL, and second she had <br/>
no idea what little bridge I was talking about. So I said, it's were <br/>
the mountain laurels grow. She then informed me that Mountain Laurel <br/>
grew all over the park, so that didn't help any. I said ok, what <br/>
about a Blue Coconut hanging in a tree. No she hadn't seen any of <br/>
those either. About that time another Ranger came in from a back <br/>
office and asked me if I had said something about a blue coconut. I <br/>
told him I had and he said they had been taken down last fall. I <br/>
asked if he remember where they were and he did. He then asked if I <br/>
was geocaching or on some other type of treasure hunt. Well, at first <br/>
I didn't know what to say, then I figured I better tell the truth. So <br/>
I explained to the now three Rangers all about Letterboxing and even <br/>
mentioned how the state parks in CT promoted it. They loved the idea <br/>
and thought it was great that their park had some of these boxes. Of <br/>
course they had no problem with anyone planting another box in the <br/>
park as long as they stopped by the park office first and informed <br/>
someone what they were putting out, and perhaps supply a copy of the <br/>
clues to the box. Just in case. Then I got the spill on nuts and how <br/>
you never know what others may decide to leave in a park and in the <br/>
event of a terror attack, it's always nice to know whats hidden in <br/>
the woods and where. Also if a problem came up with one of the boxes <br/>
they wanted a contact person.  He finished by telling me that <br/>
probably 5 years down the road someone from the higher office of Park <br/>
Rangers would send out a memo to get them to promote letterboxing, <br/>
and they would be 5 years ahead of the time! He sounded almost proud <br/>
when he said that! <br/>
<br/>
To end, with the now new help from the Rangers, I found the LB about <br/>
10 mins after leaving the office. Happy, hot and tired we loaded back <br/>
into the van and headed home with our new stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Happy LBing!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's wonderful.  It is always a game of chance on how park <br/>
officials will respond to news of our hobby being carried out in <br/>
their park.  I hope they will tell all their Ranger friends that <br/>
this is a wonderful and beign occupation.  My experience with park <br/>
directors in Connecticut has been all positive.  (I have not gone <br/>
into any national parks.)  They all see the oppertunity to attract a <br/>
new audience of visitors.  One is planning to put out "official" <br/>
park boxes as part of the educational outreach.<br/>
<br/>
It is a good idea to inform the directors of the boxes in case a <br/>
question comes up.  I would hate to see the bomb squad being called <br/>
to defuse a rubber stamp.  (I think this may have happened.)<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the good work.  Lets hope all directors are so inclined.<br/>
