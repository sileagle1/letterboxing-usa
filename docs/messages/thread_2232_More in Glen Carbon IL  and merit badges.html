Hi.  Hid these two today.<br/>
<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
By the way.  Just picked up and mailed the merit badges that had been <br/>
ordered.  I think they look good ... though not as awesome as the Logo <br/>
patches.  I noticed that they take a little extra time to sew on.  :o)    Let <br/>
me know how you like them<br/>
<br/>
I'm still taking orders since the one time set up fee wasn't quite covered.  <br/>
If anyone takes a good photo of them maybe they could post them for everyone <br/>
to see.<br/>
<br/>
:-)<br/>
Thanks,  Mohmers<br/>
