Yep.  A good rule of thumb in e-mail is to ignore messages if you don't know <blockquote type="CITE"><br/>
who the sender is.<br/>

The following is somewhat off-topic, but, at least to me, somewhat <br/>
interesting.  It came across another list I subscribe to (where alledged<br/>
censorship vs spam remediation is a hot topic (and an important one, as<br/>
the list is of such a nature that the moderators, I believe, can be held<br/>
liable under anti-trust law for censorship)).  You certainly don't have to<br/>
read it, but the gist is that the proper (and only logical) response to <br/>
unwanted e-mail (be it spam or "hate" or that which offends) is to ignore <br/>
it.  (I don't totally agree with that thesis, but I mostly do -- the <br/>
underlying structure of the thesis is basically right, tho I may not agree <br/>
with some word choice, details, and exceptions.  Anyway, someone else's  <br/>
words, not mine, so don't flame me ... <br/>

A large part of "SPAM" is not a matter of marketing. It is a matter of<br/>
terrorism, where instead of violence, they conduct annoyance.  ....</blockquote><br/>

<blockquote type="CITE">When someone is trying to annoy you, the correct response is not to be<br/>
