Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Amy Mcintire and I live in Columbus, Ohio. I am very <br/>
interested in this Letterboxing exploring and fun. I am planning on <br/>
going to try a couple of these in my area...they sound like so much <br/>
fun to do. I am a rubberstamp/scrapbook artist...I found the link to <br/>
the Letterboxing site by another Yahoo group that I am a member of <br/>
(I cannot recall which one at the moment).<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I am unable to make the October 16th Ohio <br/>
gathering....however, I am interested in joining anyone in doing any <br/>
of the Ohio treks(esp. in the Columbus area). Please feel free to e-<br/>
mail me at amyscrapdiva@yahoo.com :)Also, pleas keep me abreast of <br/>
any Ohio gatherings - thanks!<br/>
<br/>
I would love to get to know all of you soon!<br/>
<br/>
Amy<br/>
