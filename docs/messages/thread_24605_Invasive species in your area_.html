My question to you and why is has your local parks and rec organization <br/>
or town government made you aware of invasive plant species and why it <br/>
is impotant to erraticate them. I ask this as I didn't even know there <br/>
was an issue until I read a brochour that was placed in the kiosk of a <br/>
local preserve.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxers, being outdoor and looking through the woods are ideal in <br/>
keeping an eye on these pests in out local parks and preserves. <br/>
<br/>
Just want to know if there word is getting out.<br/>

If you happen to run across drip tubing while hiking/letterboxing just <br/>
leave the area ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
Then notify your local agency.<br/>

I have recently, actually indirectly through letterboxing, become <br/>

resposibilites that we have to to keep a look out for invasive plant <br/>
species, in fact we have a list of five that we really monitor. <br/>
<br/>
