DATE:  9/30/02<br/>
STATE/COUNTY:  New Hampshire/Rockingham<br/>
Nearest Town:  Newington, NH<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:  To find this hidden treasure on the "e-coast", Take Exit <br/>
1 off the Spaulding Turnpike to PEASE INTERNATIONAL TRADEPORT; <br/>
continue straight after entering until the road ends and takea right; <br/>
follow the (sparse) signs for the Great Bay Refuge (about 3.5 <br/>
miles).  After entering the refuge, continue on to the parking lot on <br/>
the left.<br/>
<br/>
TAKE REFUGE 1 is located on  the Peverly Pond Trail.  It's about .5 <br/>
mile round trip; easy; sorry no dogs/bikes; open sunrise to sunset <br/>
all year; free; snowboarding in winter; restrooms.  This trail is <br/>
great for kids.  Early morning and late afternoon = best time.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  Follow trail past 3 boardwalks and 2 benches.  Just past the <br/>
second bench, there's a fence. At that fence, take a right to nearly <br/>
the water's edge... Facing the water, to your left will be a log and <br/>
the box should be under it about midpoint.  Please leave box as you <br/>
found it.  Thanks and Happy hunting!  Follow trail signs to exit.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you're up for it, go on to TAKE REFUGE 2!<br/>
<br/>
After getting to the parking lot, cross the street to the Ferry Way <br/>
Trail.  It's 2 mi. round trip; about 1 hour; fairly easy; (same as <br/>
above).  The trail is easily wide enough for a stroller, however <br/>
quite bumpy.    <br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  Follow the asphalt path adjacent to the chain link fence; <br/>
cross the dirt road; veer to the left.  After passing the beaver <br/>
ponds and across from the apple orchard is a double tree with a huge <br/>
split in the middle.  Take the first path after that tree, have a <br/>
seat and looking to the left an overwhelmingly tall pine tree. <br/>
Ducking under and behind, you should find the box.  Please leave as <br/>
found.  Thanks and happy hunting!!         <br/>
