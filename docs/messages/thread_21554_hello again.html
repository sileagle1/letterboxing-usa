I think that eli asked me about where i live and it is los Angeles <br/>
and i think it was Q that asked about the first letterbox i found <br/>
and i have been trying to find it on the letterboxing sight and i <br/>
can't find it.The letterbox was located under the sw corner of a <br/>
brown storage bin at the intersection of western canyon and west <br/>
observatory road. The name was something mystery and i can't find it <br/>
at the letterbox listing. I told Q that i could show the letterbox <br/>
at the los Angeles picnic so maybe then somebody can figure out the <br/>
name. I have collected some more finds too . This is sure fun.<br/>
