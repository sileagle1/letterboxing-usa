displayed for clues linked outside of LBNA.  It normally<br/>
would just have the link for the off site clue, but if <br/>
you do like me and cut and paste the clues in LBNA in<br/>
addition to linking to an offsite clue page, those clues<br/>
will show up in addition to the link.  This could be<br/>
confusing since these clues are not necessarily updated<br/>
like the linked clue page is, so be sure to always go<br/>
to the link for the most up to date clues.  The reason<br/>
I do this is for backup, so if my clue pages get deleted<br/>
there will still be some clues available.<br/>

&gt; There were a few minor changes made to the LbNA website today. Yell <br/>
if<br/>
&gt; you spot any problems. Notable changes are 1) next/previous buttons <br/>
at<br/>
&gt; the bottom of clue pages to make it easier to go through a list, and<br/>
&gt; 2) check box in BoxAdd page to confirm you comply with LbNA Terms of <br/>
Use.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One thing that might be a little strange with the next/previous links<br/>
&gt; is that when you use one and the letterbox that you go to has it's<br/>
&gt; clues linked outside of LbNA, you'll see a dummy page with the link<br/>
&gt; and have to click on the link to the off site clues.<br/>
