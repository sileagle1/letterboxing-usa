. . . Enough of that.<br/>
<br/>
Since I learn and see so many new things thru LB'g, I just wanted<br/>
to <br/>
expand on what I have learned about Haikus  but the details are<br/>
many <br/>
so just jump on over to <br/>
http://www.toyomasu.com/haiku/#whatishaiku<br/>
 for the history and types of poems.  The weird part is no rhyme! How <br/>
beat is that?!<br/>
<br/>
So here is my attempt:<br/>
<br/>
Learn LetterBoxing<br/>
Experience outdoor things<br/>
Post group about it.<br/>
<br/>
And before we flood the message board with poems, I have opened a <br/>
FILE/FOLDER "Happy Haikus To You". Feel free to post yours (at least <br/>
I hope posting can be done by anyone?!?) If not, let me know, I'll <br/>
try and figure out how it is suppose to work.<br/>
