Turtle Trail Series<br/>
Dana Peak Park<br/>
Harker Heights, TX<br/>
Bell County<br/>
Placed: 22 Dec 02 (updated clues on 5 April 2003 by<br/>

Difficulty: Medium<br/>
Time: 45 minutes<br/>
<br/>
Dana Peak is located in Harker Heights, TX. To get to<br/>
the start point from I-35, take US 190 West and exit<br/>
FM 2410 East. (There are two exits to FM 2410, take<br/>
the one in Harker Heights, and not the one to<br/>
Stillhouse Park)  Continue East for 3.5 miles and turn<br/>
right onto Commanche Gap (Follow the sign to "Dana<br/>
Peak").  Continue 2.5 miles, while you pass the "Goats<br/>
for Sale," and park at the bend in the road with the<br/>
gate leading to a large path. This is the start point.<br/>
<br/>
Mama Turtle<br/>
Pass the gate and walk up the hill and then down the<br/>
hill towards Stillhouse Hollow Lake.  You will pass a<br/>
trail crossing, continue straight at 80 degrees,<br/>
towards the hills across the water.  When you are<br/>
walking on lake-level, you will come to a dead end<br/>
with a choice to go left or right?  Follow the trail<br/>
at 10 degrees.  The next trail marker you see will<br/>
have a faint painting of a Turtle T-2 on it, follow<br/>
it straight.  This will lead you around the water.  At<br/>
the next trail marker, go straight.<br/>
<br/>
You will then come to a Turtle T-2 trail marker,<br/>
follow path to the right of this trail marker at 110<br/>
degrees.  Follow the next Turtle T-2 trail marker to<br/>
the right  (From here you would go left to find the<br/>
Patriotic Pug Letterbox).  At a Y continue to the<br/>
right.  The next Turtle T-2 will lead you to the<br/>
left up the hill.  Follow the trail uphill, it will be<br/>
a little steep at times.  Follow Turtle T-2 left up<br/>
4, then 7 steps.  Continue up the trail.<br/>
<br/>
When the trail peaks, you will see a deer trail up to<br/>
the actual peak, which is topped with large boulders<br/>
(and a great view).  When standing at the base of the<br/>
deer trail, look at 20 degrees and you will see a<br/>
medium-sized boulder (downhill).  On the downhill<br/>
(North) side of the boulder, look under a small rock<br/>
pile and you will find Mama Turtle.  Please stamp<br/>
her in your book so that you can reunite her with her<br/>
baby.<br/>
<br/>
Baby Turtle<br/>
After youve stamped Mama Turtle, head back up to<br/>
the trail.  Continue down the trail in the direction<br/>
you were heading.  Go down 7 steps.  Stand on the 7th<br/>
step.  At 30 degrees, you will see a dead, split tree<br/>
with a cactus on top.  At the base of the tree is<br/>
Baby Turtle.  Please stamp him in your book to<br/>
reunite him with his Mama.<br/>
<br/>
You may either continue down the path or head back the<br/>
way you came (which might be the shorter way back). <br/>
If you continue, you will head through some woods,<br/>
follow the Turtle T-2 arrows to find yourself along<br/>
the water and back to where you began.  The trek is a<br/>
little long, so I ride my mountain bike, but it would<br/>
be a nice afternoon hike also.<br/>
