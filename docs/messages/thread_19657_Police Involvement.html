                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had a horrible first experience with letterboxing. I came across <br/>
the website because I was looking up a local park I had never <br/>
noticed before. My search brought me directly to www.letterboxing.org<br/>
<br/>
I was so excited to begin that I packed up my two daughters (both <br/>
under 2 years old) this past tuesday morning and we went hunting for <br/>
a letterbox that was supposedly at the park right next to our house. <br/>
We walked to the park and began looking. While in the wooded area I <br/>
had my grandmother on the phone because I don't like going into <br/>
wooded areas alone. While talking to her on the phone four 8 year <br/>
old boys came up to me and asked me what I was doing. I told them I <br/>
was looking for a box. They asked me what it looked like and I told <br/>
them I didn't know. They said they knew where a box was. I hung up <br/>
with my grandmother and followed them to the box. It was exactly <br/>
what I was looking for! I thought it was so cool! I even let the <br/>
boys fingerprint the pad of paper since they didn't have stamps. I <br/>
asked if I could take their picture for my scrapbook and they said <br/>
yes. After I stamped we went out of the woods and played on the <br/>
playground, just me and my daughters. Well, the boys were part of a <br/>
parks and rec daycare like thing. One of the counslers came up and <br/>
asked me what I was doing. I told him all about letterboxing and <br/>
even gave him the website. He seemed cool with it. <br/>
<br/>
The story continues, I returned to the park today just for play. My <br/>
daughter loves to swing there. Well, the counsler came up to me <br/>
again and said that some parents complained. I gave him my name and <br/>
number and said the parents could call me if they wanted and I'd <br/>
destroy the picture. Well, I guess they had the police come to the <br/>
park Tuesday afternoon (just hours after I had left). I can't <br/>
believe it! I took a friend over this afternoon because she wanted <br/>
to start letterboxing (she read the article in Time). We went there <br/>
and the box was missing. I'm assuming the police took it. <br/>
<br/>
Does this happen often? I am mortified! I can't believe how awful <br/>
the parents and police are acting. I'm hoping they'll see the <br/>
website and realize it's all innocent. However, I'm so afraid <br/>
they'll see the site and remove all of the letterboxes in the area:<br/>

<br/>
I'm sorry to hear about your experience.  When I box, I try to never tell <br/>
anyone what I'm doing.  Many people outside of the sport don't understand the <br/>
sport, so I feel as though it's better to just keep quiet.  Also, I wouldn't take <br/>
pictures of people you don't know, especially children.  Without the parents' <br/>
consent, even if the children give consent, the parents may go totally insane <br/>
over the fact that a stranger has taken their picture.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, the police won't pull all of the boxes in the area.  I'd contact <br/>
the placers directly (using the contact placer button on the website clues) in <br/>
the area to tell them about the problem and to have them periodically check on <br/>
their boxes.  That way, they can post if the boxes have gone missing.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  I hope you keep boxing!<br/>

I'm NEVER taking pictures of anyone I don't know again. I just <br/>
thought it would be cool since they're the ones who helped me find <br/>
my first letterbox. Never again though! I'll just take pictures of <br/>
the box and my family from now on. I swear! Also, I won't tell <br/>
anyone what I'm doing. If I would have just told the kids I was <br/>
looking at flowers I'm sure none of this would have happened. Thanks <br/>
for the advice!<br/>

&gt;   I totally understand your point. I'd be upset too, but the boys <br/>
came <br/>
&gt;   up to me. I had no idea they were with parks and rec and even <br/>
though <br/>
&gt;   they were I totally spoke with the counsler before the parents <br/>
got <br/>
&gt;   involved. He told the parents that everything was fine and he <br/>
told <br/>
&gt;   them about me and everything. But they still brought the cops <br/>
over. <br/>
&gt;   Ok, even that I don't mind. But to remove the box??? Now I feel <br/>
like <br/>
&gt;   it's my fault and it's totally not! I feel awful that I ruined <br/>
&gt;   someones box placement. I don't even care that the parents are <br/>
&gt;   upset, I'm more upset that someones notebook was taken away:(<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Not to mention that the counslers were playing hide and seek <br/>
with <br/>
&gt;   the kids. They told the kids to go hide in the woods and they'd <br/>
come <br/>
&gt;   find them. I'd be more worried about that if I were the <br/>
parents...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I'm wondering what the proper thing to do is. Should I replace <br/>
the <br/>
&gt;   box myself? I've already contacted the the person who originally <br/>
&gt;   placed the box.<br/>

&gt;   www.letterboxing.org<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; I was so excited to begin that I packed up my two daughters <br/>
(both <br/>
&gt;   &gt; under 2 years old) this past tuesday morning and we went <br/>
hunting <br/>
&gt;   for <br/>
&gt;   &gt; a letterbox that was supposedly at the park right next to our <br/>
&gt;   house. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; We walked to the park and began looking. While in the wooded <br/>
area <br/>
&gt;   I <br/>
&gt;   &gt; had my grandmother on the phone because I don't like going <br/>
into <br/>
&gt;   &gt; wooded areas alone. While talking to her on the phone four 8 <br/>
year <br/>
&gt;   &gt; old boys came up to me and asked me what I was doing. I told <br/>
them <br/>
&gt;   I <br/>
&gt;   &gt; was looking for a box. They asked me what it looked like and I <br/>
&gt;   told <br/>
&gt;   &gt; them I didn't know. They said they knew where a box was. I <br/>
hung up <br/>
&gt;   &gt; with my grandmother and followed them to the box. It was <br/>
exactly <br/>
&gt;   &gt; what I was looking for! I thought it was so cool! I even let <br/>
the <br/>
&gt;   &gt; boys fingerprint the pad of paper since they didn't have <br/>
stamps. I <br/>
&gt;   &gt; asked if I could take their picture for my scrapbook and they <br/>
said <br/>
&gt;   &gt; yes. After I stamped we went out of the woods and played on <br/>
the <br/>
&gt;   &gt; playground, just me and my daughters. Well, the boys were part <br/>
of <br/>
&gt;   a <br/>
&gt;   &gt; parks and rec daycare like thing. One of the counslers came up <br/>
and <br/>
&gt;   &gt; asked me what I was doing. I told him all about letterboxing <br/>
and <br/>
&gt;   &gt; even gave him the website. He seemed cool with it. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; The story continues, I returned to the park today just for <br/>
play. <br/>
&gt;   My <br/>
&gt;   &gt; daughter loves to swing there. Well, the counsler came up to <br/>
me <br/>
&gt;   &gt; again and said that some parents complained. I gave him my <br/>
name <br/>
&gt;   and <br/>
&gt;   &gt; number and said the parents could call me if they wanted and <br/>
I'd <br/>
&gt;   &gt; destroy the picture. Well, I guess they had the police come to <br/>
the <br/>
&gt;   &gt; park Tuesday afternoon (just hours after I had left). I can't <br/>
&gt;   &gt; believe it! I took a friend over this afternoon because she <br/>
wanted <br/>
&gt;   &gt; to start letterboxing (she read the article in Time). We went <br/>
&gt;   there <br/>
&gt;   &gt; and the box was missing. I'm assuming the police took it. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Does this happen often? I am mortified! I can't believe how <br/>
awful <br/>
&gt;   &gt; the parents and police are acting. I'm hoping they'll see the <br/>
&gt;   &gt; website and realize it's all innocent. However, I'm so afraid <br/>
&gt;   &gt; they'll see the site and remove all of the letterboxes in the <br/>
area:<br/>
&gt;   &gt; (  <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; This is not stopping me from letterboxing. We had so much fun!<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; What can/should I do???? <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Thanks!<br/>

I just wanted to comment on this part.<br/>
<br/>
It's different in a lot of other countries, but in the U.S., one never ever  <br/>
wants to take any photos of minors without getting parental permission first,  <br/>
preferably in writing.  It can create a boatload of problems for the  <br/>
photographer if a parent (or any other adult in the area) decides  to object.  You <br/>
were lucky the police just took you at your word that  you'd destroy the <br/>
negative and let it go at that.  <br/>
<br/>
With my photography work, I'm very very careful nowadays.   Photographing <br/>
minors has become a serious issue in today's world.  No  matter how innocent it <br/>
might be on the part of the photographer when it happens,  the parents have no <br/>
way of knowing that for sure.   <br/>
<br/>
A pedophile could place a box near a children's camp just for the  purpose of <br/>
either luring children into the woods, or to take photos of  children.   <br/>
Possibly whoever placed the box didn't realize there would  be a daycare taking <br/>
place in such close vicinity to where they placed the  box.  <br/>
<br/>
So both on a "take no photos of minors" front and on a "pedophiles do  things <br/>
like lure children away so that they can abduct them" front, both the  <br/>
counselors responsible for the care of the children and the parents of those  <br/>
children could understandably be expected to be somewhat anxious and  upset.<br/>

<br/>
While I understand the parents' concern,  seems to me they should be a bit<br/>
more worried that their children who were supposedly in some sort of rec<br/>
program were wandering around and talking to strangers!!<br/>
<br/>
Also, don't assume the police took the box--it is possible that some one<br/>
else happened upon it; if the boys found it, so could someone else, or one<br/>
of their buddies etc etc.  I think the advice to contact the placer is good.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the world of letterboxing--as you have learned it is a hobby best<br/>
practiced discreetly.  I hope this  experience wasn't too horrendous and<br/>
that you continue to grow in the sport.<br/>

<br/>
While you certainly meant no harm, the fact is, it sort of is your <br/>
fault.  Put yourself in those parents' position- wouldn't you want <br/>
to insure that your children's image &amp; fingerprints were <br/>
confiscated?  Some debate has been lofted about today about elitists <br/>
&amp; snobs, but the fact is, that the general public, even with the <br/>
help of TIME &amp; CNN do not know about letterboxing, nor do they <br/>
care.  However, should they stumble upon a box, some unfortunate <br/>
soles are likely to be unkind to the boxes- like your police <br/>
officers.  Your harmless hobby is their predator's tool.  It's <br/>
always best to be discreet, keep to yourself &amp; enjoy the hobby with <br/>
friends &amp; family.  Should you find a fellow boxer on the trail, <br/>
fabulous! But most people out there, however kind they may seem, may <br/>
not be out there boxing.  Consider it a lesson learned for the first <br/>
time out &amp; hopefully all your future experiences will be stress-free <br/>
&amp; full of fun! Hang in there!<br/>
<br/>
For the record, whenever we box, I cannot help but think of poor <br/>
Elmer Fudd tromping through the forest whispering "Shhh... we're <br/>
hunting wabbits..."<br/>

&gt; &gt; We walked to the park and began looking. While in the wooded <br/>
area <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; &gt; had my grandmother on the phone because I don't like going into <br/>
&gt; &gt; wooded areas alone. While talking to her on the phone four 8 <br/>
year <br/>
&gt; &gt; old boys came up to me and asked me what I was doing. I told <br/>
them <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; &gt; was looking for a box. They asked me what it looked like and I <br/>
&gt; told <br/>
&gt; &gt; them I didn't know. They said they knew where a box was. I hung <br/>
up <br/>
&gt; &gt; with my grandmother and followed them to the box. It was exactly <br/>
&gt; &gt; what I was looking for! I thought it was so cool! I even let the <br/>
&gt; &gt; boys fingerprint the pad of paper since they didn't have stamps. <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; &gt; asked if I could take their picture for my scrapbook and they <br/>
said <br/>
&gt; &gt; yes. After I stamped we went out of the woods and played on the <br/>
&gt; &gt; playground, just me and my daughters. Well, the boys were part <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; parks and rec daycare like thing. One of the counslers came up <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; asked me what I was doing. I told him all about letterboxing and <br/>
&gt; &gt; even gave him the website. He seemed cool with it. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The story continues, I returned to the park today just for play. <br/>
&gt; My <br/>
&gt; &gt; daughter loves to swing there. Well, the counsler came up to me <br/>
&gt; &gt; again and said that some parents complained. I gave him my name <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; number and said the parents could call me if they wanted and I'd <br/>
&gt; &gt; destroy the picture. Well, I guess they had the police come to <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; park Tuesday afternoon (just hours after I had left). I can't <br/>
&gt; &gt; believe it! I took a friend over this afternoon because she <br/>
wanted <br/>
&gt; &gt; to start letterboxing (she read the article in Time). We went <br/>
&gt; there <br/>
&gt; &gt; and the box was missing. I'm assuming the police took it. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Does this happen often? I am mortified! I can't believe how <br/>
awful <br/>
&gt; &gt; the parents and police are acting. I'm hoping they'll see the <br/>
&gt; &gt; website and realize it's all innocent. However, I'm so afraid <br/>
&gt; &gt; they'll see the site and remove all of the letterboxes in the <br/>
area:<br/>
&gt; &gt; (  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This is not stopping me from letterboxing. We had so much fun!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; What can/should I do???? <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>

bunch of eight-yr.-olds loose in the woods. Had they checked the woods beforehand <br/>
to make sure there weren't any "nasties" lurking? Obviously, the kids weren't being <br/>
"sought" very actively if they had time to stamp in with you.<br/>

however, [even at risk of being flamed, I must love my feet close to<br/>
the fire ooh hotter!!] I don't live in a state where there are many<br/>
letterboxers but I have often not hidden my activites and shared with<br/>
hikers etc what it is that I am doing.  It is true that I size them up<br/>
first and feel it out but I am trying to get more people involved and<br/>
as many people have said on this list, the best way to do that is to<br/>
actually letterbox with them.  I tend to believe that most people are<br/>
good at heart and not dishonest, else how would e-bay survive?<br/>
<br/>
As to the boys, yeah I guess that maybe it could seem scary to the<br/>
parents but really, what camp counsler should be sending 8 year old<br/>
boys into the woods to play hide and go seek in a public park?  I am<br/>
also  guessing that by your name you are female and you stated that<br/>
you were accompanied by your very young daughters, which as a parent I<br/>
would immediately consider you harmless and besides how many convicted<br/>
pedophiles have been female?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just to throw my 2-cents in here too, I agree with what Kerri wrote.  Having worked as a camp counselor at a day camp in the past, as a parent (if I were a parent) I'd also be upset that the kids were allowed to wander away, unsupervised, and I'd be thankful that the stranger they came up to was friendly with no ill intentions.  It almost sounds to me, with the police getting involved, that they were looking for a scapegoat instead of placing the blame with the counselors who let the kids wander.  I can completey understand - was it Jeni? - telling those kids what she was doing, though.  I mean, when you run into adults on the trail, chances are unless they're a 'boxer they won't "get it" and to protect the secrecy aspect you tell them you're on a nature hike, you're taking photos, or my favorite, you start making out with your boyfriend ;)  But when 3 little boys come up all, "Hi!  What are you doing?" and eagerness on their faces it's harder not to let them in on the fun.<br/>
<br/>
Fingerprints...I remember that there was a discussion a few months ago as to wether fingerprints were acceptable as a "signature stamp."  I think someone created a poll about it.<br/>

That's all...<br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>
