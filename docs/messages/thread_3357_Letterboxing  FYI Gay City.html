<br/><blockquote type="CITE">Hi Donna,
<br/>
<br/>I took my MCTC orienteering class to Gay City today.  Jon Howes has put out permanent controls so I used them for our exercise.  Our O course ended near the letterbox under the rock with the quartz vein.  Therefore, we also did some letterboxing (I guess).  I could use the O map to follow the route described to find the letterbox.
<br/>
<br/>When we opened the box, we discovered that all the contents were soggy wet.  Is there any way to notify the letterbox maintainer that the booklet probably should be replaced or, at least put out in the sun to dry out?
<br/>
<br/>What do you do for the three hours in your class?  Do you choose a letterbox that has a long hike to find it?  Interestingly, I could have used the O map to find a much faster route to get to the cache :-)
