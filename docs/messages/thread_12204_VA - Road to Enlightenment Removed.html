<br/>
We really enjoyed hunting for these leterboxbooks.  You all have a great <br/>
sense of humor!<br/>
<br/>
We will miss you when you move!  BeMa<br/>

P.S.  Isn't it interesting that the patrons tried to check out the books <br/>
without looking inside?!  From the outside they look like books, but, the <br/>
moment you open them up!...<br/>
