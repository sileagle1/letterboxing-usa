&gt;About Promotion:<br/>
&gt;I am in  agreement that we need to take a proactive approach to growing<br/>
&gt;this hobby...<br/>
&gt;...collectively develop some helpful "aids" to share among us, perhaps<br/>
&gt;accessed only by folks on the list, but not visable to the web page<br/>
&gt;generally?<br/>
<br/>
This would be easy to do.  Quite often I will send a link<br/>
to the list like this:<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/resource.htm<br/>
The page this link points to is not advertised, very unlikely anyone<br/>
will<br/>
stumble upon it.  This is a good method to use to do what Erik is<br/>
suggesting.<br/>
We just pass the links around via email.  Its no different than clipping<br/>
an<br/>
article and mailing it to someone via snail mail (though its a bit<br/>
faster),<br/>
and you never have to run to the copy place if you want to send out more<br/>
<br/>
than one copy.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;These might be for downloading/modifying/printing to pass<br/>
&gt;about as we as individuals see fit? I agree with the sentiments of keep<br/>
&gt;it simple and rubber-stampish, not glitzy or "commercial".<br/>
<br/>
I don't know where the idea of glitziness came from.  No one had<br/>
suggested that.  But...<br/>
As Mitch mentioned earlier you can put something together on a web page.<br/>
<br/>
It would print out nice but not be glitzy by any means.  It would be<br/>
readable<br/>
and usable but not particularly professional.  For example:<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/label.htm<br/>
This is just a simple label for a letterbox.  Once you have it up you<br/>
can print<br/>
it, cut and paste it, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I would think we could use colors and be artful without being glitzy.<br/>
The family type map at Plano, TX is really cool.<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/plano.htm#wdrfmap<br/>
I certainly don't think this is glitzy.  But it is nice.  Its attractive<br/>
and it says<br/>
something about who we are.<br/>

&gt;There are lots of local options for promotion, many of which have been<br/>
&gt;discussed, some done. Tom Cooch has already involved a library, and<br/>
some<br/>
&gt;of his students. My son and two friends want to bring it to cub<br/>
scouts.<br/>
&gt;These are the sorts of activities that build local 'critical mass'. So,<br/>
&gt;as we go forward, lets share experiences such as these that have (or<br/>
&gt;haven't) worked.<br/>
<br/>
I'm in full agreement with the local approach.  I think this is the best<br/>
way to<br/>
pass along information to the people in our respective areas (who we<br/>
stand<br/>
a chance to know and trust for one thing), and who can help us increase<br/>
the<br/>
number of boxes locally, thus increasing the fun.<br/>

Erik Davis finally wrote:<br/>
&gt;I don't feel that having clues on the net is the problem -<br/>
&gt;they have to be published someplace and, they can always be recopied<br/>
and<br/>
&gt;passed along - we really cannot hope to control whose hands they get to<br/>
&gt;forever.<br/>
<br/>
That's so true.  No matter how you do it you're going to have some<br/>
problems.  So<br/>
if the resolve is to not use the web to avoid problems you might as well<br/>
just<br/>
quit altogether.  There are many ways to use the web to our advantage<br/>
that<br/>
will not cause problems.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Erik for helping me to demystify this.<br/>
<br/>
The web actually is part of the fun and it is also a common work that we<br/>
can<br/>
share in.  I think it would be helpful to look on it as a common work,<br/>
or as<br/>
part of our artistic expression.  The maps themselves take on a bit of<br/>
art form.<br/>
Witness:<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/randolph.htm<br/>
Perhaps more of these types of layouts and maps will be put up...<br/>
<br/>
More and more I am finding constructive, useful and helpful things on<br/>
the web.<br/>
For sure that was my thinking with Letterbox USA.  What we are doing<br/>
(and what I defend) is making constructive and purposeful use of the web<br/>
<br/>
in a unique, shared system.  To my knowledge no one anywhere is sharing<br/>
in a vision quite like this one.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
I hope we are all resolved to make this work one way or another, and  to<br/>
<br/>
help insure that there will be some fun that everyone can enjoy<br/>
(including<br/>
us).<br/>
<br/>
I thank all of you who are helping with this effort.  I think it is<br/>
honorable<br/>
what we are doing.  And rest assured:  Its going to be a fruitful<br/>
project<br/>
curmudgeons or no curmudgeons.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
