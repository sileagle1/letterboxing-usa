I haven't heard anything recently about the Bush HH, so I presume he is still lingering in Mt Jackson-Goat Hoof Trellis box-- last placed by FamilyMan.  Bush HH must feel confident after the republican convention!!  It appears that Kerry remains in the lead, thanks to a great start by Judy B-sewsobizzy and friends.   But the race isn't over yet!!  Help move along the candidates as quickly as possible.<br/>
