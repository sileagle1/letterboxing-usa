I gave them the book/box so they would know what I was talking about. They deliberated for a week- even had a heads-of-staff meeting about it- but ultimately decided they didn't want to "be responsible for it" (even though I explained they wouldn't need to have anything to do with it, just keep it from getting checked out :-)<br/>
I then decided to try one of the smaller branch libraries closer to my home where I expected to get the same answer. After 5 minutes of speaking with the director of the library, she was not only happy to have the letterbook there, she was hooked on letterboxing! She's even gone boxing with her family on their vacation! <br/>
It doesn't hurt to ask, but you might have to ask at a few places :-)<br/>
I won't tell how/where in the library it's hidden though, you'll have to solve the clues for that :-)<br/>

Subject: Placing a letterbox in a library - Questions<br/>
<br/>
I am considering placing a letterbox in a library.<br/>
My questions:<br/>
If you have done this, have you sought permission before you planted?<br/>
<br/>
If you DID seek permission, did you provide the authorities with <br/>
examples of other libraries that have knowingly accepted letterboxes? <br/>
Did they ASK for names of libraries or librarians who have allowed <br/>
letterboxes in their libraries? If so, do you have suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Did you place the box in the stacks where that book would normally <br/>
have been shelved (i.e alpha order by author)? Or did you hide the <br/>
letterbox-book behind the shelved books?  Maybe you used a micro-box?<br/>
<br/>
Did you choose a book to adapt that would be less likely to be <br/>
examined (i.e. an older reference-type book vs. a best-seller so it <br/>
could hide in a less traveled part of a library?<br/>
<br/>
If the library director/administrator granted permission, did he/she <br/>
inform other staff about the letterbox-book?<br/>
<br/>
Among my concerns is that the library will see this as a PR <br/>
opportunity and make the whole thing a lot more public than I would <br/>
wish.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also considering a museum as a repository for a letterbox. Do you <br/>
have any experience with this? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing your experience (either to the list or off-line).<br/>

&gt; I have a 'letterbook' in a library. <br/>
<br/>
Mansfield, Ct will hopefully have letterbooks soon I will meet the <br/>
librarian next week if all goes as planned  then we will have more <br/>
snow day activities<br/>

<br/>
Mansfield( CT.) Historical Society Muesam has one. I have questions <br/>
for clues  from each of the exhibits so folks have to look around to <br/>
figure out how to get it. In the end they ask the docent and she has <br/>
it in the desk where you pay. Outside the muesam there is another <br/>
which is a little story of the buildings history ( Plane Spotter) and <br/>
down the trail a box dedicated to Bed Ruggs a colonial bed covering <br/>
featured in a book written by my mom and adding to the whole colonial <br/>
experience there. Lots of fun and the muesam appreciated the extra <br/>
folks dropping in.   Carol -Leader of the Pack<br/>
