Did you include the list of addresses in the package with the box? If so, it shouldn't be too hard to add people to the list if the person that has the box checks in before sending it on. I just want to be sure that I understand how you worked it. I'm inspired to begin work on my own postal box I'll let folks know when I'm ready to begin another list.<br/>

I'll field this one for Autumn just so you have a timely response to <br/>
your question. Yes, a list of names and addresses is provided inside <br/>
the postal lbox. A note also implores the finder to please post that <br/>
the box was received on the talk list. At this point I suppose people <br/>
could quickly request to be added to the address list, but that would <br/>
probably be at the goodwill of the finder. Some folks might just want <br/>
to send it along and not fuss with that, others may gladly add new <br/>
addresses to the list. <br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

Yep - the list of names/addresses went INSIDE the box.  So the only <br/>
way to get your name on the list now, is to determine WHO has the <br/>
box, and get on the list before it gets mailed away again.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the easiest thing to do would be to request that people post <br/>
here when they receive the box.  That way, it gives folks who are not <br/>
yet on the list an opportunity to email the current holder before <br/>
they mail it on. <br/>
<br/>
I still have the master list on my computer at home, so if you're <br/>
starting a new postal box, I can email it to you (I assume that <br/>
anyone who'd want my box, would probably want yours)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!  Check your letterbox soon, for a letterbox coming to you!!<br/>
