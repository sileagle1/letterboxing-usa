                    <div class="plaintext-content">I recently placed boxes near a stream and by a brook. I thought the <br/>
boxes would be safe if we got a lot of rain.<br/>
<br/>
The first box was placed under a fallen tree about thirty feet from a <br/>
stream no more than a few inches deep.  The box was about two feet <br/>
higher in elevation.<br/>
<br/>
The second box was placed on the bank of a brook but was about five <br/>
feet above the water level of the brook.<br/>
<br/>
Our area (Richmond, VA) got over 10 inches of rain during Tropical <br/>
Storm Gaston a few weeks ago.  Just about every river and low place <br/>
was flooded.  I was sure both my boxes were gone but I checked anyway.<br/>
<br/>
The first box ended up being under about three feet of water.  The <br/>
water dislodged the letterbox but fallen tree kept it from being <br/>
washed downstream.  It ended up about 10 feet away near the fallen <br/>
tree's stump.<br/>
<br/>
The second box ended up being under about 5 feet of water.  (So the <br/>
water level of the brook went from a few feet to over 15 feet.)  The <br/>
letterbox was still under the rock where I placed it but I had to dig <br/>
it out from all the mud and sand that settled there.<br/>
<br/>
Both boxes had some water in it but one of the logs stayed dry.  The <br/>
first box is back in it's place and the second was removed <br/>
temporarily because this part of the park was destroyed in the <br/>
flood.  It will be replaced when the park is in good condition.<br/>

P.S. The newspaper said it was a once in 5,900 year storm.  How they <br/>
figured that I don't know but I thought it was safe enough to leave <br/>
the boxes where they originially were located.<br/>
