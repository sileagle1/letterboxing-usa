I have been very busy with kayaking for a couple months now.  See my <br/>
homepage at www.qsl.net/ws8g for details.  <br/>
<br/>
I made a sweep of the Valley of the Frogs boxes yesterday.  (94 <br/>
degrees and high humidity)  I checked on all 30 boxes in the park and <br/>
two nearby.  <br/>
<br/>
3 are missing...  27 still in good shape.  <br/>
<br/>
Of the 3 Rediscovery boxes, the first has gone camping.  I will <br/>
likely put a replacement out when it gets a little cooler.<br/>
<br/>
Of the 3 ProtoTree frog boxes, the second one is out swimming down <br/>
the river somewhere.  I will find a cousin and put him back somewhere <br/>
nearby by the fall.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, franzsolo's Ohio Century box is missing.  It was a <br/>
beautiful stamp and I found no trace of it.  I had visited before, so <br/>
I know I was checking the right place.  <br/>
<br/>
There are still 3 boxes which have not yet been found by anyone. 3 <br/>
have only been found by franzsolo.  Most boxes had between 5-10 <br/>
visitors, and I believe pete and wanda have not been by yet. <br/>
<br/>
I replaced the logs of some of the early microboxes with new improved <br/>
logs, so there is now plenty of room for fall visitors. <br/>

  Hiya Fisher<br/>
<br/>
   Part of Team Jedi (Dan, Kelsey and myself) Found 9 of your frogs and 3 other non frogs.  Big park, Lots of Trail.  Spent 6 hours their (Not close to being enough time) <br/>
<br/>
 I found a few bits of Frano Solo's box.  We almost started a Landslid looking for it, Moving rocks, Bugs, Snakes, and those 8 legged Freaks  :O)<br/>
<br/>
  Will have to return when it's cooler<br/>

You must seek the flyfisher's froggies series in the WINTER ! <br/>
Then you have  the fun of  prying  those little froggies  out of the<br/>
frozen earth &amp; snow !!   <br/>
I had a blast last December climbing, slipping &amp; sliding ,digging,and<br/>
hunting his letterboxes !!!<br/>
<br/>
flyfisher carved many cool little froggies !<br/>
<br/>
John Bryan is a Great Park !<br/>
