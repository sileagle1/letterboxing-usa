Some things I might add:<br/>
* Small flashlight - with fresh batteries (lights seem to fade when <br/>
you are searching for boxes.<br/>
* Compass - must have! and learn to use it.<br/>
* Police type whistle (be surprised how well that carries)<br/>
* Gloves (reach not into those crevases barehanded)<br/>
* Walking stick (we have rattlers here)<br/>
* Knife - I carry that on me, guns are so messy<br/>
* Pencil - will write on even soggy books<br/>
* Cell phone - nice for those emergencies<br/>
* Floppy hat - I teach radiation protection, don't get burned<br/>
* Sunscreen - ditto<br/>
* Atkins Bar - or equivalent in case I get hungry<br/>
* Benadryl - spray or pills or both<br/>
<br/>
BTW, do not use baby wipes on the letterbox stamps. A few paper <br/>
towels kept wet in a plastic bag are better and do not leave a scent <br/>
for squirrels to investigate.<br/>

<br/>
We carry a backpack with us with all our stuff. We have a bigger <br/>
tupperware type container with all our stamps, stamp pads (we all use <br/>
a different color), our journals, a pen, a pencil, and a wet paper <br/>
towel in a ziplock bag (to clean the stamps). That's in one <br/>
compartment of the backpack along with some dry paper towels (for <br/>
drying wet boxes), and a few ziplock type bags (to replace any torn <br/>
ones we might find.) Then in another compartment is our homemade <br/>
first aid kit (band-aids and the such), bug spray, suntan lotion <br/>
w/bug repellant in it, handy wipes (for ourselves), a small <br/>
flashlight, and our compass. In yet another compartment (I think it <br/>
has 2 large ones and 1 small) we put our trail snacks for the day. <br/>
Those are for just in case one of us gets hungry and can't wait to <br/>
get back to the car for lunch. :)  The snacks include raisins, trail <br/>
mix, and shelled sunflower seeds. We usually take a bottle of water <br/>
from the cooler before we leave the car and throw that in the <br/>
backpack too, just in case. <br/>
I think that's about it. Usually TrailSnail takes her little Dora the <br/>
Explorer backpack with her pretend binoculars and her bug catcher net <br/>
in it. Half the time it stays in the car though because she doesn't <br/>
want to carry it. LOL<br/>
Oh, and we all have our own walking sticks that we found on our first <br/>
adventure. They stay in the trunk all the time. <br/>

I would add a mini first aid kit (sporting good stores have <br/>
backpacker ones), especially with kids. My man reluctantly <br/>
bought one, rolling his eyes at me like I was crazy and we've, <br/>
ahem, HE's used it twice already. *thank you*  I also suggest <br/>
carrying a small camera, maybe binoculars. We also bring <br/>
lightweight rain gear so we dont have to turn around if it starts to <br/>
rain. But then again we're crazy like that.<br/>

What can I say, we're campers, once you get wet, you dont have <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">OHMYGOSH! I knew I shouldn't read all the messages in this thread. I <br/>
already feel loaded down with too much stuff, and now I see several <br/>
more things I am persuaded to add to my backpack!<br/>
<br/>
Here's what I carry so far:<br/>
<br/>
A walking staff (snake poking stick)<br/>
A wide brimmed hat<br/>
Glasses and sunglasses<br/>
A multipocketed backpack<br/>
<br/>
Inside the backpack, one pocket holds: <br/>
my compass<br/>
some ziplock bags<br/>
<br/>
Another pocket holds:<br/>
several pencils, <br/>
pens, <br/>
colored pencils,<br/>
felt tips<br/>
a pack of embossing markers<br/>
<br/>
Another pocket holds: <br/>
a bottle of water, frozen. (it quickly liquifies in the 100* heat.) <br/>
a few paper towels<br/>
<br/>
Another large section holds:<br/>
my personal stamp<br/>
7 regular sized ink pads<br/>
a few more paper towels<br/>
<br/>
The main section holds:<br/>
all letterboxes waiting to be placed (currently 5, again)<br/>
my personal logbook<br/>
and a spiral notebook<br/>
my camera<br/>
clues for the letterbox(es) we are searching for that day.<br/>
<br/>
And that's what I pack around.<br/>
<br/>
My grandson carries his own backpack, with stamp, stamp pad, log <br/>
book, drink and snack only, I think. Plus he uses a trail stick <br/>
sometimes and also carries binoculars.<br/>
<br/>
The few letterboxes hidden 'nearby' here, don't involve long hikes <br/>
so any snacks we carry will still most likely be left in the cooler <br/>
in the car. That's where we keep them and the extra frozen water <br/>
bottles now. <br/>
<br/>
Also we apply sunscreen and mosquito spray if we need it, before we <br/>
start, so that stays in the car too. <br/>
<br/>
In the car, I keep a small first aid kit, flashlight and a small <br/>
garden fork. I take the garden fork only if I think I might need it <br/>
to easily uncover or cover a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm thinking I might need to add my cell phone, a loud whistle, <br/>
a better first aid kit, anti-venom kit, gloves and Benedryl!  <br/>

&gt;  We also bring <br/>
&gt; &gt; lightweight rain gear so we dont have to turn around if it starts <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; rain. But then again we're crazy like that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You bring rain gear???  We just get wet!  Guess we're the ones that <br/>
&gt; are just crazy like that. LOL<br/>

Gee, it has not really rained since we took up letterboxing. Guess <br/>
