You pulled Molly's Day off BIG time.  Thanks so much for putting it <br/>
together. I had the best time,  kissed by Molly too.  We could not have <br/>
asked for a better day weather wise. The hike in is till one of the <br/>
prettiest around even without frozen waterfall and snowy trails.<br/>
Thanks too , to all the friends that came out to join in the fun . Such <br/>
a great way to spend a whole day .. Lobsta and I stopped at Rock Springs <br/>
Wildlife Preserve in Scotland on the way and were treated to our first <br/>
Quarter as well as the two boxes already there. That was a treat as I <br/>
have wished to hike there for  a long time. Nice hike. the whole way <br/>
even a few challenges as the wooden bridges are sort of "out"  actually <br/>
at 45 degree angles. :-)<br/>
Team Green Dragon gifted me with a most beautiful book.' Creating a <br/>
Butterfly Garden. ' It is a lovely book and  just  full of ideas and <br/>
wonderful pictures. Thank you so much it is a treasure to remember Molly <br/>
Day Gather.  <br/>
Now I have to put some food into this tummy.  Happy butterfly days to <br/>
you all.<br/>
