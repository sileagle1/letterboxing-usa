                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Bonnie<br/>
Personally I enjoy the "X factor" in the quotient. It highlights the<br/>
personable atmosphere this group exemplifies. Plus, I think I have a better<br/>
chance of getting an X than a P F at the rate I'm going. Because of that X I<br/>
haven't "given up the ghost" yet on getting to Mystic! But  I can see though<br/>
why there is some confusion about it. Not knowing that boxes were "Planted"<br/>
rather than "Hidden" I also had to ask. If the X isn't in the quotient you<br/>
see (cuz not everyone uses it) it only begs another question when you do.<br/>
Having been in this group only a few months ...and seen this very question<br/>
several times...I can under your questioning its continued use, you being<br/>
one of the few to answer that chronic question with regularity! How about PF<br/>
with X being added to the FAQ on our web site? Not being a "computer person"<br/>
I ask that naively since I have no idea what is involved to do that...maybe<br/>
the reason its not there now. Robin P0F0X0  :(<br/>

&gt;Some thoughts about the "X" designation:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The "X" makes sense to those who came to the get-together in VT and<br/>
exchanged<br/>
&gt;personal stamp impressions in each other's letterboxing notebooks. That's a<br/>
very<br/>
&gt;small number of letterboxers, however. By and large, it seems to cause a<br/>
lot of<br/>
&gt;confusion, whereas most people immediately understands what "P" and "F"<br/>
stand<br/>
&gt;for.  I am wondering whether we should include the "X" designation on our<br/>
patch.<br/>
&gt;Also wondering why it is "X" and not "E"?  What does everyone think?<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;The X for exchanged, what do you mean, you exchanged<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;to go out and research it as I have not been to this<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;area in about thirteen years.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; the X thing is just a little informal thing we made up after the Fall<br/>
gathering in VT.<br/>
&gt;Maybe suconsciously it was a way to create some momentum in our young<br/>
hobby, or<br/>
&gt;just a way<br/>
&gt;to collect more imprints in our stamp books.  I simply stands for how many<br/>

For counting, you could always go low-tech and pencil the <br/>
count into your log book next to the stamp. The ability to <br/>
register your find on LbNA is meant to allow you to more <br/>
easily skip over clues to letterboxes that you've already <br/>
found rather to a way to electronically keep your count.<br/>

<br/>
- Letterboxes planted in North America by any person, <br/>

and count as Found if Found as below. No other objects can <br/>
be counted as Found.<br/>
<br/>
- Further, a letterbox can only count as Found when the <br/>
letterboxer obtains a stamp image from any stamp <br/>
associated with that box, and their personal stamp image <br/>
has been imprinted (or attempted) in the logbook or other <br/>
part of the box.<br/>
<br/>
- A box can be counted as Found more than once if the <br/>
preceding apply, and its clue, location, and stamp image <br/>
have all changed since Found the first time.<br/>
<br/>
- A box Planted cannot be Found by the person who Planted <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
- Hitchhikers count when initially planted by their <br/>
creator, and count as found when anyone else finds them. <br/>
Hitchhikers are letterboxes like anything else, therefore <br/>
if their creator finds his own creation, he can't count <br/>
it.<br/>

in the beginning, there was a little letterbox.when<br/>

wild, then it became their F-1. when those two<br/>

planted. and only if it had a stamp and logbook.<br/>
now that there are postal letterboxes and cooties and<br/>
fleas and hitchhikers and virtuals and whatever else,<br/>
it is up to the individual as to how they want to keep<br/>
track of their counts for plant and find.<br/>
i have seen some counts as this:<br/>
plant-find-exchange-events-virtuals-cooties-postals-hitchhikers.....<br/>
and all the latters with their own plant and find<br/>
counts.<br/>
so how you play the game is up to you. it is your<br/>
game. you plant the letterbox, you find the<br/>
letterbox.count it how you want.or dont count it.<br/>
thats my take on my game of letterboxing.<br/>

<br/>
Well, we're not *nearly* active enough LBers to be all that useful,<br/>
but maybe it'll help, anyway.  If nothing else, it's pretty easy to<br/>
look in our "handy dandy notebook" ;-) and count our finds:<br/>
<br/>
Six boxes found, seven stamps: one of them is an HH, which we stamped<br/>
on the same page as the box in which we found it.  Two of the boxes<br/>
were in a "series", but each box had its own clues and its own stamp,<br/>
so each find has its own page in our book.  So, you tell me what my<br/>
PFX is; I've no idea, especially as we don't keep any records of DNFs.<br/>
 To be honest, the numbers really don't interest me vis-a-vis LB,<br/>
which will probably amaze everyone, as we are five-year geocachers<br/>
with over a thousand finds and 77 hides.  Go figure, pun intended! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
BTW: DNF means "Did Not Find".  It's common geocaching notation.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I would like to make a page to keep track of PFX. I'm not a computer<br/>
&gt; wiz but willing to learn. Do any of you have a suggestion other than<br/>
&gt; a blah spread sheet.<br/>
<br/>
I'd do the spreadsheet, anyway.  I do that for geodashing, yet<br/>
*another* hunt-in-the-wild game that uses a GPSr, but which has no<br/>
physical box to find.  Its goal is to get within 100 meters of<br/>
randomly-generated points on the globe.  There's a new game each<br/>
month.  I keep track of every dashpoint (DP) which I attempt, as well<br/>
as every one that I reach.  It's really easy to keep track of my<br/>
results, and it makes it a lot easier to dig out older DPs, if a new<br/>
month drops a DP in an area that looks vaguely familar,a nd I might<br/>
need help finding a way to it.  If a spreadsheet really does not<br/>
appeal, then a running total in your logbook, as suggested by others,<br/>
seems the easiest way to do it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If there is a series of 5 boxes and you find all of them, then you have 5 finds.  As far as keeping track, I do it manually in my logbooks.  I have a count of plants, find, exchanges on going through all of my logs.  When I finish a logbook, I number it.  I now have 5 books.<br/>

When you do and X if the person isn't listed how do you post the <br/>
exchange (Bee &amp; Taylor). I know that everyone doesn't use both sites <br/>
LBNA &amp; AQ. So this makes it difficult to keep your actual counts. I <br/>
would like to make a page to keep track of PFX. I'm not a computer wiz <br/>
but willing to learn. Do any of you have a suggestion other than a <br/>
blah spread sheet.<br/>
