Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I was looking for applications to put on my palm pilot the other day <br/>
and I stumbled across a program someone had written to keep track of <br/>
his geocaches.  I thought it would be great to have someting like<br/>
this <br/>
for letterboxing.  Does anyone know if something like this has been <br/>
created yet? If not, I'd like to look into developing one, since I've <br/>
recently taken on a new interest in writing Palm OS programs.    I <br/>
think it would be cool to make it similar to atlasquest, or even <br/>
compatible with it somehow, if it's OK with Ryan.  Let me know your <br/>
thoughts on this.<br/>
