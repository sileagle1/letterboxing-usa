Your idea of a series of boxes around chess is a great idea. I do not of any boxes with that <br/>
theme and I think it would lend it's self well to boxing. But I would find a few more boxes <br/>
before you attempt it. There is a leaning curve that goes with planting. Most boxers first <br/>
plants go missing very quickly. I know mine did.Take some time and learn some of the <br/>
nuances of the game, then plant with abandon.<br/>
