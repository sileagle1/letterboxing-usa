Chip's offer for an event stamp sounds good.  We are also hoping that <br/>
Trish will still make one too.  (After all we do not have to be limited <br/>
to just one event stamp do we?).  We are also hoping some other people <br/>
will bring boxes with them to hide in Burlingame area for this event or <br/>
permanently. <br/>
<br/>
As for food, we think pot luck always works best in this situation.  <br/>
People coming from far away can bring less perishable items like soda <br/>
or dessert or stuff picked up locally while we closer folks can bring <br/>
"hot stuff".<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to meeting some of you "far out folks" as well as the <br/>
local letterboxers.<br/>
