Ok, so basically what it is that you can get paid to open emails <br/>
from legitimate companies and that's it! You sign up by me and you <br/>
get $10 just for doing that. You get to select the categories that <br/>
you want to receive via email. Then, when you get the emails, you <br/>
simply click the URL in the email, wait for a confirmation message <br/>
from Hits4Pay saying that you got credit and that's it! You're done. <br/>
You don't even have to read the darn thing, just open, confirm, and <br/>
close. That gets you 2 cents each. And with between 3 - 10 emails <br/>
daily, depending on your categories, that all adds up. Then, you sign <br/>
up someone else by sending them the URL to your site (details on that <br/>
when you sign up). If they sign up, they are added to your downline <br/>
which in turn will earn you MORE money! Then they do what YOU did and <br/>
you get 1 cent per email they open and they get 2 cents. The more <br/>
people THEY sign up, the more YOU get! It's a win-win situation. Give <br/>
It A Try! It Can't Hurt. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
