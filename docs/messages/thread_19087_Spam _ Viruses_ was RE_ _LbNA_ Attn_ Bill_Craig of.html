                    <div class="plaintext-content">Techie note. There are several viruses around that harvest email addresses,<br/>
and then send out messages, originally from another source, under someone<br/>
else's email ID. What this means in practice is that the viruses most likely<br/>
came from someone/where else. (This is why "reply" messages won't work. That<br/>
address has gone through several layers of bogus sender IDs.) The only<br/>
solution is to work with a reliable virus scanning software. Your ISP may be<br/>
able to ID and filter out these sorts of messages as well. (Mine sends<br/>
suspicious stuff to a separate "spambox" which I can review before deleting<br/>
the messages.) My day job (when I can't go out and play) is web development<br/>
for a government agency. Our email addresses are publically available, so we<br/>
receive numerous messages and responses of this type. <br/>

Sorry for tying up space on the list, but: <br/>
<br/>
I tried email privately with no avail...apparently the messages did <br/>
not go through. Please check you computer as it sends us messages <br/>
daily that are overrun with viruses. <br/>

We see a lot of spam on our incoming mail however yahoo is pretty <br/>
decent at filtering it and not letting you download items until they <br/>
are scanned and deemed "clean".  We've also noticed the spam go <br/>
through the roof as moderators, as anything that gets sent to the <br/>
list-owner email goes to all the moderators.  <br/>

I scanned my computer and found no virus's. My virusware updates <br/>
everytime I log on so it's probably from another source. Thanks for <br/>
the message however.<br/>
