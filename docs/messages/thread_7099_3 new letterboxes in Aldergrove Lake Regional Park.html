<div><span class="311272903-21082002">Date Placed: August 
19, 2002</span></div>
<div><span class="311272903-21082002">Location: Aldergrove 
Lake Regional Park, 8th Avenue &amp; 232nd St. Langley B.C., 
Canada</span></div>
<div><span class="311272903-21082002">Notes: 
</span><span class="311272903-21082002">Keep in 
mind these are micro letterboxes (you're looking for a film canister) so bring a 
pen, ink pad, and smaller stamps.</span></div>

<div><span class="311272903-21082002"><span class="311272903-21082002">Pepin Brook Letterbox</span></span></div>
<div><span class="311272903-21082002"></span> </div>
<div><span class="311272903-21082002">Start at the upper 
parking lot near the park entrance. Head northeast along Pepin Brook 
Trail, through the open meadow and into the forest. Continue past the wood 
fence that follows the ridge. You might occasionally hear cars on a road to 
your left but you'll never see them. Don't miss the wonderful ravine view to 
your right but be careful not to get too close to the edges. Far down below runs 
Peppin Brook, home to the endangered fish, the Sailish Sucker. Continue along 
the path. As the sound of water grows closer, so does what you seek. From the 
wood bridge, go north to the fallen tree in the waterfall. Check the rock at the 
base of the tree. If you have time, complete the 1 hour Pepin Brook loop trail 
for a nice scenic walk through marshes and dykes.</span></div>

Lovers Letterbox</span></div>
<div><span class="311272903-21082002"></span> </div>
<div><span class="311272903-21082002"><span class="311272903-21082002">Start at the upper parking lot near the park 
entrance. Head northeast past the Pepin Brook Trail entrance and into 
the open meadow. This is a great place for stargazing at night as it is far 
away from any city lights. Look for Dale's favorite viewing spot. From 
here, head west into a small trail that descends downwards into the woods. As 
the trail turns left, look for the single birch tree with a triple trunk. Now 
travel 16 paces further to reach the heart of the twins. Check between the two 
lovers. Continuing south and following the road will eventually take you to 
Aldergrove Lake and the start of the next letterbox.</span></span></div>

<div><span class="311272903-21082002"><span class="311272903-21082002">Just like a frightened rabbit, this trail darts every 
direction. From one of the park information signs, find Aldergrove Lake. 
Aldergrove Lake is a stream fed man-made lake that's great for cooling 
off in the summer. Once you reach the lake, look for the drinking 
fountain. Head 160 degrees magnetic to the far set of picnic 
tables. Now follow the trail that goes southeast into the woods. Watch for 
rabbits as they're very popular around here. At the fork, turn left and walk 18 
paces. There should now be a gate to your right. Enter through the gate and turn 
right to be facing southwest. Watch for horses as this is an equestrian trail! 
Now walk southwest 53 paces to stand between four large trees. Check down 
low inside the tree with the crook!</span></span></div>
