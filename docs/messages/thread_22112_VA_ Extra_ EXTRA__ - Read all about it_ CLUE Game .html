                    <div class="plaintext-content">"Hey there Nick Danger, Mr. 'Thinks He's a Private Detective', <br/>
what's your hurry, where's the fire?"<br/>
"You're not going to believe this."<br/>
"Why, someone talk you into running the Clue Exchange Game again?"<br/>
"Nah, Mr. Boddy's been found dead downtown."<br/>
"Again!?"<br/>
"Again. Another cousin heir. I gotta get down there. See ya later."<br/>
Friday, 10:13PM. <br/>
<br/>
I arrived at the Town Square and walked into the large convention <br/>
tent where Mr. Boddy was found dead an hour earlier. I knew there <br/>
was some kind of merchandising convention in town but I was <br/>
unprepared for what I saw. On one side Mr. Clean consoled the <br/>
sobbing Morton Salt Girl. Tears poured down her face. On the other <br/>
side the Pillsbury Dough Boy was in a heated conversation with the <br/>
Land-O-Lakes indian maiden. In the middle, Inspector Grogue was <br/>
just  finishing interrogating Cracker Jack. <br/>
<br/>
"What's the story Inspector? I'd say you've got some circus on your <br/>
hands here but it looks more like the corner grocery."<br/>
<br/>
"Very funny Nick. Always with the clever remark. Take this seriously <br/>
for a change will you. <br/>
Our pre-eminent citizen, Mr. Boddy, was found dead here about an <br/>
hour ago. The body's obviously been moved so the murder could have <br/>
happened anywhere between the Woolworth's five and dime and the <br/>
KrispyKreme donut shop. How can I ever sort this out?!"<br/>
<br/>
"Looks to me like ya have as many possible Suspects, Weapons, and <br/>
Places as the labels on A&amp;P's shelves." <br/>
<br/>
"Well Nick, you think it's funny now but Mrs. Boddy has asked for <br/>
you by name to help the department investigate. Now who's laughing?"<br/>
<br/>
Moxie man then interrupted us. While he complained to the Inspector <br/>
about losing shelf life or something I realized I didn't have a clue <br/>
where to begin.<br/>
<br/>

P.S. <br/>
<br/>
GET A CLUE! Or rather bring a Clue. Here's the scoop. Any guy or <br/>
doll can play Clue at the VA Mystery Gather this Fall, see? You just <br/>
have to sign up for an image and bring a stamp or two. <br/>
<br/>
THE THEME: Those familiar Product Logos we all know and love. <br/>
<br/>
Did Mr. Clean do it in the KrispyKreme with the Brillo Pad? <br/>
<br/>
Send Nick Danger your clue of choice and we'll try to keep from <br/>
having duplicates. Sorry, The Keebler Elf and Treehouse are already <br/>
suspects. Watch this space for information on a database we will <br/>
post of what Suspects, Weapons, and Places have been taken. <br/>
<br/>
It's never too early to start carving. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and just in case you were worried, I hear the management has <br/>
some new game mechanics to prevent the little snafus we had last <br/>
time. Got me? <br/>
<br/>
In any case everyone should leave with some interesting impressions. <br/>
