Diego.<br/>
<br/>
Ski Beach Box:  My warm up.  Found this microbox the first day I <br/>
arrived.<br/>
<br/>
Old Town Box:  I quick stop on my second night before dinner.<br/>
<br/>
La Jolla Box:  Finished work early the last day I was there &amp; headed up <br/>
the coast.  Found this box just sitting out on top of the bushes.  I <br/>
did my best to hide it under the bushes where it belongs.  Great views <br/>
from this spot of the coast.  Saw about 20 sea lions basking in the sun.<br/>
<br/>
Tea Time Box:  Continued up the coast to UCSD to find the Tea Time <br/>
box.  Great walk with more wonderful views of the coast line.<br/>
<br/>
San Diego Sails Box:  I think I enjoyed this box the most because of <br/>
the great trail &amp; awesome views.  I parked on the street &amp; didn't pay <br/>
the $5.00 to park in the preserve to I had to walk to the trail head.  <br/>
What a walk straight up the hill to the trail head!  No hills like this <br/>
in Rhode Island!  I thoroughly enjoyed the trail and the Torrey Pines <br/>
preserve.<br/>
<br/>
Gliderport:  I looked briefly for this box but could not find it.  <br/>
There were a lot of people around and the bushes were overgrown making <br/>
it difficult to search too carefully.  I will look again for this box <br/>
on my next trip to San Diego.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the box planters.<br/>
