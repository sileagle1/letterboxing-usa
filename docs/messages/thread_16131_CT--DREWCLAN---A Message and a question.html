                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went out to the "GIANT'S LAUREL" box today and stamped in. Now the log book <br/>
is FULL.  THERE IS NO ROOM LEFT in the logbook. I would have put a new one <br/>
in, but i can never remember to bring things like that.  2)QUESTION--Has the <br/>
second box been replaced? The clues said that it had gone missing again so i <br/>
didn't bother to hike out to it. I'm not sure how up-to-date this is, so i was <br/>
just wondering. Hope to see everyone out at the gathering this weekend ! <br/>
--THANKS--<br/>
