<br/>
     Sue and I spent the weekend in VT and were joined on Saturday <br/>
for a wonderful day of boxing with TeamGreenDragon. We were able to <br/>
find Legerdemaine's Toad Mystery Box, Rubaduc's Vermont Loon and 11 <br/>
of the Valley Quest boxes.<br/>
<br/>
     We also got to witness an auspicious event - but we will leave <br/>
that news to Brian and Lori! [TeamGreenDragon - thanks for a <br/>
wonderful day with great friends! Can't wait to do it again.]<br/>

the fireworks on Friday nite and had a delicious breakfast<br/>
prepared by Mark at their lovely VT home on Saturday and<br/>
headed out for a wild day of wandering around some quaint<br/>
New England towns doing Valley Quests. We were having so much<br/>
fun that we forgot to eat! <br/>
<br/>
We are thinking of heading back up this weekend to do some<br/>
more letterboxing including the Prayer Rock (Vermont Viking's box)<br/>
So - Wanda &amp; Pete - maybe we'll catch you up there after all!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Pepe's for such a fun day!!!!!<br/>

Also, Curious Crane and Latte Man - we stamped into Vermont Tree<br/>
on the fourth also, we kept hoping we would bump into you.<br/>

<br/>
Spent a great day Saturday in VT with TeamGreenDragon, finding a few <br/>
mystery letterboxes and paying homage to Prayer Rock. We were <br/>
surprised how few people have logged into this wonderful piece of <br/>
letterboxing history. Prayer Rock is at the very least the first hand <br/>
carved letterbox in the country if not the very first overall. We <br/>
encourage all New Englanders to make that trip to Bristol, VT.<br/>
<br/>
Received an email from the new owner of the house where our Mystery <br/>
Inventor box is located. It is out of commission for now, but he has <br/>
the box and has given me permission to rehide it on the property. <br/>
I'll keep you all informed when it's back.<br/>
<br/>
Hope your 4th weekend was the best,<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
<br/>
