                    <div class="plaintext-content">Come to think of it I was involved in a<br/>
Geocache Patch Quilt for a charity.<br/>
Different areas in the US requested a number of quilt squares and placed<br/>
them in a Geocache,<br/>
As Geocachers found the box you would stamp your signature stamp onto a<br/>
cloth square. <br/>
My stamp image came out nice. <br/>
After all the patches were collected a group sewed the quilt.<br/>
Just my thought on how the stamp came out good.So I guess you could<br/>
stamp a T shirt or your forehead ,etc.<br/>

Forehead is a good place, but I was thinking of being a little more <br/>
