Planted By: Irishtinker, Butterfly and Leader of the Pack in honor of Molly<br/>
a great dog!<br/>
<br/>
The first box in this series is Town Crier, planted in honor of the birthday<br/>
of Butterfly and enjoyed by many at a gather there. Well that was when<br/>
Butterfly lost her keys and Molly came through finding them in 2 feet of<br/>
snow in the bitter cold after we had looked for three days. Her new status<br/>
as local hero dog, and our boredom with the long cold winter, a new plan was<br/>
hatched. Yes , we should have several Molly boxes to plant ,that would be<br/>
fun! The ice and snow came, the sub zero temperatures came, the thaw and<br/>
heavy rain came. We carved and waited and waited and waited. Finally on a<br/>
day that felt oh so balmy and was really only 30 degrees Butterfly and<br/>
Leader of the Pack began to plant the series. They went to Town Crier box at<br/>
Diana's Pool in Chaplin , Ct. You need those clues to begin your quest. We<br/>
checked in at the box to see who had visited recently and replaced the box<br/>
carefully( be sure not to disturb historic stone walls) . On to plant the<br/>
series!<br/>
Just below the box there is a gap in the wall and we passed through on an<br/>
upstream adventure. We walked along this level keeping the river to the left<br/>
and the cleared land to the right. After awhile we we came to where a small<br/>
stream joins the mighty river. Here we stayed on the right side of the<br/>
stream and and counted 16 paces ( left foot count) to the rocky outcrop.<br/>
Down under snuggled in is the " Molly Key To My Heart" box. After stamping<br/>
and carefully hiding the box again we continued on the right side of the<br/>
stream, cleared land still on your right. A few minutes later you come to an<br/>
obvious spot to cross the little stream.Two trees lean over the stream their<br/>
roots all twisted over rocks. Look low to find the " Key to Molly's Success"<br/>
box. Here you can sit on the rocks to stamp -hide it well when you are<br/>
finished. Careful don't get your feet wet! Now on the other side,you will<br/>
see ahead the largest of the Hemlocks in this woods. Turn your back on it<br/>
and proceed down the stream keeping the river on your right and the stream<br/>
on your left. Over the years the fisherman that test their skills in these<br/>
waters have kept the banks of the river clear and it makes for nice walking.<br/>
Walk down stream until you come to a watery rosspath. Here you have the<br/>
river on your right and the stream on your left and only a tree and stone to<br/>
help you across. BUT wait .....Is that Molly barking? Maybe she has found<br/>
something! Turn about face and take thirteen paces upstream. Look to the<br/>
left for a tree next to a boulder. About four feet up the tree is a hollow<br/>
and you will find the " Molly Our Hero Box" stuffed up inside the cavity.<br/>
Have fun getting the stamp just don't fall in the river or drop the box in!<br/>
Please replace the box up in the tree and wedge the rock and bark in to hide<br/>
it. We thank Molly for being such a faithful letterboxing companion. Good<br/>
Dog Molly, Pat -Pat- Pat! <br/>
Come back down the river to where you parked your car. <br/>
