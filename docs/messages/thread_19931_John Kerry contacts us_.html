<br/>
It looks like Funhog is not the only letterboxer to have contact with <br/>
Sen. John Kerry . . . <br/>
<br/>
Today, I received an email from the Senator. Apparently, he has been <br/>
following our webpage's story of his meeting with the Hog and his <br/>
moving the Rosie Ruiz HH along on its way.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, John Kerry has sent and given us permission to display <br/>
his personal signature stamp - which is now posted on our website.<br/>
<br/>
Sen. Kerry - if you are reading this - please keep up the <br/>
communication. In fact, I would love to interview you so that all <br/>
letterboxers can see exactly where your heart rests and where you <br/>
really stand on letterboxing issues.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
<br/>

You owe me one new keyboard because mine is toast from the drink I <br/>
just spit all over it from reading your interview.  (I had to type <br/>
this from another computer!).  <br/>
<br/>
Brilliant!<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
