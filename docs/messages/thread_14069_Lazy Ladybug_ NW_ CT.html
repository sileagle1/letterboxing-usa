                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi All,<br/>
I went to check on "Lazy Ladybug" to see if any more animals have been <br/>
bothering her. What I found was more heart wrenching than what the animals did - <br/>
Humans have not done ANYTHING around the Park except to put 2 concrete barricades <br/>
at the gate and even took down the Park's Shield. I am so sad to see this <br/>
park neglected along with others like Dennis Hill &amp; Haystack Mt. So, "Lazy <br/>
Ladybug" will be finding a new resting place and I will keep everyone posted.<br/>
