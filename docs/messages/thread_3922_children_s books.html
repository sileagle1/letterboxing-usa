&gt; As our yougster opens the box, finding other notes and trinkets <br/>
&gt; hidden 30 years before, the father steps out from behind a boulder <br/>
&gt; with a headress on, welcoming his son into the club he began when he <br/>
&gt; was himself just a boy growing up in the house with his parents.<br/>
&gt; <snip><br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyone have any idea what book I <br/>
&gt; might be talking about??&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know this one!  Read it to my son a year or so ago.  I'll poke around<br/>
in the bookshelves and see if I can find the title for you.<br/>

Whew -- we have a LOT of bookshelves!  The book you were talking about is<br/>
called _The Secret Hide-out_, story and pictures by John Peterson.  The<br/>
version I have is from 1963, Scholastic books.  Like you, we're a frugal<br/>
family, so I have an enormous collection of hand-me-down books, even more<br/>
so because we homeschool.  My kids love to read the Golden Books that<br/>
belonged that belonged to their grandparents, and all the other fun<br/>
stories people pass along to us when they're cleaning out their old<br/>
books, PLUS about 40 books from the library every couple of weeks!<br/>
<br/>
We're in CT, so are unlikely to search for your boxes in OH anytime soon,<br/>
but I'm enjoying your creativity as you come up with clues.<br/>
<br/>
Peace -- debbie, p5 f30-something<br/>

Thanks for finding the title. It is a story which involves finding <br/>
written clues in a secret hiding place that lead to another secret <br/>
hiding place. (But they did not have rubber stamps.) That may have <br/>
given me a memory trigger when I started the geocaching/letterboxing <br/>
activity.<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that the whole book is out on the web with pictures if <br/>
you care to take a look...  (The joys of books going out of print!)<br/>
