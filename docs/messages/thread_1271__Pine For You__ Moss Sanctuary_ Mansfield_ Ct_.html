<div>In the Storrs section of Mansfield on rte 195 
turn onto rte 275 at the Mansfield Town Hall. Immediatley turn into the driveway 
of the Graduate apartments opposite the town hall. Follow to the center rear of 
the complex. The Moss Sanctuary sign is somewhat obscurred by leaves.  
Note: there is a timbering operation due to begin soon due to disease in the 
pines, trees are marked for removal, the box is beyond the  logging area. 
</div>
<div>     In the trail to soft 
cool woodland walk this trail is rated EASY, the time  will be under 1 
HOUR, the sponsor is Cock-A-Doodle-Moo 4-H club. You walk to the first  
fork in the road and bear left to continue. </div>
<div>     Walk to the pond it is 
so easy, this is a favorite walk for high school and college students all on 
campus nearby. </div>
<div>      At the pond take 
a moment to enjoy the beautiful  view, you could be in Maine. </div>
<div>     Next you want to follow 
the trail as it goes left around the pond you begin. </div>
<div>Water flows over a spillway trickling down the 
stream cross onto the dam.  Step carefully over the spillway . 
</div>
<div>      Be sure no one is 
around you, wait if there are others nearby,  letterboxing is about the 
secret of the woods.  After the spillway  take a few steps , when you 
are able to drop over the edge of the stonework near the stream. Face where you 
came from. What you seek is in  a wooden den.   Good luck. 
</div>
<div>     To complete your walk 
follow the trail as it goes around the very edge of the</div>
<div>of the pond and joins up  about where you 
first viewed the pond.  </div>
<div>   Have fun , keep the secret.
