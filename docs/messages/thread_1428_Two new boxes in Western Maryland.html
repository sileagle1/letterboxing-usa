Begin your trip at Sidling Hill on Interstate-68 near Hancock, Maryland. They <br/>
have a very nice information center that explains a lot of the rock <br/>
formations and terms that you will encounter in this series. <br/>
<br/>
There are 2 rock types exposed at this site, the Oriskany Sandstone and the <br/>
Heilderberg limestone. These sands are used for making glass. The Heilderberg <br/>
group is the lower most strata of the Devonian system in this area. Both <br/>
groups are fooiliferous.<br/>
<br/>
When you have seen and read everything proceed west on I-68 and exit at the <br/>
first available exit. Turn left over bridge and re-enter I-68 East. Exit at <br/>
Woodmont Road, bear right and then make a left on Route 144. Drive a short <br/>
distance and trun left onto Sandy Mile Road. Quarry is about 1 mile down on <br/>
the right just before a bridge.<br/>
<br/>
Park your car along the side of the road and take the trail past the Oriskany <br/>
 Sandstone. Follow the trail a little way down a slight incline back into the <br/>
woods. It opens to a large clearing where a limestone quarry is. Look around <br/>
at the base of that quarry and in those stones for fossils.  I found a few <br/>
small ones. When you have finished collecting go back the way you came and <br/>
look for a tire to the left of the trail. You should find another fossil in <br/>
there. When you get back to your car and the road go to the left a little bit <br/>
and look in the sandstone there and you should find some large shell fossils <br/>
in there.  Good hunting.<br/>
<br/>
