                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey there fellow boxers,<br/>
<br/>
There will be a Letterboxing Camping Gathering the weekend of July 9-11 in the Bucks County, PA area. The main goal is to get together with other obxers, either for the weekend or just for the day on Saturday and exhange images, trail stories and hunt some of numerous boxes within a few foot walk to an hours drive of Washington Crossing PA. The second reason is so that those folks who have ordered T-Shirts can pick them up from me and save themselves the freight charge (if the T-Shirt Thing works out - we are at 40 and counting so far). We will be camping at Colonial Woods Campground in upper Black Eddy, ph# 610-847-5808 or www.colonialwoods.com . They have 13 tent sites near each other open that weekend and 4 others a little further away from the rest. The sites are $28 a night per family. What is a family, you ask? Two adults and up the 3 kids. It's $6 for each addtional person. You can have up to 2 tents on the site, one large for the adults, one smaller for the kids. Dogs are<br/>
 welcome on leash and must be cleaned up after. Sorry ADG, no lemurs allowed. Call Sue at 610-847-5808 to make a reservation if you are interested, she has been really helpful and got us the large pavillion at the campground for our Friday night Howdy Party. One nights deposit is required and can be cancelled within 14 days of the 9th for a $5 fee. I would love to reserve the sites the way Celtic Pride did in MD recently but I honestly can't afford it. They were very gracious to do that for us. IYou can use Creict Card or check. Also, didn't see any rules against alcohol. I am sure if we don't get too rowdy we'll be fine.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the my tentative schedule for the weekend:<br/>
<br/>
Friday night - 8 - 11PM Howdy Party under the large pavillion. distribute T-shirts, image exchange, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday - 9 - 3 Daytime Gathering for Non-Campers at Sullivan Pavillion in Washington Crossing, PA. <br/>
I will be there the whole time to distribute shirts to anyone not camping out with us. There are several boxes within easy walking distance of the Pavillion and numerous others with an hour's drive radius. A beautiful, bountiful area.<br/>
<br/>
6:00 - 8 PM Group Pot Luck Dinner at my site for whomever wants to attend. <br/>
<br/>
8 - ?? Campfire, games and fun. Whatever you prefer there will be something for everyone. (Scarab, SewBizzy and Celtic Pride are not allowed to be on the same team this time.)<br/>
<br/>
Sunday AM 8 - 10?? Group breakfast if you would like to participate.<br/>
<br/>
Noon - Checkout and Goodbye. don't forget to grab some boxes on your way home!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, local planters, this is a great opportunity to plant some new boxes before our "guests" arrive. <br/>
<br/>
So please check your schedule and let me know ASAP if you are interesting in either Camping or the Saturday Gathering. Also you'll need to make your reservation as soon as you can. It doesn't matter whether or not you ordered T-Shirts, just come and hang out with us. We should have a blast. Hope to see you there<br/>
<br/>
A HUGE thank you to SewBizzy for all of her help with this so far and all of the help she will be providing on the weekend (hee, hee!). I am hoping to get a couple more volunteers for various details.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE reply offline. I am already posting to several lists and I know this will irritate some people, sorry! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  now that sounds fun-- a campout within an hour of us.  I haven't been to the particular campground, but I can tell you all it's pretty over there &amp; is right near the Delaware R.  Thanks for planning this, Hikers... now I just have to see if I can talk my family into it-- they still think mom is a little nuts (could take awhile to cure that) but are more intrigued with letterboxing than they might admit at school!  We've yet to meet a real live letterboxer, too-- other than those we've told about it.  --lunaryakketyact  <br/>
