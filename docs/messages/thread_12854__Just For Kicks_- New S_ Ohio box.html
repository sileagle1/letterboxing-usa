Just For Kicks<br/>
<br/>
To find this microbox (please bring a stamp pad and pencil!) go to <br/>
the rest stop on US Route #35 about 7 or 8 miles west of Jackson.  To <br/>
the right (East?) of the rest rooms you will find three small <br/>
freeform sculptures and beyond these a cute little red roofed <br/>
dispenser for pet waste bags in front of a small bridge.  Cross the <br/>
bridge and make your way to the nearby shelter house.  Stand at the <br/>
south corner of the shelter house and take a bearing of 150.  Walk <br/>
about 14 paces.  (2 steps = 1 pace)  You should find yourself at a <br/>
small table adjacent to a barbecue grill.  Go 20 paces due south from <br/>
this table.  To your right (West) should be the last pair in a line <br/>
of tall cedar-type landscaping trees.  You should find "Just For <br/>
Kicks" at the base of the southern-most tree under some very prickly <br/>
needles.  Please be discrete as this is a fairly busy park and there <br/>
are usually attendants on duty.  When you find it, please email us at <br/>
bigguy_45640@yahoo.com and let us know if it needs any attention.  <br/>
Have fun!<br/>
