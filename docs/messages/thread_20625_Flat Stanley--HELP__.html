to the Capital of California today for a lovely outing! After lunch (ham <br/>
roll-ups which Stanley preferred UN rolled)  and stamping in, we realized there <br/>
was no list of letterboxers in the package to send him on to!<br/>
<br/>
HELP! Where should I send this little guy? (We've kept this little 'problem' <br/>
a secret from Stanley so we don't unduly trouble him. We've just told him we <br/>
enjoy his company so much, we'd like him to stay on a day or two longer.)<br/>
