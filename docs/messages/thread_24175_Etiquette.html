However, if you plant a box in such a location, make sure the clue <br/>
clearly states there is a fee involved.  Also, AQ has a icon for this.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Personally, I would make sure to put a note in the clues if there was a fee,<br/>
so folks can choose whether or not they want to pay the fee before driving<br/>
to the place and getting surprised.  There are two boxes in a park in Lake<br/>
County, IL and altho it's a public park, they charge a fee to non-Lake<br/>
County residents.  I don't know if the clues reflect that or not, but they<br/>
didn't reflect that when I went looking for the boxes way back when, and it<br/>
just would've been nicer if I'd known that ahead of time.  I emailed the<br/>
placer with the suggestion but got no reply back.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that, sometimes, if an entrance fee is attached to a place, it<br/>
also might be a place that is stricter about enforcing rules against things<br/>
like letterboxes, since it's considered public but private property.  If a<br/>
placer doesn't have permission to place a box, some places have been known<br/>
to consider it "trespassing" to place a box on their grounds, and will<br/>
sometimes threaten prosecution.  So, if the placer doesn't have permission,<br/>
the searchers need to be sneakysneakysneaky.  I think zoos, which tend to<br/>
attract families and have a more casual feel to the place, might be better<br/>
about such things than formal gardens might be.  And places like museums<br/>
often tend to be anxious about such things because of 9/11 fallout.<br/>

Hi, All,<br/>
     Someone asked me if there are "rules" about placing (or not placing)<br/>
letterboxes in public areas where one has to pay a fee to enter - for<br/>
example a zoo, or a big garden...that sort of thing. After some thought, I<br/>
had to admit I was stymied. Anyone want to help me out?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've gone and found leterboxes at places where there was a fee to<br/>
enter. The clues just clearly stated the hours open, and told the<br/>
amount of admission, so you know up front. I also think it depends on<br/>
amount -- $3-5 is not a big deal for me, but a family with 3 kids<br/>
might need to budget for the outing. So try to pick places not too<br/>
expensive. :-) I also saw a Boars Head series this past Dec and you<br/>
could only get the last one in the set by attending the Boars Head,<br/>
which involved buying a ticket to the show, IIRC. I still would have<br/>
gone to get it, if my own Boars Head had not conflicted with it.<br/>
<br/>
There is a box near me I would like to get, but it is a Kiddlieland,<br/>
an amusement park with a $20 admission price. And I can't go on most<br/>
of the rides. So I won't be getting that one any time soon.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a problem supporting place slike zoos and museums and<br/>
such with my admission fee, and I enjoy being sent on treks to these<br/>
places and having an excuse to go see them. If people can't swing the<br/>
admission price, then thye will have to skip that box.<br/>
