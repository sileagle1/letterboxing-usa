<p>Hello 
All, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We just 
returned from a great weekend of camping, hiking, and of course 
letterboxing!  After finding a great hike yesterday we planted our first 
box this morning.  The clues are below.  Please let us know if you try 
it and have any feedback.  We'd love to hear from you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Best 
Regards, </p>

Family</p>

<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Rated: Moderate</p>
<p>This box is on Eagle Ledge Trail 
in October Mountain State Forest, in the Berkshires of Western 
Massachusetts.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>To get to the trail, youll need 
to get to the Lee campground within October Mountain State Forest: First, take 
the Mass Pike to the Lee exit (exit 2).<span>  
</span>Turn right onto Route 20  West to Center Street in Lee.<span>  </span>From here follow the brown signs to the 
State Park.<span>  </span>Right after going 
through the campground entrance there is a kiosk on the left that contains trail 
maps (we recommend picking one up, especially if youd like to hike beyond the 
box) and directs you to parking nearby the kiosk.<span>  </span>Park either down here, or park closer to 
the trailhead.<span>  </span>From here go up the 
hill to the upper campground area, you will pass the comfort station on your 
right.<span>  </span>Keep going straight, you 
will pass a dumpster on your right.<span>  
</span>At the top of the paved road is the trailhead.<span>  </span>There is a no camping allowed area up 
here with a picnic table that would be a nice place to have lunch; you could 
also park up here to get your start on the trail.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>To the right side of the paved 
road is the trail entrance.<span>  </span>It is 
not marked with a name, but it is very obvious and has a sign showing that 
motorized vehicles are prohibited (they are allowed on other trails within this 
Forest  so please keep an eye out if you choose to explore more trails).<span>   </span>Follow the blue blazed trail up a 
gentle hill.<span>  </span>At the fork, go left 
to Tamarack Trail.<span>  </span>Morgan likes to 
plunk, plunk across the streambed here.<span>  
</span>Continue on until you reach a T; go right at the T onto Eagle Ledge 
Trail.<span>  </span>Your blazes will now be 
yellow.<span>  </span>Morgan adds that if you 
have any members of your boxing party that are of the canine persuasion they 
will have a hard time concentrating on directions with all of the chipmunks to 
see and hear in this area!<span>  </span>After a 
nice while of hiking through this beautiful terrain you will see a big rusty 
colored boulder to the right of the trail.<span>  
</span>About 30 paces from this big boulder you will see two downed trees 
staring at you.<span>  </span>They and their 
friends are piled up like Lincoln Logs on the left side of the trail.<span>  </span>Just beyond these trees is a stone 
wall.<span>  </span>Proceed through the stone 
wall to the first big boulder on the left of the trail.<span>  </span>Take a compass reading at this boulder: 
243.<span>  </span>Follow this reading to the 
place in the wall where the eagle hides.<span>  
</span>Stamp in and re-hide the box.<span>  
</span>You may return the way you came or continue on for a great hike.<span>  </span>If you choose to continue on, you will 
be rewarded with some decent technical terrain including some vertical.<span>  </span>If you dont have Morgan or another 
large canine with you to pull you up the hilly terrain, you will get a great 
workout!<span>  </span>Again, we recommend a 
trail map if you choose to continue to explore, as this trail does not loop.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p><span>Have 
a great time!</span></div></body></html>
