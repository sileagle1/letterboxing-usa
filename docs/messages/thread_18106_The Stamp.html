<br/>
Every boxers stamp is personal.  We started out with stamps we bought in<br/>
a craft store and this year will move on to making our own.  The great<br/>
thing about letterboxing and geocaching both is that it's personal. It's<br/>
your creativity.  The most fun I have in doing this, other than seeing<br/>
the great places I would have never found otherwise, is seeing all the<br/>
wonderful stamps people take the time to create.  It's so great that so<br/>
many people enjoy this.  In my own opinion, I really like the fact that<br/>
it's NOT publicized a lot.  I would worry about the boxes and the fun<br/>
falling into the wrong hands.  My own two cents.  Enjoy!!!!!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, the stamps can be anything, especially if they are <br/>
representative of you or something meaningful to you.  I have seen <br/>
plain bears, birds, etc with no words all the way up to elaborate <br/>
family portrait ones complete with names and the family dog.  You <br/>
can write in your name or any add'l info in the log book, <br/>
like "winter fairy was here" or whatever.  Mine is a plain <br/>
armadillo, no words, not very impressive.  But I wanted to get <br/>
started and if I waited til I made the perfect stamp I might waiting <br/>
forever!  I'll just keep working on making better ones for when I <br/>
place my own boxes. <br/>
<br/>
I would recommend making something or even buying something simple, <br/>
and heading right on out to find a letterbox.  Then you can look <br/>
through what other people have had...I think it'll give you <br/>
confidence when you see some are simple, some are just purchased pre-<br/>
made ones, and some are really cool handmade ones.  Anything goes!  <br/>
We went out the first time with a couple of tiny Pokemon stamps from <br/>
my sons' art kit.  We then made our own simple stamp and went back <br/>
to those same boxes and stamped our new stamp in them :)<br/>
<br/>
have fun,<br/>

I was trying to make this beautifull, meaningful stamp that <br/>
represented the spiritual side of me, but was having a hard time <br/>
coming up with a concept.  One night my wife made a comment about <br/>
my "monkey toes" and that's when the light bulb went on. I've used <br/>
monkeytoes as my internet and letterboxing name ever since. <br/>
Letterboxing is fun and loose, I was trying too hard.  <br/>
