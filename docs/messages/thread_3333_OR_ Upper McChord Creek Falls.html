<br/>
We actually got a moment free from our busy schedules to do a beautiful,<br/>
short hike in the Columbia River Gorge this weekend.  I don't think I've<br/>
ever seen the Columbia so low.  It was great to get out into nature and<br/>
breathe the air after this past week of tragedy.  I am thankful that<br/>
life is able to go on for some of us, though I feel such sorrow and<br/>
grief for those who suffer closely and personally from the heinous<br/>
attacks.<br/>
<br/>
We found one of Ryan's Safari series.  This stamp is so adorable!  And<br/>
the place where it is hidden is fantastic.  Funhog was the first to<br/>
stamp in so we're in good company.  It's nice that we can be one with<br/>
nature and God through this hobby.  I really needed something like this<br/>
this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
