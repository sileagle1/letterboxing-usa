                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just read the article in the paper. That was really a good write up. Nice to put a face or at least a body to some of the names. I got to the article by going to<br/>
http://www.ctnow.com and then doing a search for letterboxing on the ctnow site. The full address wouldn't take me there.<br/>
  By the way I usually don't add a ink pad to my boxes. Do the rest of you? I just assumed you would bring one along with your stamp and personal log book. I hope it isn't causing a problem? Let me know what is the norm and the best way. <br/>
  Also it is ok to download the description of letterboxing and print up a bunch of them to leave at a outdoor equipment store or other places. What about printing it in a newsletter? <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

standard is not to include an inkpad.  The asumption is that the 
letterboxer brings his/her own (maybe several for multi-colored effects).  
Many CT letterboxers have been generous by placing inkpads in their boxes, 
but I think we shouldn't expect that to be the case in all boxes.  In 
addition to the incremental cost to the box, there's the issue of how long the 
pad will stay good in outdoor conditions.  How well do they freeze.
