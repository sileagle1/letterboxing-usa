                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, I found my first ever mystery box. Sadly the logbook and everythign but the stamp was <br/>
ruined. by wet. The stamp was very cool -- my favorite B52's song! Then I went looking for <br/>
another. I looked and looked -- no luck. :-( Same thing happened Friday -- found one <br/>
mystery box, very cool stamp but the inside completely soaked -- went looking and looking <br/>
for a set of 2 others, no luck.<br/>
<br/>
It was fun. Beautiful days to be outside. <br/>
