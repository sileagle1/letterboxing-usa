	 We are packing up and bringing "The Budster" with us to the Cape<br/>
Henlopen State Park area in Delaware in a few weeks to explore.  We will<br/>
bring our "Ride and Stride" to pull Bud to the various places with our<br/>
bikes to hunt down LB's weather permitting.<br/>
	This old laptop is going along for the ride too. Got a wireless card for<br/>
it so maybe there will be  some wireless service along the way so that<br/>
the LB site can be readily available.  Even if it can't hookup it will be<br/>
useful to jot down  notes about our searches.<br/>
	So along with my LB kit we will have other fun things too. Kites , high<br/>
power glasses , star charts ,treasure &amp; locator detectors and lots of<br/>
snacks.  Ol'Roys for Bud. <br/>
	On or way down  around Cape May we will need to find some place that<br/>
allows dogs for a stay over point before <br/>
we continue the next day over to the ferryrude to  Delaware. <br/>
<br/>
	Hope to find some good riding trails for our bikes and maybe there will<br/>
be letterboxes along the way!  <br/>
<br/>
	We need more biking letterboxes!  <br/>
