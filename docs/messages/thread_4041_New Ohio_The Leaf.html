Short (20-30 min) :easy<br/>
<br/>
	I finished my last day of work before the Christmas holidays. It was<br/>
early so I drove to the covered bridge to take a short hike before going<br/>
home. The sign on the bridge said built in 1983. It looked more like 1883<br/>
except for the traffic signals on the bridge. After parking I walked the<br/>
bridle path running with the river. A blue heron was wading along the<br/>
bank. It was surprising to see the heron still here almost at Christmas,<br/>
but it had been warm up until a week ago. Two pairs of mallards paddled<br/>
silently farther down river. The path took me closer to the great blue. I<br/>
left the path briefly to see how close I could get. She seemed oblivious,<br/>
but at 50' finally squawked a brief protest, flapped into the air and<br/>
glided down river. <br/>
	I turned back to the path and walked about a minute. I was startled by<br/>
the very last leaf of the season falling down from above. All the trees<br/>
were bare. The leaf was peculiar, glinting green and then silver in the<br/>
clear winter sun. Swirling around in a strange slow pattern, it circled a<br/>
tree and drifted toward a swale. It finally nestled under a hollow half<br/>
piece of sawn log, next to a hollow stump. <br/>
	I walked the dozen steps down &amp; off the trail to find this last lonely<br/>
leaf. I looked carefully under the log to see only bark and sticks. Since<br/>
I didn't see any snakes or skunks, I reached in to find a small white<br/>
box. Inside was a tiny image of the leaf. I returned the leaf and box to<br/>
its cozy hiding place, taking only the image of the leaf and the<br/>
beautiful winter day. Sometimes the cruel world impresses into our<br/>
memory. The past year was full of searing images. This was a moment of<br/>
quiet to wonder again at the miracle of life, the beauty of God's world.<br/>
It was a little bit of healing. I invite you to search out the leaf. It<br/>
is not a spectacular image. It is just there for you to take a moment and<br/>
remember the good things.<br/>
PS happy birthday Dan. - <br/>
