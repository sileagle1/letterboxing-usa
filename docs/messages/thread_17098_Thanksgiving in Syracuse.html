                    <div class="plaintext-content">I took my wife to her mother's for Thanksgiving in Syracuse.  Tuesday<br/>
was last-minute shopping and drive down day.<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday I took off for Green Lake Park.  No admission fee during the <br/>
winter months.  The parking lot that's mentioned in "Noodles in a<br/>
Basket" is closed for the winter.  Instead of turning right at the<br/>
ticket station, turn left, park and walk to the other parking lot.<br/>
This will add about 1/4 mile to your hike.  I found "Noodles" without<br/>
a problem.  If you're going after "The Gambler" series, there's a<br/>
point on the trail where some trees have fallen down.  You have to<br/>
walk up to the tree, eyeball the path until you find your next<br/>
landmark, then cut through the woods until you're back on the path and<br/>
backtrack to your landmark.  I found "Ace of Spades", "Ace of Clubs",<br/>
and "Ace of Hearts".  I returned to the car and drove to the Boathouse<br/>
parking lot.  Unfortunately, I didn't find "Ace of Diamonds" to<br/>
complete the set.  As a computer systems trouble shooter, I am<br/>
extremely literal minded.  Poetic clues like "trees that look like the<br/>
number eleven" and "the tree with the ugly trunk" are ambiguous to<br/>
me.  I found "Tom's Letterbox" without a problem.  I have to say that<br/>
Green Lake has a richer class of pigs than I've met elsewhere.  I<br/>
always take a litter bag and fill it with whatever trash I find on the<br/>
trail.  This time, the garbage included empty champagne, cold duck and<br/>
brandy bottles.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday was Turkey Day.  While the women cooked, I tackled the<br/>
"Honeydew" list that my mother-in-law has been writing since Mother's<br/>
Day. :D  The feast was excellent!<br/>
<br/>
Friday I left for Clark Reservation Park.  I found "It's Good for a<br/>
Dog Walk" without a problem.  I was also First Finder for "Little<br/>
Jewel"! Yippee!  I was just a little disappointed because "Dog Walk"<br/>
was stamped by "Honeymoon HH" with the notation that it was too large<br/>
to fit in the box, so they didn't leave it. I returned to the park<br/>
entrance to track down the "That Darn Cat" Alice in Wonderland series.<br/>
 At this point, I would have sworn under oath in court that I was<br/>
completely alone in the entire park.  The only other car that I had<br/>
seen was leaving when I arrived.  I found "The White Rabbit" and<br/>
discovered "Dolphin HH" sharing it's hiding place! I had a hitchhiker<br/>
after all!  I went to the picnic bench and opened everything up.  At<br/>
that point, a small child called out, "Mom! We're not alone in the<br/>
park!" and a horde of children descended on me.  Literally, descended.<br/>
 The trail went uphill and they were charging down the hill towards<br/>
me!  They swarmed around me and began picking up the log books and the<br/>
stamps and looking through everything and asking me a thousand<br/>
questions.  Their parents came down the trail a moment later and<br/>
de-swarmed me. :D  There were only five children, it just seemed like<br/>
a hundred.  I spent about twenty minutes explaining what I was doing<br/>
and how letterboxing worked.  They asked if children could participate<br/>
in this and I showed them a stamp in the log book by "Maggie - Age 4".<br/>
 I handed them several of the info sheets that were in White Rabbit's<br/>
box.  They said when they got home they would check this out because<br/>
it seemed like a good way to keep the kids interested in their hikes.<br/>
They continued on down the trail I had come up. Ah, there is a<br/>
traveller's box for recruiters, right?  Whaddya mean no?!?  Oh, well.<br/>
 I logged into "White Rabbit" returned things to their place and<br/>
continued on.  I found "March Hare" and logged in.  When I continued<br/>
on to "Red Queen" I found that portion of the trail had been closed<br/>
for the winter. There was a fence across the stairs and it was chained<br/>
in place.  I checked the rest of the clues to see if any of the others<br/>
were on open trails.  They weren't.  <br/>
<br/>
I returned home and had dinner with my family.  After dinner, I<br/>
went out to the bar to meet "Alice".  See what letterboxing leads to?<br/>
Philandering!  I was leaving my wife at home and meeting strange women<br/>
in bars! :D  I have to say it's the easiest letterbox I've ever found.<br/>
 Because I had arrived just as the place opened, I was alone in the<br/>
bar. So I opened the box right on the bar.  The bartender didn't have<br/>
anything else to do so she watched me.  "Did anyone tell you what this<br/>
is all about?"  "No, I was just told to hand the box to anyone who<br/>
asked for Alice.  It's some kind of scavenger hunt?"  Well, sort of. <br/>
I then went on to explain letterboxing for the second time that day. <br/>
She also got a handout sheet. :D  I left space in my log book for<br/>
stamps #3, #4, and #5 in that series and stamped "Alice" in.<br/>
The stamps are gorgeous and I strongly recommend this series if you're<br/>
ever in Syracuse.  I'll be coming back around Mother's Day to get the<br/>
ones I missed.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday I was all set to go to Highland Forest.  Mother Nature<br/>
dropped six inches of snow, sub-zero temperatures and gusts up to 35<br/>
mph.  I stayed in and finished off the "Honeydew" list.  What can I<br/>
say, I'm a wussy pirate :D Ah well, Mother's Day is coming.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday we packed up and returned home.  I started letterboxing this<br/>
past April.  Because I live in a letterbox poor environment, I only<br/>
had 12 stamps to date.  If I gotten onto that last trail, I would<br/>
literally have doubled the number of stamps in my log book. Do I still<br/>
have "Dolphin HH"?  Or did I leave it somewhere in Syracuse?  I could<br/>
tell you, but then I'd have to make you walk the plank! <br/>

As for a recruiter box, that's a good theme.  How about a carving of a certain pirate pointing a la Uncle Sam, only with a crooked smile and wink?  <s>  Rogue Recruiter or something... Well? Get yer to whittlin', mate!<br/>

my typing error! :-)  Next time its the "Ace of Diamonds" or bust!<br/>
<br/>
The "Honeymoon HH" moseyed on to a spot somewhere between Syracuse &amp;<br/>
Cambridge, MA in October when we went to visit our son.  I don't know<br/>
if it's been found yet or not.   :-))  Guess some box checking will<br/>
have to be done!<br/>
<br/>
On your return you just might find more!!!<br/>
