The Cape Bretton Highland Park is a MUST...the closest to being in Scotland without leavign North America.  We had a wonderful trip and wish it has been longer.  We will be going back and will have to so some letterboxing up there now.  It used to be I would look for rubber stamp stores....now I add letterboxing to my list! LOL!!!<br/>
