Bar Gate Trail Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
          The Killingworth Conservation Land Trustss Bar Gate Trail is located in Killingworth just off of Bar Gate Trail Rd in the Indian Springs housing development.  It takes less than an hour to complete, the terrain is curvy but easy.<br/>
              From I-95 take exit 62 or 61, from 62 travel north aprox. three miles on Horse Pond Rd and Hammonaset Connector to the intersection of Route 79 where there is a blinking traffic light.  If you take exit 61-Route 79 follow roughly the same distance north to the same blinking light intersection.  Take the first left after the light which is Chestnut Hill Rd.  Proceed about .04 of a mile to your section left.  The new bridge you pass over is the Hammonasset River (you have now entered Killingworth).  Proceed up Bar Gate Trail to the first Rotary.  Park beside the road just before the rotary or anywhere.  The beginning of the trail is on the left just before the rotary, go in by the green steel utility box.  The blazes are red but tend to fade as the trail moves on.  <br/>
          The Trail proceeds down hill almost to the river and then makes a sharp left .  It winds along the river through a hemlock forest up and down the steep bank of the river.  In the Spring, the ground may be muddy in spots where you have to cross over small tributaries.  After about 15 or 20 minutes you will come to a small area of mountain laurel.  Soon after this you come out from the forest briefly onto a berm of earth.   Their is a smooth barked tree arcing the path with a blaze shortly below eye level, from this tree bout four or five steps right down a steep slope is a large over hanging boulder.  This is the head of the snapper that swallowed the bargate letterbox.  Deep under the over hand behind a (placed) large piece of bark the letterbox awaits your stamp.   Stamp in a proceed past a spring time vernal pool on the left. (This used to be the site of the town dump).   Soon you will return back into the forest.  The trail winds along the river and finally empties into a thicket of brambles and berry bushes which brings you back to  Bar Gate Trail.   Take a left for a 10 minute walk back to your car.     <br/>
