On the serious side, those of you planning to attend the meet and <br/>
greet should really go out and but some bug spray with deet.  With <br/>
the wave of West Nile Virus going around, better safe than sorry.  Be <br/>
sure to cover your entire body and clothes with the spray since those <br/>
little buggers can bite you through thin clothing.<br/>
<br/>
According to an article I read, a spray or lotion with 28% deet <br/>
should protect you for about 5 hours but after that you should <br/>
reapply.  Also, be aware that this will not stop the skeeters from <br/>
flying around you, it will just stop them from biting you.<br/>
<br/>
And if you are afraid of snakes, stay away from Psychomommy!  She <br/>
seems to be wearing Calvin Klein's "Here snaky, snaky" perfume.<br/>

Psychomommy posted that the ADG should put out a box <br/>
called "Mosquitos in my Pants" and I read it while I was eating <br/>
lunch.  Since I was trying to eat my sandwich and avoid scratching my <br/>
itchy, mosquito eaten legs at the time, I almost busted a gut <br/>
laughing.<br/>
<br/>
She was responding to the Itchy Butt Girls' idea of putting a box in <br/>
a place called "Sandy Bottom."<br/>
<br/>
You know how sometimes a joke bombs and you say "you had to be <br/>
there?"  Same situation.  <br/>
