<br/>
I have been conversing with Yorkshire Tortoise about finding my UK box <br/>
that was part of the Britain in America series (headed by catbead).<br/>
<br/>
I gave her the registration number and she and her friends checked the <br/>
latest Dartmoor 100 book and the box is not listed.<br/>
<br/>
Can you give me a head's up about where the (several) UK boxes that <br/>
were sent to you and registered by you ended up?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.<br/>

  Thanks for your email, it was nice to hear from you.<br/>
<br/>
  Unfortunately I have not been able to place the boxes as of yet.  Since the boxes were delivered by the bakers dozen I have been studying at university and have been unable to make the trip in order to place the boxes.  I have, in fact, only been to Dartmoor twice in the last 2 years, so my letterboxing career has to be well and truely put on hold.  However, this year is to be different and I have 2 planned visits to Dartmoor in the near future.  The first will hopefully be on the 18th Feb and the second being in early April.  If I can identify a suitable route for the boxes, prior to my visit,  then i shall place them on the 19th Feb - failing that I shall use the 19th to locate an appropriate route and place the boxes in April.  As the boxes will be making up a 'route' (due to the amount of stamps) I shall put together a route/clue sheet for them which will, obviousley, be made available for all those who supplied a stamp to pass on to whomever they wish.  They will<br/>
 also appear in the Dartmoor catalogue updates and then in the catalogue itself.<br/>
<br/>
  i realise that the delayed placing of the stamps will be frustrating for all concerned but I hope that you can understand my placing priority on my studies, in which i have uinvested a great deal of time and money.  <br/>
<br/>
  I have also, nearly, completed the carving of stamps to be sent to those who sent stamps over.<br/>
<br/>
  Kind Regards<br/>
  Andy<br/>

<br/>
We also hope you have a trip planned to Dartmoor on the third week of<br/>
September this year when The Bakers Dozen group + more visits the moor as<br/>
The Moor Tor-ists.<br/>
<br/>
Email me privately and we can discuss this further. I even planned for you<br/>
to have your own bed in 1 of the 2 cottages we've rented.<br/>
