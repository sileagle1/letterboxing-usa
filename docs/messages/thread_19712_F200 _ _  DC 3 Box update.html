also in the rain.<br/>
<br/>
I found Cornucopoia today, my 200th box.  It was the placer's first <br/>
placement.  Woo hoo.  Had to sit and wait for someone to finish <br/>
their lunch, and another to finish their cell phone conversation and <br/>
another to simply leave before I could retrieve it.<br/>
<br/>
THEN I walked across the street to borrow a pen from someone so I <br/>
could sign in (I'd left mine in the car) and when I returned there <br/>
were four more people taking a break so I sat and sat and sat and <br/>
FINALLY I put it back with none the wiser.<br/>
<br/>
Box 201 was Radio Days (sorry, didn't write anything - pen STILL in <br/>
the car)<br/>
<br/>
Box 202 was Teddy's Microbox. (Left the pen in the car, went back <br/>
and got it, found the box, stamped in, FORGOT I HAD THE PEN! and <br/>
didn't write anything.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks folks.  I've reached my goal for F this year.  Now I have to <br/>
get busy carving to reach my P goal of 50 by November 11.  (That's <br/>
33 boxes coming soon to VA/MD/DC by 11/11/4.)<br/>
