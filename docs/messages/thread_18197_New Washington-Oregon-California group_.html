&gt; created a Washington-Oregon-California group at:<br/>
<br/>
I hope this doesn't sound too harsh, but I fear this group is doomed <br/>
to failure from the moment it was conceived.  There's already a very <br/>
active Pacific Northwest board (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbPNW) <br/>
for Washington and Oregon with about 150 members, and I'd be very <br/>
surprised if they wanted to ditch that board for this new one.<br/>
<br/>
There's also already Northern and Southern California talk lists <br/>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbNCA and <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxing-socal) already going, <br/>
although admittedly not nearly as active as the Pacific Northwest <br/>
board.  I created a poll asking if those members wanted to combine <br/>
the two boards into a single California board, but the vote was <br/>
overwhelmingly for keeping the two boards separate.<br/>
<br/>
So combining all three of those boards into a single one--well, you <br/>
might get a few people to join the group out of curiosity (or <br/>
because they don't like me being a moderator on the other three <br/>
boards! *innocent smile*), but it's most likely going to be very <br/>
lonely by yourself on your new board.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was in favor of having one California group, so please consider that when you read this post. I believe Ryan is correct when he says that this new list is doomed to fail. It seems as though various data bases and new chat lists start up and then poop out.  Most folks don't like change and seem to get along just fine with the regional lists as they are presently set up. The SoCal list serves those in that area, NorCal list serves those that live in the northern part of the state and the lbPNW serves Oregon and Washington. For those that don't fit into a regional section(Kernville, Ca.for example) and have letterboxes scattered around in all sections we subscribe to the lists that interest us. That seems to work and I for one do not want more digests or posts piling up in our inbox than we presently have. If you need to communicate with the entire left coast the main chat list would certainly be your tool.<br/>
