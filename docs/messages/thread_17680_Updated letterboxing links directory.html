(http://www.letterboxing.info/links/). There are now 270+ links in 80+ <br/>
categories, with links to resources related to stamp carving, bookbinding, <br/>
news stories about letterboxing, and more.<br/>
<br/>
I've also included a list of the many new regional letterboxing discussion <br/>
groups that have sprung up around the country, as well as a list of <br/>
personal sites of letterboxers by state. If you have a personal <br/>
letterboxing site that you would like to have listed, please let me know -- <br/>
or, if your site is listed and you'd rather that it wasn't included, or <br/>
it's in the wrong state, write to me privately and I'll remove or fix it. <br/>
(You can use the site search tool to find the specific page on which your <br/>
site may be listed.)<br/>

Thank you for including our humble page in the Maine section of<br/>
personal letterboxing sites. I really appreciate that it's so easy to<br/>
navigate. I found our site without much trouble from your link in the<br/>
post!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again - good job!<br/>
