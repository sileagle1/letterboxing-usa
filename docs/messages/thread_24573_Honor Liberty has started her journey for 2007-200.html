begin her annual journey.  Her travels begin anew at:  "Martial Music, <br/>
War of the Rebellion: Hail Columbia" letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Per Don and Gwen's request and instructions, please DO post on this <br/>
list the name of the 'box at which you sign into and/or leave Honor <br/>
Liberty.  In August of 2009, please send her back to Don and Gwen <br/>
(instructions are in the log books).<br/>
<br/>
What a superb tribute to all the victims of our national tragedy:  <br/>
those killed that day, their families, the emergency responders and <br/>
those who searched the rubble in the aftermath.  Thanx Don and Gwen.<br/>
