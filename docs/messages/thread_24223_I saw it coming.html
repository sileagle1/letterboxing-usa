There is not an organization for contact person(s)that represent <br/>
letterboxing. There's no official organization that a land manager <br/>
can deal with. If you look at other outdoor based organizations, <br/>
they all go to great pains to cooperate with public land managers. <br/>
Do you think a Boy Scout doing a service project is just going to <br/>
walk onto public lands and either nail up bird houses or build a <br/>
bridge without talking to a ranger first? <br/>
<br/>
Once I finish my Masters program, I'll have more time to get <br/>
involved again. If I chose to do it, my first activity will be to <br/>
reach out to public land managers and to make a clear break with the <br/>
clandestine element in the letterbox community. <br/>

While not commenting on the merits of letterboxing organizing, your <br/>
comment about YOU reaching out to land managers seems a little <br/>
presumptious.<br/>

Please, before you or anyone else goes running off trying to speak for <br/>
the whole of letterboxing, make sure you know of which you speak or <br/>
you could make things even worse than they already are.<br/>
<br/>
There currently is a semi-formal procedure for contact with the <br/>
letterboxing community and administrators, via a link from <br/>
letterboxing.org.  These messages go to a group of very dedicated <br/>
webmasters who answer each e-mail from land managers and parks and <br/>
other property owners and accidental box finders and attempt to make <br/>
contact with letterbox owners for removal, etc. as necessary.  Just <br/>
because you don't see anything actively happening, does not mean it is <br/>
not going on behind the scenes.<br/>
<br/>
I shuddered at your last comment, "make a clear break with the <br/>
clandestine element in the letterbox community."  Scary that somebody <br/>
who can make a statement like that, which clearly demonstrates that <br/>
you do not thoroughly understand letterboxing, thinks he is capable of <br/>
negotiating policies for the entire community.<br/>

<br/>
 We are dinosaurs, didn't you know that "Family Fun" magazine has<br/>
decided that this was a "fun excuse for families to get outside" and<br/>
not the game "we" love. <br/>
<br/>
 I'm not sure if I need an "excuse" but it would seem that most of<br/>
those playing the game these days do.<br/>
<br/>
 "Stupid is as Stupid does"<br/>
<br/>
 The best thing that could come out of these people that feel the need<br/>
to "reach out to public land managers" is for them to fail in their<br/>
efforts. Maybe then all the "land managers" will get together and<br/>
decide that any property left behind by an individual is litter, and<br/>
therefore, civil disobedience. Once it becomes an unlawful act to<br/>
plant a letterbox, the "Mom's" will go away. And we can get back to<br/>
the game "the clandestine element" loves.<br/>
<br/>
 I can't help but think that the original LbNA site always "hinted" at<br/>
the thought that there might be something actually hidden at the spot<br/>
that the clues pointed to. Now with the feature of someone actually<br/>
being able to verify that someone else, has in fact, placed what, by<br/>
law, can be considered trash, in public domain, the thought of a law<br/>
suit rears it's ugly head.<br/>
<br/>
 I can only hope that those responsible for the changes in the<br/>
difference of the concept of a certain web site being a "store house"<br/>
of clues to letterboxes, and a place to "database" the actual<br/>
activity, i.e: a list of finders, has been blurred and that they in<br/>
fact are the parties to be held in account of our activities.<br/>
<br/>
 It is for this basic fact that I have removed my clues from both of<br/>
the main clue sites, I no longer was in control of what my clues<br/>
content contained.        <br/>

I feel similarly, Brian. I like for the location of my boxes to be  protected <br/>
and respected by those who seek them. I therefore only place the  name of the <br/>
box and the city in which it is located on my online listing. I  prefer to <br/>
use Atlas Quest because it allows me to choose an F-count for the  people <br/>
looking for boxes in the area (don't get me wrong, I enjoy LbNA as well,  but that <br/>

hobby are the ones who receive the clues. :o)<br/>

Hmm.<br/>
<br/>
Several assumptions there. <br/>
I can't quibble with the fact that apparently some clues are only<br/>
available to those who log online. But, I dare guess that "some of the<br/>

I think you probably have to know where to look.<br/>

logging one's finds onto atlasquest is a "requirement" to being considered a<br/>
boxer who "cares about the hobby," is there anything on atlasquest to<br/>
prevent someone from going thru and recording finds for a couple of hundred<br/>
boxes or so just for kicks to play with the system?  We already have clues<br/>
posted for a box in this area, clues for a box that doesn't exist, clues<br/>
posted, according to the neighbors of the teens, supposedly so that some<br/>
teens can videotape boxers' frustrations at not being able to find the box<br/>
and put the video on the internet. Smile, you're on candid camera.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
2. How does someone having found 1 box, 10 boxes, 100 boxes, etc. prove they<br/>
care ANYthing about the hobby in regards to caring about other boxers?  It<br/>
proves they care about finding boxes.  It never demonstrates that they care<br/>
about finding boxes responsibly so that the boxers who come along to find<br/>
that box after them can enjoy that box too.  I've come along fairly quickly<br/>
behind some of our veteran boxers in the past and found boxes left in<br/>
not-too-good shape.  Yes, someone could have come along in-between us and<br/>
found the box, didn't put anything in the logbook and was negligent with the<br/>
box, but with the timing and all, it's not that likely.<br/>
<br/>
3. But they're your boxes, Three Hearts, and nobody can ever take 'em away<br/>
from ya.  Well, yeah, I guess they can, just make sure you log into<br/>
atlasquest once a year, but since you log your finds at atlasquest,<br/>
obviously you're there at least once a year.   But they're your boxes and<br/>
whatever works for ya.  Whether it really works or whether it doesn't really<br/>
work but it gives ya a false sense of security, whatever system works for<br/>
ya, they're your boxes.  When it comes to blood pressure readings, a false<br/>
sense of security is just as good as a real sense of security.  They both<br/>
work just as well as either Valium or sleeping pills.<br/>

Add my name to those unqualified to find your letterboxes. Data entry<br/>
isn't my idea of a good time letterboxing. Funny that should label me<br/>
as one who doesnt' care about my hobby. Sigh... Funhog (boxing since 2001)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I prefer to <br/>
&gt; use Atlas Quest because it allows me to choose an F-count for the <br/>
people <br/>
&gt; looking for boxes in the area (don't get me wrong, I enjoy LbNA as<br/>
well, but that <br/>
&gt; one feature sways my listings). I feel that asking a letterboxer <br/>
to meet one <br/>
&gt; of a few simple requirements helps to ensure that people who care<br/>
about the <br/>
&gt; hobby are the ones who receive the clues. :o)<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;stamp days, we now have a situation where Drewclan,  Mapsurfer, the <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Greendragons and Phyto don't qualify to see some  of the more creative <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;clues because they don't log their finds  online. And it's hard to <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;find their clues because they are  trying to keep them from being <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;logged as  finds.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;The dinosaurs may become extinct, but they  will probably die laughing <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;at the concept of a MYSTERY clue that  you can ONLY see if your every <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;move is tracked on a  database.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;y-nought<br/>
<br/>
Completely understood, and that's why I said I felt "similarly". There are  <br/>
just enough people who are *not* like the beloved dinosaurs &amp; protectors of  <br/>
the game that I feel that the solution that I personally have come up with for  <br/>
my boxes seems to be effective. Personally, I enjoy logging my finds online  <br/>
because it's easier for me to record that way - not because I think some other  <br/>
person will be impressed or anything like that. It's just for *me*. If <br/>
someone  wants my clues that does not use either of the two big sites, all they have <br/>
to  do is ask. Just think of them as WOM clues, in that regard. :o) It's just <br/>
that  around here there are a lot of people who deliberately do harm to <br/>
letterboxes,  and it helps to try my best to filter them out, kwim?<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;as many stamps in my books as possible. Putting  a<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;restriction on a letter box until a person  becomes<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;more experenced at finding the clues, in my mind,  is<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;the most stupidest thing in this game. It is  very<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;elitest. Why not just put a box out in the woods  and<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;do not make up any clues. <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I will never put an  F-count restriction on any of<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;my boxes. I have alot of stamps in  my book but no time<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;to list them in on the computer. The letter  boxing<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;sites are there to find  clues.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Bicyling George <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm so happy to hear that you are comfortable with the feeling that your  <br/>
boxes will not be mistreated! That's wonderful! <br/>
<br/>
Where I live, there have been several instances of park rangers logging  onto <br/>
the main sites to get the clues to the boxes in their parks and going out  to <br/>
remove them!!! There have also been reports of very unkind individuals who  <br/>
just want to damage boxes - why, I don't know. <br/>
<br/>
I find that putting an F-count restriction of *1* (one) helps to prevent  <br/>
that from happening to my boxes. I don't find that low a number (one find)  <br/>
elitist at all. I wouldn't make it any higher, though. I want people to find my  <br/>
boxes, just not the people who want to hurt them. I would never keep my clues  <br/>
away from anyone who asked for them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your response, George!!! :o)<br/>

You're not remotely unqualified. Like I mentioned to Bicycling George,  <br/>
anyone who asks for the clues can have them. They just have to ask. I'm sorry  that <br/>
you interpreted my attempt to explain my reasoning as "labeling" you. That  <br/>
is not the case. A "person who cares about the hobby" is any individual who  <br/>
chooses to find a letterbox for the purpose on enjoying it. One who does not  <br/>
care about the hobby would be someone who was seeking clues for the  purpose of <br/>
damaging the boxes - which happens a LOT down here. That certainly  isn't you, <br/>
right? :o)<br/>
<br/>
I think that I must not have explained myself as clearly as I thought I  did. <br/>
Hopefully my responses will clear up my position on the topic. <br/>
<br/>

I don't agree, WOM allows you to control who finds your box because<br/>
you can give it only to people you know and trust. An Fcount<br/>
requirement (which by deffinition IS all about the numbers and only<br/>
about the numbers) tells you nothing other than the person is obsessed<br/>
about collecting stamps which doesn't tell you they're concerned about<br/>
leaving no trace or not ripping apart the flora in a single minded<br/>
quest for one more stamp or that they won't find a ranger and demand<br/>
that he show them where the box is in his park or send you a<br/>

For all the accusations of elitism that get thrown around on this site<br/>
I'm amazed that anyone uses this feature and besides, that's what your<br/>

If the Fcount feature is not about the numbers what possible dimension<br/>
does counting numbers add that is not about the numbers??? <br/>

<br/>
  I guess I like online statistics. It's easy to keep an accurate count on AQ (as a premium member). I also like the convenience of opening up my AQ account and seeing at a glance which boxes I've found, all kinds of letterboxes too -letterboxes on the geocaching site, the LBNA site, on other websites and WOM boxes. <br/>
<br/>
  Recording finds on AQ also makes it easier to search for local boxes, I can set up my search to exclude boxes I have found. I believe LBNA works this way as well i.e. it doesn't display boxes that I have marked as found.<br/>
<br/>
  I've planted 39 letterboxes and I really appreciate it when people log their finds, to me it says I think you letterbox is worthy of acknowledgment. I also see the logged finds as a useful tool for other finders - it tells them that the box was there on the date it was logged. This is especially handy when the owner does not respond to email or has dropped out of the game.<br/>

&gt; It's not just about the numbers. Some people use that feature to add a<br/>

a box<br/>
&gt; at AQ is the same thing as having a WOM box you only give to those<br/>
that XYZ.<br/>
<br/>
I don't agree, WOM allows you to control who finds your box because<br/>
you can give it only to people you know and trust. An Fcount<br/>
requirement (which by deffinition IS all about the numbers and only<br/>
about the numbers) tells you nothing other than the person is obsessed<br/>
about collecting stamps which doesn't tell you they're concerned about<br/>
leaving no trace or not ripping apart the flora in a single minded<br/>
quest for one more stamp or that they won't find a ranger and demand<br/>
that he show them where the box is in his park or send you a<br/>
nasty-gram accusing you of having the clues wrong.<br/>

each play the game and try to protect our beloved boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I think the part that many people miss is that all I ask is that <br/>
someone meet *one* of the requirements, not *all* of them. They are all <br/>
very simple and exclude very few people. I've received requests from <br/>
people who felt they didn't meet any of them, and they still got the <br/>
clues. The idea is to dissuade the interest of those seeking to harm <br/>
them. I don't see anything wrong with that, kwim?<br/>

Not to beat a dead horse, but how exactly do you envision "reaching out<br/>
to public land managers?"<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxers aren't an "outdoor based organization" and can't be<br/>
compared to one. It is an activity- like mountain biking, or kite<br/>
flying, or any number of other activities people do in parks. The<br/>
placement of a box is in no way equivocal to a boy scout service<br/>
project.<br/>
<br/>
I am a public lands manager. I do appreciate knowing what is going on in<br/>
my parks- people often damage resources inadvertently, and if I can give<br/>
some guidance on boxing more carefully, then I think it is a benefit to<br/>
both the resource and to the boxing community.  But keeping it in scale,<br/>
I have many bigger problems out there than hidden tupperware.<br/>
<br/>
Place your boxes with care, be respectful of the environment, and write<br/>
your email address in the box so a land manager can contact you directly<br/>
if they have a problem.  Don't box where you know it is expressly<br/>
forbidden.  We don't need to be an official organization to be<br/>
reputable.<br/>

Place your boxes with care, be respectful of the environment, and write<br/>
your email address in the box so a land manager can contact you directly<br/>
if they have a problem. Don't box where you know it is expressly<br/>
forbidden. We don't need to be an official organization to be<br/>
reputable.<br/>
