</p><p>  Please post the following new letterboxes to the site. 
</p><p>Many Thanks!</p>
<p>My name is Edna Daugherty and I have recently placed 2 letterboxes in the Starved Rock Area. I would like to see these posted to the LBNA site under the state of Illinois.</p>
<p>Name of Letterbox is Starved Rock Lodge #1</p>
<p>Date placed april 24, 2002</p>
<p>Located in LaSalle County</p>
<p>Located in the State of Illinois</p>
<p>Closed city is Utica</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Clues</p>.
<p>There are 23 chainsaw Wood Carvings at the Lodge. Start at the only one that was carved by Peter "Wolf" Toth in 1989.</p>
<p>*Hint: Go to the front desk in the Lodge and receive the Art in the Park brochure. Save the brochure, it will come in handy</p>
<p>2. Proceed westbound on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>3. Lounge with the "Stargazer" and follow his right.</p>
<p>4. Not the Lodge,</p>
<p>Not the Hotel.</p>
<p>Go toward,</p>
<p>Tonti and DeLaSalle.</p>
<p>5. Pass DeLaSalle, at the T take a right.</p>
<p>6. Go over the flagstones and onto the bricks.</p>
<p>7. Go smooth to the East when you greet the man at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>8. Of all the entryways find the one with the shape of "Land of Lincoln" Enter. Beware it may be hidden underneath.</p>
<p>9. Have a seat with the 2 brown bears. Look 45 degrees to the right.</p>
<p>10. Its not in a cupboard,</p>
<p>or behind a door.</p>
<p>Use your best guess,</p>
<p>and open a drawer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Established April 24, 2002</p>
<p>Starved Rock Lodge #2 </p>
<p>Clues</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the veranda under your feet,</p>
<p>There is a stone so very unique</p>
<p>It points to a view that can not be beat,</p>
<p>So take a walk or a drive, you'll need to take a peak!</p>
<p>A quarter is the fee,</p>
<p>Eighteen point five is the key.</p>
<p>Across where the Bald Eagles feed,</p>
<p>It's in the building behind the four-fifty.</p>
<p>Driving is required to find the man</p>
<p>He wears a fedora because he can.</p>
<p>Remember our previous plan,</p>
<p>And search in the building for the number at hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Congratulations, you have just found Starved Rock Lodge's 2nd Letterbox!!</p>
