<br/>
Why is it that in the cold by yourself short hikes seem like <br/>
forever?  It always seems longer when you're not sure where you are <br/>
going.  I'm always amused when clues lead you all the way around the <br/>
park and then back, almost to where you started, for the box.  I <br/>
really enjoyed the 'walk along the log' clue in Nottoway Park.  <br/>
Never mind it was the 2nd time I'd been there looking for it.  <br/>
<br/>
The people at that Vienna recycling center must have wondered what I <br/>
was doing sitting on the quartz boulder in the cold with notepads <br/>
and stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
It's also fun when clues work perfectly in the wrong place.  More <br/>
than one sewer manhole cover pointing in the same direction to just <br/>
the same kind of bush.  But I found and said bye to Rusty after <br/>
all.  Careful rereading of the clues often clears up ambiguities.<br/>
<br/>
Then I decided it was time to go look for "The Mole".  I'd driven <br/>
through Vienna and around it so many times while waiting for a <br/>
friend who wanted to go with me but I couldn't drive past it yet <br/>
another time and not go.  Do you know the end walk on Survivor where <br/>
the last two contestants walk a long hike past memories of <br/>
their 'fallen' comrades?  The walk to the Mole is long enough and <br/>
through such innocent suburban scenery of backyards, playgrounds and <br/>
creeks to play in, that you have time to reflect just what this <br/>
traitor was risking for his avarice.  By the way one of the clues <br/>
has rusted, broken and been moved around: the yellow smile guy.  But <br/>
you can still figure out the way.  Negotiating changed conditions or <br/>
detours are part of the hunt and the fun.  Nice stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
Too cold and dark?  Not if you're searching in a library.  Who would <br/>
have thought that a hunt in a library could be so much fun?  The <br/>
Bull Run library letterboxes in Manassas led me on a merry chase <br/>
through different worlds of arachnids, cookery, ballet, and whatever <br/>
caught my eye and distracted me.  The Rocky Horror book? All the <br/>
while seemingly being chased by the mad librarian "the <br/>
straightener".  It seemed that when I found a letterbox book and sat <br/>
down suddenly "the mad straightener" would appear circling me while <br/>
I tried to be discrete stamping in.  I didn't know what I feared <br/>
more: her noticing and wondering what I was doing or her discovering <br/>
the box books on the shelves before I could find them!  <br/>
<br/>
Did you know that an index search for spider turns up so many hits <br/>
on Spiderman it's hard to find the location of spider books?  Did <br/>
you know the pet section, between the aquarium fish and the cats, <br/>
has a book on tarantulas?  And just how many rows of books can you <br/>
scan before you realize you should read the clues more carefully and <br/>
use your brain to look instead of your hurried assumptions?  Hmmm, <br/>
but this cookbook by medical examiner mystery novelist Patricia <br/>
Cornwell looks interesting.  "The library will be closing in 30 <br/>
minutes."  Scramble.<br/>

<p>O.K. -- first they move the trashcan at Wolf Trails playground (a few feet down and to the other side of the sidewalk) and now they've relocated our yellow smiley guy?!  What's a clue writer to do?  Here we thought we were being safe choosing something metal and way cemented into the ground as a landmark....  Oh well!  Thanks for the heads up.  We will go check it out and revise the clues.  I'm glad you could figure out what the stamp was.  It was our first hand carved one.  BeMa</p></div>
<p>P.S.  We are looking forward to checking out your new stamp in the nice, warm mall.  We hope you stay warm and enjoy looking for our latest box on another cold Vienna playground...<br/><br/></p>
