<br/>
You Will Need A CD Player To Get The Full Effect Of This Letterboxing <br/>
Experience!!!<br/>
<br/>
At the Main Entrance you will see a sculpture of Israel Putnam riding <br/>
a horse down a flight of stairs.  You will also see two guard towers <br/>
with Revolutionary War cannons in front.  This is where you should <br/>
park your car.<br/>
<br/>
Walk up the hill to the Monument. Be sure to read all the <br/>
inscriptions, as they are very interesting.  When you have finished <br/>
face the side of the monument that reads "the men of '76 who suffered <br/>
here to preserve forever their memory.  The state of Connecticut has <br/>
erected this monument AD 1888".  From this position head north and <br/>
follow the road counter clockwise. <br/>
<br/>
Once you are back on the road you will notice heaps of rock.  They <br/>
are the only visible remains of the barracks.  The stone is from the <br/>
firebacks from each log hut, which held 8-12 men.  These huts were <br/>
burnt down when the troops left so that their enemy could not use <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Almost at the end of the firebacks you will see to the right an <br/>
entrance to the museum.<br/>
Shortly after the first entrance you will find a second entrance on <br/>
the right.  This leads to the museum and the North entrance of the <br/>
park.<br/>
<br/>
Directly across from the second museum entrance on the left you will <br/>
find the Site of Officers Quarters.  All that remains is a stone <br/>
chimney.  It is here that you will find the Putnam Memorial State <br/>
Park Letterbox #1.<br/>
<br/>
With your back to the chimney of the officer's quarter take the <br/>
reading of 300 NW.  Walk fourteen paces in that direction to a large <br/>
oak tree with moss at its base.  Facing the great oak turn North.  <br/>
Walk eighteen paces in this direction to an oak that has been <br/>
hollowed out at its base.  The Putnam Memorial State Park Letterbox <br/>
#1 is hidden under some rocks to the North side of the tree.  Once <br/>
you have stamped in, rehide the box and proceed back to the road.  <br/>
<br/>
Continue heading counter clockwise around the circle.  As the road <br/>
bends to the left you will notice sites #3 &amp; #4 to your right and <br/>
left respectively.  To the right (site #3) you will see the Magazine; <br/>
the site of a structure built by the soldiers to store gunpowder.  To <br/>
the left (site #4) is Phillip's Cave.  Please observe the sign, which <br/>
reads, "These Rocks Are Dangerous  DO NOT CLIMB".  There are no <br/>
letterboxes hidden in the caves but feel free to explore for a while.<br/>
<br/>
When you have finished exploring Phillip's Cave proceed up the hill <br/>
to site #5, which is the Site of Officers Quarters.  As you proceed <br/>
southward and up the hill to your right is a large outcropping of <br/>
rock.  It is here that you will find Putnam Memorial State Park <br/>
Letterbox #2.<br/>
<br/>
Head behind the outcropping and face towards the road.  At the far <br/>
left side of the boulders a stone wall connects.  Here you will find <br/>
a medium size boulder that is pinned in place between the outcropping <br/>
and a rotting tree trunk.  The Putnam Memorial State Park Letterbox <br/>
#2 is hidden underneath this rock and is blocked from view by two <br/>
slabs of black rock with white stripes running down the center.  <br/>
Please move the rocks carefully as this is a historic site and should <br/>
be preserved as best as possible.  When you have finished stamping <br/>
return the box to it's hiding place making sure it is carefully <br/>
hidden and head back to the road.<br/>
<br/>
Continue to head south along the road.  You will pass Barlow Circle <br/>
on the left.  This circle is named for Joel Barlow of Redding who was <br/>
a poet and statesman.  Later along the road you will come across the <br/>
Oven Foundation were bread was baked for the troops.<br/>
<br/>
After the second stretch of road lined by a rock wall you will come <br/>
across a second monument on your left.  This monument was dedicated <br/>
to the men who died in Putnam's Camp.  The monument reads, "In memory <br/>
of the unknown heroes buried here."<br/>
<br/>
As you continue on the road you come to the entrance of the Youth <br/>
Group Camping Area (by permit only).  Follow the road into the Youth <br/>
Group Camping Area.  As you continue up the hill you will come to <br/>
Campsite A2.  Here you will find Putnam Memorial State Park Letterbox <br/>
#3.<br/>
<br/>
Plot a course following a straight path using the A2 sign and the <br/>
flagpole as a guide.  Behind the underbrush is a rock wall.  Still <br/>
using the sign and flagpole for your bearing, the Putnam Memorial <br/>
State Park Letterbox #3 is hidden in the rock wall.  The spot can be <br/>
seen from behind the wall and is hidden by a pink and gray rock <br/>
amongst black and white boulders.<br/>
<br/>
Take the box to the open hill.  Stamp in and enjoy Putnam's Camp by <br/>
Charles Ives just as it was intended.  When you have finished, return <br/>
the box to its hiding place.  Leave the Youth Group Camping Area and <br/>
continue down the hill to your car.<br/>
