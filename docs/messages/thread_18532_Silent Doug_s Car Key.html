I guess *some* people would find this funny....<br/>
<br/>
(just kidding, you had me rolling on the floor with laughter!)<br/>
<br/>
Every time I deny that I'm forgetful or lose things often, I promptly <br/>
forget or lose something, so I won't say anything this time!<br/>
<br/>
Hope your Kernville gathering was fun for all!<br/>

Everyone at the Kernville gathering thought this would be one of <br/>
those HHers that just keeps going and going and going. Your key was <br/>
found and each new finder should let us know where it is every time <br/>
it is found. <br/>
<br/>
We put your card on the mantle so you were there in spirit.<br/>
