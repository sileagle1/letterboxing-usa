<div></div>I tried to email this to the address link in the FAQ's that you wanted the 
<div></div>clues sent to you as well as posting them. However it came back as 
<div></div>undeliverable unable to contact. So I am sendin it to this link. Hopefully I 
<div></div>got the right one. Or even the right person. 
<div></div>
<div></div>I first found out about this letterboxing, from an article in a magazine in a 
<div></div>US Airways aircraft during a flight. I went to the website mentioned in it and 
<div></div>became hooked. Here is my first attempt. I am working on my second box already, 
<div></div>Unfortunatly I haven't been able to start seaching but hopefully will soon.

<p>My apologies. You are absoloutely correct. I just assumed that since he was new that he did not know about putting the info in the subject line. I am sincerely sorry if I have overstepped my bounds on this one.<br/></p></div>
