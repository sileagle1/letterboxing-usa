                    <div class="plaintext-content">Night Owl and Scarab really enjoyed these two series, on opposite <br/>
sides of our "world" (the DC area).<br/>
<br/>
Hurricane Isabel made boxing very challenging.  Fallen trees, <br/>
washouts of bridges, paths and boxes, whether real or suspected.<br/>
<br/>
In the Woods we never found the first of the series.  We were <br/>
looking for a fallen tree in the clues among so many new fallen <br/>
trees.  Found an old looking root stock but had no luck.  Really <br/>
enjoyed the rest of the series though and the Woods theme.  Stood in <br/>
the forest while hundreds of migrating birds (grackels?) made <br/>
cacaphony of motion and sound overhead.  One of those "moments" that <br/>
reminds us why we're out there.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My Dear Watson really challenged our perseverance.  Originally tried <br/>
it in 6" of snow last January.  Decided leaving so many tracks all <br/>
over was not a good idea.  Box 1 was buried completely under snow as <br/>
well as the log it was hidden in!  Found it anyway and gave up for <br/>
warmer weather.  <br/>
<br/>
Returned in August with Cozy and Night Owl.  If you don't know this <br/>
series it has cleverly written "prose" clues that are a challenge to <br/>
follow.  As usual they work better if you read what they say and not <br/>
what you assume they are saying.  After they refound the 1st box <br/>
they gave up on the second and fled from the flying little <br/>
vampires.  We vowed to return.<br/>
<br/>
Returned in October with Night Owl and plenty of time (needed).  No <br/>
luck still finding box 2.  Saw a perfectly good place for it, <br/>
matching the description great, but no luck.  Seemed missing.  <br/>
Trudged on.  We got confused by the trail markings.  Thought it <br/>
forked and went through the swamp.  That's right we went through and <br/>
around the swamp for an hour trying to figure out where we were.  We <br/>
were confused by a lot of washed out trail bridges and <br/>
boardwalks.  "Look, it's all been washed out by Isabel!"  Saw a lot <br/>
of beaver activity.  Finally gave up and headed back, only to see <br/>
another hiker go a different way.  Thinking we might have been all <br/>
wrong we headed off that way and onto the right track.  <br/>
<br/>
Found box 3 without only a little trouble, really enjoying it's <br/>
placement.  We liked reading in the log how so many people had a lot <br/>
of trouble finding it and we didn't, "Found box 4 easily before we <br/>
came back and finally found 3."  That came back to haunt us when we <br/>
couldn't find box 4.  Searched and searched around the swamp.  We <br/>
thought the "barrier" was the swamp!  Another Isobel victim!  But <br/>
wait, these people found it after Isabel.  <br/>
<br/>
Gave up and went on to box 5.  Easy find.  There we read again how <br/>
easy it was to find box 4, the one we couldn't find.  We also read <br/>
the that planter, Celtic Pride, had checked all the boxes just a <br/>
couple weeks before, After Isabel.  <br/>
<br/>
We'd blamed Isabel for taking the boxes and had falsely given up.<br/>
<br/>
Now determined, though getting late, we went all the way back <br/>
looking for 4 and even 2.  They must be here somewhere.  Reread and <br/>
reinterpret the clues.  "Wait, shouldn't this be horizontal and not <br/>
vertical?  Couldn't the barrier be something other than the swamp?"  <br/>
Giving up our preconceived notions we found 2 and 4 after all, <br/>
pretty easily.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a great fall day in the woods.<br/>

We too really enjoyed this hunt. We must have been there right before you,<br/>
because we found Box 5 before we found Box 4. <br/>
Saw and heard a bald eagle at Box 4. <br/>
If you enjoyed this series, you should also try the other series Celtic Pride<br/>
placed: at Cederville State Park. A real treat.<br/>
