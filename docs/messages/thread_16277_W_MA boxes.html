You could, as a temporary fix, change the county for your Franklin <br/>
County boxes to Hampshire. That way the county would be <br/>
wrong but the towns and directions would be correct and they <br/>
would show up in the western Mass section.<br/>

I've brought this to the attention of the webmasters<br/>
before, but no luck getting it fixed so far. <br/>
<br/>
And while I've got your attention, Bonnie, did you<br/>
know that your Wendell boxes are listed twice, once in<br/>
Hampshire County, and once in Franklin County? <br/>

They are actually in Franklin County. Which puts them<br/>
in with some great company. The boxes around the<br/>
Quabbin are both plentiful and beautiful.<br/>
