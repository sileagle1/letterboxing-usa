This is an often thankless job that requires a surprising amount of <br/>
dedication. I suspect most people on the list would be surprised at <br/>
the amount of spam and pornography these folks deflect, while they <br/>
also work diligently to ensure a comfortable place for us to talk <br/>
about our favorite subject.<br/>
<br/>
I think the link Choi provided to the updated list policies is <br/>
excellent and appreciate the thoughtfulness and work that went into <br/>
making it. At the same time, I happen to disagree with one of the <br/>
policies:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<related <br="" and="" hitchhikers,="" hobbies:="" letterboxing="" postal="" virtual="">
letterboxing are separate hobbies that evolved from traditional <br/>
letterboxing and posts related to those hobbies should usually be <br/>
made into lists or forums related to those hobbies.&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I've never been a fan of the fracturing of letterboxing lists into <br/>
smaller and more focused groups. I personally think that discussion <br/>
of hitch hikers, personal travelers, cooties, mosquitos, cuckoos, <br/>
postals, virtuals, exchanges, gatherings, and whatever creative <br/>
concept comes next from the mind of a happy letterboxer should be <br/>
completely welcome here on the big list. <br/>
<br/>
These aren't "related hobbies" the way geocaching, stone stashing, <br/>
benchmarking, bookcrossing, found art, freecycling, confluencing or <br/>
ecoscavenging are. These are Letterboxing, and this is letterbox-usa. <br/>
Now I'm not going to start posting 20 times on hitch hikers as a <br/>
protest, but I think it is perfectly okay to discuss all letterboxing <br/>
topics on this list. <br/>

that policy should be reworded. We might start by calling them<br/>
"letterboxing variations" rather than "related hobbies".<br/>

Jay, I think this may be the first time I have been on opposite sides<br/>
(only on a small point), but fracturing into smaller groups may be <br/>
more and more the way of the future. Currently there are 2589 listed <br/>
members and the smaller lists can provide enhancements to the main <br/>
list. I don't believe that someone should be totally restricted from <br/>
posting "anything" about "any" aspect of letterboxing here, but I <br/>
see no problem in asking that a lengthy conversation or signup <br/>
information on postal boxes be directed to postal list. When new <br/>
letterboxers post a "Howdy" on the mainlist I generally post <br/>
a "Howdy" back and include the Link to the Newboxers list as well as <br/>
our FAQS, Silent Dougs site and AQ.<br/>
Most new letterboxers are reluctant to post questions here and are <br/>
more comfortable in posting at the Newboxer site. At the same time <br/>
many folks can be a little put off reading about "What is a Hitch <br/>
Hiker?" for the umpteenth time, and with the concept that Mark set <br/>
up there, no one can get put off. I think the newboxer site is a <br/>
type of fracture that works, and works very well.<br/>
I think the roll of the main list changed greatly when the posting <br/>
of clues changed over to placer control, very similarly as the roll <br/>
changed after the formative period (new letterboxers see archives).<br/>
With the increase in numbers of letterboxers the main list will <br/>
probably have more changes in it's future.<br/>

  .....Special thanks to our letterbox-usa moderators! (Check out who's who <br/>
  This is an often thankless job that requires a surprising amount of <br/>
  dedication. I suspect most people on the list would be surprised at <br/>
  the amount of spam and pornography these folks deflect, while they <br/>
  also work diligently to ensure a comfortable place for us to talk <br/>
  about our favorite subject...... <br/>
<br/>
  .....I've never been a fan of the fracturing of letterboxing lists into <br/>
  smaller and more focused groups. I personally think that discussion <br/>
  of hitch hikers, personal travelers, cooties, mosquitos, cuckoos, <br/>
  postals, virtuals, exchanges, gatherings, and whatever creative <br/>
  concept comes next from the mind of a happy letterboxer should be <br/>
  completely welcome here on the big list. <br/>
<br/>
   but I think it is perfectly okay to discuss all letterboxing <br/>
  topics on this list...... <br/>
