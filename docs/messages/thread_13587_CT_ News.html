                    <div class="plaintext-content">It is a good thing that my wings are attached well , or I might lose <br/>
them.  As reported, Bluebird, Music Woman and I were in the Pomfret Area <br/>
yesterday letterboxing.  I carried my walking stick as I figured the <br/>
trails would be slippery and it came in handy.  Almost to the end of <br/>
Teach and Preach's new series, Jumble, I must have tired of picking up <br/>
all my stuff after stamping in, for I left my stick behind and only <br/>
noticed it missing when we were almost back to the car.  It is a special <br/>
stick and although I did hate losing it, decided not to go back looking. <br/>
Music Woman stopped at the Park headquarters and offered to pay the fee <br/>
if someone returned it. When I got home, I e mailed the Needeeps and <br/>
asked them to check in at the park when they had time.  This is what <br/>
they sent this morning,  ""<br/>
<br/>
Me and<br/>
Dan got up early and went looking for your stick,He went one way and I<br/>
the other.I went red all the way to camera and film and Dan went the<br/>
other way on blue and red.We met back in the parking area and Dan had<br/>
the stick in his hand,it was by box #16.""<br/>
<br/>
How cool it that ?? First I drop my keys in the dead of winter in deep snow in the forest and three days later Molly , the wonder dog digs them up. But you all know that story, now, this, I mean how lucky am I?? Finding a stick in the forest is something to ponder.  Thanks Kneedeeps, and I will retrieve it at the Summer Solstice in Mansfield.  What a celebration that will be.<br/>
A happy Butterfly <br/>
