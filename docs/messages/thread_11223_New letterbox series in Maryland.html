Placed by: Tempus Fugit<br/>
Number of boxes: 4<br/>
Date: March 15, 2003<br/>
Town: Boyds<br/>
County: Montgomery<br/>
State: MD<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Moderate; 2 stream crossings; several steep inclines; <br/>
might not be appropriate for small children; about 3 miles round <br/>
trip; get an early start; bring water<br/>
<br/>
Trail: Natural surface, hiking/mountain biking/horses; great for <br/>
birding; lots of deer<br/>
 (See http://www.mc-mncppc.org/trails/black_hill.shtm for map)<br/>
<br/>
Driving Directions: From Interstate 270, take exit 18 towards Boyds <br/>
(Rte. 121). After about 2 mi., you will see the brown sign indicating <br/>
a left turn on W. Old Baltimore Rd. to get to the main entrance of <br/>
Black Hill Regional Park. Do not turn left. Instead, make a sharp <br/>
RIGHT turn to head west on W. Old Baltimore Rd. (You are going to a <br/>
remote section of the park with a 3-loop trail.) Proceed about a half-<br/>
mile and turn left on Ten Mile Creek Rd. (gravel). Obey the signs and <br/>
park only on the right and before the private drive.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: Just beyond the metal gate is Ten Mile Creek. Depending on the <br/>
season/water level/your athletic ability, you may be able to jump <br/>
across. If not, carefully use the natural bridge. At the sign for <br/>
Turkey Hill Loop head to the right. At the top of the hill take a <br/>
rest on the bench. Thirty-three paces down from the bench there is a <br/>
deer trail on the left leading to a cluster of evergreen trees. Box <br/>
1, Aix sponsa, is at the base of the black pine.<br/>
<br/>
After carefully re-hiding Box 1, return to the trail and appreciate <br/>
the downhill stroll. At the bottom find a sign for Lake View Trail <br/>
and follow to the left. From the sign reading "To Osprey Heights <br/>
Loop" count 19 paces down that trail. Look to your left for a tall <br/>
multi-trunked tree about 7 paces off the trail. On the downhill side <br/>
of this tree, in a cleft, you will find Box 2, Drycopus pileatus. Be <br/>
discrete and carefully re-hide box 2.<br/>
<br/>
Return to the trail, heading downhill. Jump the small stream at the <br/>
bottom and head uphill again. Here's where you finally find the <br/>
Osprey Loop. Follow to the left. Shortly you will come to a split in <br/>
the trail  follow to the right. When you get to three cut logs on <br/>
either side of the trail, take a rest. Look in the base of the fallen <br/>
tree from which these logs were cut. Under a rock and some bark you <br/>
will find Box 3, Falco spevarious. Carefully re-hide and continue on <br/>
the loop.<br/>
<br/>
Soon you will come to another sign for the loop on your right. Stop <br/>
and face left toward a cornfield. Walk about 10 paces, then look for <br/>
a stump about 7 paces into the trees on the left. In the base of the <br/>
stump, behind some bark Box 4, Raphus cucullatus. A true rara avis!<br/>
<br/>
Complete this loop, going back the way you came. Follow the lakeshore <br/>
back to Ten Mile Creek and your car.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoyed your hike!<br/>
