<br/>
"The BLM believes that geocaching is an appropriate casual use of <br/>
public land.  But, as use increases or becomes a management issue in <br/>
a particular area, the following minimum steps should be taken:  1) <br/>
try to locate a person or group that is responsible for the cache <br/>
and have them register the cache with the BLM.  Make sure the cache <br/>
is safe and environmentally sound, 2) prepare an environmental <br/>
assessment or other appropriate National Environmental Protection <br/>
Act document, 3) issue a letter of authorization or SRP with special <br/>
stipulations to mitigate concerns, 4) if sites are not registered <br/>
within a reasonable amount of time after notification, then the <br/>
cache should be removed from public land, normally, the cache would <br/>
be determined to be abandoned property after 72 hours unless the <br/>
appropriate authorization has been obtained, 5) monitor the use to <br/>
assess public health and safety and environmental protection issues, <br/>
6) if the activity/sport becomes too large and begins to conflict <br/>
with other authorized use, appropriate steps should be taken to <br/>
properly manage the activity."<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That is an interesting memo. It seems like they are saying that <br/>
cacheing is fine for now, but they have the right to regulate it in <br/>
the future. <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion the BLM has their hands full with more high impact <br/>
users (i.e. off road vehicles). Most of the boxes in Colorado and <br/>
Utah that I have visited are on BLM or National Forest Service lands. <br/>
The National Parks are SO busy and expensive, they would make poor <br/>
choices for letterbox placements even if it were legal. <br/>

Thanks for the time and effort-  I appreciate it.  I will look at how much trouble thier required documentations takes.  It maybe just to much pain... but if it is something I can do once- and then just copy for the others then I may go ahead.<br/>
