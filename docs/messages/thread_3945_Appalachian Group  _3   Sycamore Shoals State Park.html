Sycamore Shoals State Park<br/>
Johnson City, TN    Carter County<br/>
North / South  I  81 goes thru north east TN into VA and north.<br/>
Intersection of  I 81 and I 181,  go south on I 181 thru Johnson City <br/>
 and exit at Exit 31, take highway 321 east for 4 - 5 miles to the <br/>
entrance on the park on your left.  Go to the Visitor Center area.  The <br/>
fitness walk / trail is on the right side of the building, the trail <br/>
goes between the park and a hospital next door, for about 2 miles.<br/>
Take the trail / path a short distance, Fitness area #3 is on the right. <br/>
 Stand in front of station #14 and look to your left,  a large tree that <br/>
divided into 2 trunks about 20' up and the right trunk has since fallen <br/>
off and is laying on the ground.  Behind the tree at the base / ground, <br/>
under a couple large pieces of bark, is your prize.<br/>
enjoy<br/>
