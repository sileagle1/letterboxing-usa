The page you refer to was last modified (presumably by Dr. Mings) on<br/>
Saturday, March 20, 1999 20:53:14 GMT.<br/>
<br/>
Our talk list was established in October, 1998.  Dr. Mings knows about<br/>
our list.  Those are the facts, draw your conclusions, I guess.<br/>

A few days ago, he asked to link to my homepage, so I wanted to make sure that he respected my wishes and did not have a link to my page.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I noticed on the first page (www.letterboxing.com) that it says...and I quote:<br/>

<br/>
Hmmmmmmm...what are we?  Chopped liver?  Perhaps this was written well before this eGroups discussion group was created?  I don't know.  Does anyone have any idea what the deal is with this?<br/>
