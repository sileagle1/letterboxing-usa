<br/>
After taking my third trip to the area, I was able to find the "Out of the Frying Pan" and "Into the Fire!" boxes planted by the Apple Dumpling Gang.  I was the second person to log into these boxes.<br/>
<br/>
In answer to an earlier question, no I don't think the clues are to hard - but they are certainly the hardest I've solved!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a great hunt ADG!<br/>
