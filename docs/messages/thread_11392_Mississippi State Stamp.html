Directions: From RT.44 take Cod Fish Falls RD.when you come to a stop<br/>
sign,go straight across onto Chaffeeville RD.(Follow the signs that say<br/>
grist mill.) Soon you will make a right turn onto Stone mill RD. go down<br/>
to the bottom of the hill and you will see the grist mill on the<br/>
right,keep going straight down the road and you will pass a white house<br/>
then their will be a pull off area on the left with the blue blaze trail<br/>
on the right.(Don't forget to bring the clues for Grist in the mist this<br/>
box is right down the road.) Enter the trail and keep following the blue<br/>
blazes all along the river.You will come to a intersection where the red<br/>
trail crosses over the blue but you stay true to the blue.Soon you will<br/>
come to a place where you have to cross over a little stream and go up a<br/>
banking,continue on a little more and you will see a place where the<br/>
area opens up with lots of evergreen trees.You can see this place from<br/>
where you climbed up the banking.Before you enter this clearing notice<br/>
the four oak trees growing from the same base the Mississippi LB. is in<br/>
the middle of the four.Please rehide well this is a busy trail.The<br/>
