<div>Arizona Boxes:  While in the land of great 
sunsets and wide open spaces we knew there would be time for Letterboxing.  
The boxes are emancipated but if there is a Tucson Letterboxer who could check 
on them occasionally we would appreciate it as we won't be able to visit 
them.  These boxes are located in fee areas. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>!.  Kartchner Caverns State Park, near Benson, 
Arizona,  off I 10.</div>
<div>Box placed 2/16/01,  Entrance to the park is $10.00 plus Cavern 
tickets </div>
<div>($ 14.00).  DO NOT ATTEMPT A VISIT TO THE SPECTACULAR CAVERNS WITHOUT 
TICKET RESERVATIONS.  We made reservations 2 months in advance so plan 
accordingly.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Once in the park, grab your water bottle and take the West trail of the 2 
1/2 mile Foothills Loop near the picnic area.  It is a fairly easy hike 
over a well maintained trail.  Crossing the dry Guindani Creek bed several 
times as you gain elevation, you will hike behind a hill and up to a 
saddle.  Look for trail marker 1.5/1.0.  Note:  There are 2 trail 
markers with same numbers.  You want the one that has no bench nor an 
interpretive sign called "Hidden Treasure".  From trail marker 1.5/1.0 walk 
14 paces (a 6 ft. male pace) along trail stopping in front of the second 
Mesquite tree, then 14 paces from tree at 310 degrees OR 23 paces due north from 
the trail marker sign.  Box is behind and at base of an Ocotillo under a 
small rock pile.  Watch for snakes, insects and cactus.  You should be 
able to see other hikers approaching the site so you can carefully time your 
stamping.  Continue along the trail to the other 1.5/1.0 mile marker and 
the bench awaiting you under the shade of a tree or hike back down the way you 
came up.  Notify letterbox site after you visit the box with your 
comments.     </div>
<div> </div>
<div>2  Saguaro "Summer Storms" box at Saguaro State Park (Rincon East 
District) near Tucson, Arizona; box placed 2/17/01.  Note:  There are 
2 areas of the Saguaro State Park; you want the EAST DISTRICT!  The 
box is located in a bike and child friendly area in a very accessible part of 
the park.  Drive or bike in the Park and park near the "Desert Ecology 
Trail"  and walk about 5 minutes on the paved path to the "Summer Storms" 
interpretive sign.  Leave the path and enter the wash and hike at 10 
degrees for 22 paces.  You will see a bench through the foliage on your 
right.  Continue counting paces to 100.  A tree is a 300 degrees and 
11 paces from the approximate center of the wash.  Box is at base of tree 
under rocks and wood debris on N. W. side.</div>
