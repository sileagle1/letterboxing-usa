I just wanted to clarify for you so that you don't have to do extra work:<br/>
If you're referring to the new Mt. Tammany box, it's in NJ, not in PA.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this prevents a whoops!<br/>

try a PLB and share the joy around our country.  How about sending  a PLB to <br/>

their leader.  Unfournately, I grew up in New York City during the Great <br/>
Depression  and World War II and both my parents worked and did not know anything Girl <br/>

Now some exciting news for letterboxing.  My first box that was placed at <br/>
National Cemetery will be receiving some local media attention.  The Dir. of the <br/>
National Cemetery called yesterday and told me that I have to sign a "Memo of <br/>
Responsibility" in order to have box on US Gov. owned land.  Tues or Wed the <br/>
National Cemetery will be hosting a "signing party" and have local media, my <br/>
principal, G/S Exec Dir and various other people there.  I was told by the Dir <br/>
of National Cemetery that my request went to Atlanta &amp; then on to Washington <br/>
for approval.  My MOR will go back to Washington and he also said that this <br/>
could go as far as Congress. The location of the box will not be disclosed.  I <br/>
think this is great because it will give letterboxing &amp; National Cemetery media <br/>
attention.  I hope this project will increase patriotism among our citizens.  <br/>
Patriotism has fallen to very little importance.<br/>

Will let everyone know how it goes.<br/>

Some use gravestones as checkpoints to make sure you're going in the right direction, then send us out of the cemetary to the treeline. Some graveyards (but fewer cemetaries) have little prayer/meditation gardens for visiters to use.  Of course, this requires stone walls, treelines and little gardens.  I recall some fairly stark cemetaries in Oklahoma...<br/>

  I would like to hide one at the cemetery but where do you hide it without it<br/>
  being buried.<br/>

  &gt; Now some exciting news for letterboxing.  My first box that was placed at<br/>
  &gt; National Cemetery will be receiving some local media attention.  The Dir. of<br/>
  &gt; the <br/>
  &gt; National Cemetery called yesterday and told me that I have to sign a "Memo of<br/>
  &gt; Responsibility" in order to have box on US Gov. owned land.  Tues or Wed the<br/>
  &gt; National Cemetery will be hosting a "signing party" and have local media, my<br/>
  &gt; principal, G/S Exec Dir and various other people there.  I was told by the Dir<br/>
  &gt; of National Cemetery that my request went to Atlanta &amp; then on to Washington<br/>
  &gt; for approval.  My MOR will go back to Washington and he also said that this<br/>
  &gt; could go as far as Congress. The location of the box will not be disclosed.  I<br/>
  &gt; think this is great because it will give letterboxing &amp; National Cemetery<br/>
  &gt; media <br/>
  &gt; attention.  I hope this project will increase patriotism among our citizens.<br/>
  &gt; Patriotism has fallen to very little importance.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Will let everyone know how it goes.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;        NOW I NEED SOME AVID LETTERBOXERS TO FIND MY BOX SO THAT I CAN REALLY<br/>
  &gt; SHOW EVERYONE HOW IT WORKS!!!<br/>
