Hi everyone,<br/>
Today, Kellie and I went for some boxes and to check on some <br/>
others.  We found a gorgeous stamp (one of our favorites) soaking <br/>
wet and moldy.  The logbook smelled musty and was also drenched. It <br/>
was so bad that changing bags wouldn't have cut it. The stamp <br/>
backing was so wet that the stamp had started to pull away from the <br/>
wood. The person who placed this box worked very hard on it and <br/>
would be throughly disappointed to find out about such poor <br/>
practices.  I'm not here to preach, you guys know the drill!!<br/>

Yes, please preach!!! Close the baggies properly, and snap the lid <br/>
on tightly. Don't let your 5 year old replace the letterbox, do it <br/>
yourself and make sure it is hidden.<br/>

What a shame!  This time of year is hard on boxes in general <br/>
especially on plugged boxes.  Even boxes that have been well taken <br/>
care of can get damp.  I find that boxes placed under an overhang or <br/>
off the forest floor have the best protection.  Logbooks survive <br/>
better if they have been double-bagged.<br/>
On on,<br/>

I was on a quick trip to Fl. when I found this one and I think that the hurricane's did it some damage. I'm not sure we can protect them all<br/>

Last September we found a letterbox that had survived Hurricane <br/>
Ivan.  It was in a tree and the box sealed.  However, when I opened <br/>
it up, the box itself was half full of water, the stamp baggie was <br/>
full of water, and the only thing that stayed dry was the bagged <br/>
logbook!  Everything was sealed up correctly.  Go figure.<br/>
