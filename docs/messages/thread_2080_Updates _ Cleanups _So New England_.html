All the links to my clues seem to work.  Just a general question.  As <br/>
webmaster for the So. New England section is there any particular <br/>
format or style you would prefer that we submit clues in?  Font, <br/>
background, word file, etc?  I will have three submissions shortly <br/>
(including a good mystery) and would like to make it as easy as <br/>
possible for you.<br/>

Thanks, Trish! London, huh? Sounds wonderful. To echo Susan's <br/>
previous post, we don't want to be seen as overseers or enforcers: <br/>
we're more a conduit to spread the word. Your webmasters all try very <br/>
hard not to edit (censor?) clues: we strongly believe that they are <br/>
the intellectual property of their owners.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for asking about the MS Word documents: there are a few that <br/>
get "attached" that way. I think people like to do them because they <br/>
can control the fonts and layout, and they can include images without <br/>
having to attach them separately or learn html. We webmasters have <br/>
discussed them and don't have a concrete policy, but we are starting <br/>
to see them as BIG files and we have limited disk space on the LBNA <br/>
site to include them. The LoneMassWolf just graciously allowed me to <br/>
post only the text for his Nobska Light letterbox (Woods Hole, MA) <br/>
and not use the .doc file or the images. We could just link to <br/>
the .doc files attached to email here on yahoo/egroups, but none of <br/>
us are sure how long these archives will last.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure where we'll end up on the Word files, but for now our <br/>
philosophy is not to stifle creativity by dictating terms. Submit <br/>
clues however you like, but submit them often!!!<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised at how easy putting up simple web pages is (I'm still <br/>
the least knowledgable of the webby masters). Most people with email <br/>
accounts might be surprised to find they have a little slice of free <br/>
webspace they could post their own clues to. That's always another <br/>
option.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing your new letterbox clues!<br/>

<br/>
I'm no computer expert, but I say keep it sweet and simple.  It seems<br/>
like the webmasters do an awful lot for us as it is so let's keep it<br/>
free and loose and not complicate matters for them.  After all, as far<br/>
as I know they aren't getting paid for this and they are just doing it<br/>
out of the goodness of their hearts.  Or something like that...  There<br/>
are my thoughts on the matter.<br/>
<br/>
