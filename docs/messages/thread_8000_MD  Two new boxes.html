<br/>
Been having trouble with my e-mail, so it has taken me a while to get these <br/>
out, but here are two more Maryland boxes.  Have fun.<br/>
DCDEB and KC<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Name of Box:    Side-by-Side<br/>
<br/>
Location:	Silver Spring, MD, Montgomery County<br/>
<br/>
Date Placed:	Sept.  8, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:	Clues are easy to follow.  First half of trail requires <br/>
scrambling over a few boulders. Second half of trail is flat. Not recommend <br/>
for kids under the age of five; a fall from one of the boulders ...  . Only <br/>
a 20 to 30 minute walk.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:	From I-495, take Rt 29, Colesville Road,  north for about a mile <br/>
to the Northwest Branch Park.  You can recognize the park area as the area <br/>
without a lot of development. You will come to a dip in the road where there <br/>
will be two large red brick colonial  houses ; one of the right side of <br/>
the road and one of the left.  Park in the lot behind the one on the right.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: 	       With your back to the road, enter the woods down the wooden <br/>
steps.  Follow the stream valley trail.  When you come to the place where <br/>
the boulders obscure the trail, proceed slowly keeping the large boulders on <br/>
your right. Continue to  BL, placing your right hand on BL to find your way <br/>
to the trail (do not jump off).  Continue along the trail keeping the stream <br/>
and any large boulders to your right. Continue past the large lichen spotted <br/>
boulder and over the two logs blocking the path.  When you are unsure of <br/>
your way move next to the JL Tree.  Take four steps up the rocky hill <br/>
keeping the boulder that rises two feet from the ground on your right. <br/>
Proceed down to the trail following it past the pregnant tree. Proceed to <br/>
the sandy stream bank.  Listen for  rushing water behind you and in front of <br/>
you.  At this point the trail flattens out and becomes easier to follow. <br/>
Follow the trail until you come to your first real fork in the trail.  Take <br/>
the northwest branch. When the sound of running water begins to fade look <br/>
along the path for an area of  several large dead tree logs. Find the large <br/>
log that was cut into three pieces to open up the trail. The log section you <br/>
seek is laying North to South.  Face directly North and step onto the log.  <br/>
Take 13 careful steps. The treasure you seek is just below your feet down to <br/>
the right.  When your replace the treasure make sure it is hidden from view <br/>
from both the right and the left sides of the log.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Name of Box:	Pine Cone<br/>
<br/>
Location:	Silver Spring, MD, Montgomery County<br/>
<br/>
Date Placed:	Sept. 22, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:	Clues are easy to follow.  Only a 20 to 30 minute walk.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:	Follow the same directions as for the Side-by-Side box, except <br/>
park in the lot behind the building on the left hand side of Colesville <br/>
Road.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  	With your back to the woods, walk towards Colesville Road, passing <br/>
on the right side of the brick building. Once you get to the corner of the <br/>
lot by the main road you will notice a small trail sign for the Northwest <br/>
Branch Park. Walk along the edge of Colesville Road, crossing the bridge. Be <br/>
very careful, the cars move along this stretch of road at 50 miles an hour <br/>
and the pathway you will be walking on is narrow. Hold dogs and kids <br/>
tightly. Continue walking a few more steps until you come to another next <br/>
trail sign. Enter the woods, cross the stream and follow the trail up. Once <br/>
you are at the top of the hill look ahead and towards your right to see the <br/>
dam. Continue along the trail past the dam. Continue, passing the place with <br/>
a green and white sign; a red, white and black sign; and a yellow disk. Pass <br/>
a second yellow disk. Keep following the trail  until you come to a  strange <br/>
metal structure. At this point, take the left trail fork. Continue across <br/>
the foot bridge. Follow the trail until you come to a second bridge. Just <br/>
before you cross the bridge, take the trail fork to the left. Go 25 steps <br/>
and turn left, take this small trail up the hill until you cross over the <br/>
dead log. Turn immediately left and walk two steps. Under the log is the <br/>
treasure that you seek.  When your replace the treasure make sure it is <br/>
hidden from view from both the right and the left sides of the log.<br/>

<br/>
I live right around the Colesville Road area where you have placed new <br/>
letterboxes.  I'd love to go and search for them tomorrow, but I'm having a <br/>
little trouble realizing exactly which colonial buildings you are referring <br/>
to.  Do you mean the one across the street from the strip of offices, about a <br/>
mile south of New Hampshire Avenue?<br/>
<br/>
Any help is appreciated.  Thank you.<br/>

<br/>
The place that you start from is along Colesville Rd, as you go <br/>
North on Colesville it is after Crestmoor Dr and before Lockwood <br/>
Dr.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know how the clues work out.  DCDEB<br/>
