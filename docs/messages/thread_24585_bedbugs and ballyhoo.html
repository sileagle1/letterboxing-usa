I think you mean mystery-drive by.  I don't recall planting such, but<br/>
that in no way means I didn't.  Well, "Witness: The Lost Footage" is,<br/>
of course.  So I guess I both detest and love that one.  (well, I really<br/>

<br/>
This past weekend my mom and I went boxing ALONE (ie no child or hubby) for<br/>
the day.  We did all kinds of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
The best box of the day, for me, was a drive-by.... why?  Because it was so<br/>
cool, it was hidden in a very simple place and we found it quickly but the<br/>
stamp was really interesting and the best part.... reading the log book<br/>
showed us that many many finders had missed the clues completely and had<br/>
ventured far and wide trying to find the box, and those are the ones who did<br/>
eventually find it!  For us it took 1 minute to find, for others it took 1<br/>
hour.  That was very interesting to me!<br/>
<br/>
Followed closely behind that drive-by was my second favorite of the day...<br/>
just about a drive-by, it only took about 5 minutes to find the box but the<br/>
location was SO wonderful, so tucked away, so special that it was a magical<br/>
find.  My mom said the location was delightful, and it was.  The tiniest of<br/>
tiny parks, but down a road we never would have ever gone.  The park had a<br/>
lot of history to it, it was beautifully maintained, it had a wonderful<br/>
brook meandering throught it that was so musical to log in next to.  We took<br/>
our time, no one was around to try to "hide" from, we wandered around<br/>
checking out all the flowers and rocks and trees.  It was the most peaceful<br/>
time I've had boxing in quite a while.  If I didn't "do" drive-bys I never<br/>
would have had this special experience.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing about drive-bys.... some people aren't good with clues, but<br/>
they are great carvers and great at making interesting log books.  No way<br/>
would I want to miss that because of the length of time it takes to find the<br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that what a lot of people realize when they read all the<br/>
"disagreements" is that boxing has something for everyone. Everyone comes to<br/>
the table with a different agenda and thankfully, they can all go away full<br/>
and happy.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion is that every poster (ok, maybe not EVERY one!!!) is "right".<br/>
Some are holding the elephant's tail, and some are holding his trunk.<br/>

I agree with Randy.? I prefer mystery boxes above drive-by's.? All of my plants are mystery boxes, and I've figured out most of the mystery clues in NJ (where I live) even if I might not have all the time to actually go after them.? To me a drive-by that leads you right to the box is just a waste of gas.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You've got it with the rest stop idea, but drive-bys are not limited  <br/>
to rest stops. They could be in a park, at a landmark, in town,  <br/>
anywhere. Essentially, the directions take you effortlessly to a  <br/>
parking spot where you effortlessly find the stamp:<br/>
<br/>
Go to the playground at the corner of 5th and Elm. Park in the 5th  <br/>
spot from the white post. Turn over that rock three feet in front of  <br/>
your bumper and there's the box!<br/>
<br/>
Drive-bys are hated by some, seen as necessary by others (either  <br/>
always or only in certain situations, depending on the boxer), are  <br/>
used as fixes by others when a long hike isn't possible, etc..... but  <br/>
the defining characteristic seems to be the lack of mental or  <br/>
physical effort. For me, if I had to spend a week figuring out where  <br/>
to go (if, say, Dancing Men led you to a box in a parking lot, for  <br/>
example), then it's not a drive-by, it's a mystery or a puzzle. If  <br/>
the directions were laid out step-by-step and were easy as pie to  <br/>
follow, but took me on a mile-long hike, it's not a drive-by.<br/>

Self-righteousness and proselytizing, the twin banes of civilized<br/>
discourse.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we've had, since I've returned to reading this list --<br/>
<br/>
*letterboxers vs geocachers (do they have this on geocaching fora, or<br/>
   are they more enlightened?)<br/>
*newbies vs silverbacks ("silverback" is a word I learned tonite;<br/>
   according to google:"definition silverback", it means "adult<br/>
   male gorilla with grey hairs across the back")<br/>
*store bought vs hand-carved (note the correct hyphenation)<br/>
<br/>
how about --<br/>
<br/>
mystery boxes vs drive-bys<br/>
<br/>
I'll go first.  (Note the correct hyphenation, especially since<br/>
"mystery box" is a term I coined, I can hyphenate any way I d**m<br/>
well please :-)).  I love mystery boxes, and detest drive-bys.<br/>
Who's next?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We love working on mystery boxes if Ancient &amp; I can be reasonably certain<br/>
that I've deciphered the starting point since we don't have a lot of money<br/>
and don't want to waste too much of it trying different places and finding<br/>
out I was wrong.  We're the kinda folks that often figure "OK, it didn't<br/>
work this way, then let's try that way -- nope, not that way, OK let's try<br/>
this third way."  But we don't want to spend the money right now on the gas.<br/>
Gotta save for that GPS!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
We love drive-bys in the rain.  We don't go hiking and looking for boxes in<br/>
the rain for the most part because we don't want to open the box and get<br/>
everything inside all wet and Murphy's Law says that if we find the box in<br/>
the rain, there won't be any cover close by to duck under for stamping in.<br/>
But, with a drive-by, we can grab the box, toss it into my backpack and make<br/>
off like the dickens for the van to stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, then I'm the one who always has to go back and re-hide the box in<br/>
the rain after we've stamped in.  But that's OK.  Last time Ancient did it,<br/>
before the dinosaurs were born, he slipped, started a mud slide and broke an<br/>
ankle on top of it.  And then I still had to go back there anyway and pull<br/>
him out of the mud and drag him to the van.<br/>
<br/>
So I can do it myself or figure I might have to drive him to the ER.  Do it<br/>
myself wins out.  Especially since there's no convenient time for him to<br/>
break an ankle.  He breaks an ankle in winter, means I have to shovel snow.<br/>
He breaks an ankle in springtime, means I have to rototill the garden.  He<br/>
breaks an ankle in summer, means I have to mow the lawn.  He breaks an ankle<br/>
in the fall, means I have to rake leaves.  So what's a little rain?<br/>
<br/>
Now mystery drive-bys in the rain can be romantic.   My vote's for that.<br/>
