The club also released the first in it's four-part series of hitch hikers<br/>
based around the 4 H's of 4-H. All four are stand-alone stamps, but they do<br/>
hope at least a few people come across the full set. All will be released in<br/>
the greater Los Angeles area since the members want to hand place each one.<br/>
