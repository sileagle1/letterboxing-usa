Livingston County, Mt Morris to Portageville, NY<br/>
Terrain: Moderate - Quite a few stairs, some trails can be very muddy<br/>
Clues: Easy<br/>
<br/>
Looking for a waterfall?  Here's a few...<br/>
<br/>
Letchworth State Park stretches between the towns of Mt Morris and <br/>
Portageville, with park entrances near the towns of Mt Morris, <br/>
Portageville, Castile, and Perry.  Some entrances are closed during some <br/>
seasons, so check with the park before you go; the visitor's center can be <br/>
reached at 585.493.3600.  There is an entrance fee, currently $5 per car. <br/>
 Letchworth contains 14,350 acres surrounding the Genesee River Gorge, <br/>
where the river plunges over three waterfalls, the tallest of which is 107 <br/>
feet high.  There are many activities to enjoy here, so plan on spending <br/>
some time.  The gorge is most beautiful in the fall, though also the most <br/>
crowded.  Since Letchworth is a popular destination, I tried to place this <br/>
letterbox a bit away from the main crowd, but it's not far off the trail, <br/>
so please take care that no one sees you when removing the box, and please <br/>
hide the box well when replacing it.<br/>
<br/>
Reach Letchworth State Park by taking exit 5, 6 or 7 from I-390.  The box <br/>
is near the lower falls at the south end of the park, but you can pick he <br/>
entrance most convenient to you.  Ask for a trail map at the park entrance, <br/>
the map in the brochure they hand you is not a very good one.  Follow the <br/>
main park road to the spur for the lower falls, and park in the parking lot <br/>
near campsite B and the Footbridge Nature Shop.<br/>
<br/>
Proceeding on foot, follow the signs to the trail for the lower <br/>
falls/footbridge.  Descend 127 stairs to the river's edge and follow the <br/>
path to the footbridge.  Be careful, this area may be very muddy.  Along <br/>
here, you can see a wonderful view of the lower falls, and feel the falls' <br/>
mist.  Walk across the footbridge to the east side of the river, and head <br/>
up the stairs on the other side.<br/>
<br/>
At the top of the stairs, the trail branches to the left and right, choose <br/>
the left.  You'll actually see two trails here; choose the leftmost one <br/>
that winds closest to the edge of the gorge.  Shortly, you'll see a few <br/>
chain link fences at the edge of the gorge.  At the third of these will be <br/>
a small brook that tumbles down the hill in miniature imitation of the <br/>
grand waterfalls further south - there's even a miniature footbridge. <br/>
 Follow the path as it curves upstream and cross over the brook via the <br/>
stone bridge.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after this, the path curves away from the brook, heading nearly due <br/>
south up a flight of stairs.  Stand at this spot at the base of the stairs. <br/>
 At 204 degrees, you'll see a boulder jutting from the riverbank, only six <br/>
or seven paces off the path.  Under this boulder, covered with leaves, is a <br/>
smaller rock that hides the final waterfall.<br/>
