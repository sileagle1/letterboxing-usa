Take I-5 South/North until you get near Tacoma--look for Highway 16, <br/>
take it West toward Bremerton.  Take the Cheney Stadium exit and <br/>
follow signs to Tacoma Nature Center--about 1 mile from the exit.  <br/>
The letterbox takes about 30 minutes to find!<br/>

&gt; Somewhat close to the freeway are the Thanksgiving box at Priest <br/>
Point in Olympia and the two boxes at Dash Point state park in <br/>
Federal Way ( listen on web site as "Seattle) .  There is the Lost <br/>

I have to go back for my third try.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Schmitz Park in West Seattle is fast and somewhat close to the <br/>
freeway.  Trouble with the freeways thru Seattle is that they are so <br/>
congested.  You might consider routing up 405 and stopping at Bridle <br/>
Trails SP in Kirkland.  You can bypass downtown Seattle and not <br/>
really drive any further.  Both ways equal distance and 405 likely <br/>
to be faster depending on time of day.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I suggest a very early start.<br/>

     I just placed 2 new letterboxes in DuPont, WA today (23 Jul 02) <br/>
and the trail starts less than 1/4 mile from Exit 119 on Interstate <br/>
5--if you're interested.  The first box will take about 30 minutes <br/>
and an additional 30 minutes for the second box.  <br/>
They're 'historic'...<br/>
<br/>
Have a safe trip home!<br/>

I am still learning miles though so I am not too sure how long it takes to drive a mile or 1/4 ha ha!!! See Canada switched to metric when I was in grade school so I forget most of the mile stuff.....Looks like there are a lot of options for me....we are also going to hit Amanda's and Ryan's BC boxes in North Vancouver...thanks again and hope to see you all at the OR gathering!!!!<br/><br/>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: "samanark" <samanark><br/>Date: Wed, 24 Jul 2002 09:01:19 -0000<br/>To: letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com<br/>Subject: [LbNA] Re: WA quickies??? Attn: WA Letterboxers<br/><br/><tt>From Seattle up to the Canada Border, <br/>The Larabee Park boxes Starfish and Clam are really easy.  The <br/>Washington First State Park box is a mile up the hill and Fragrance <br/>Lake adds more time too, But you could do Starfish and Clam as "drive-<br/>bys"  <br/><br/>Also the Washington Wolf Mystery Box is very easy to get off of I-<br/>5...but that is all I can say because it is a Mystery Box!!!<br/><br/><br/>And I will add my two cents that the Schmitz Park boxes are easy to <br/>get and as of 7/22 they were all alive and well!<br/><br/>--Amanda from Seattle<br/><br/><br/>PS. You could spend all day and do Priest Point in Olympia, Dash <br/>Point Park then Schmitz Park, then Ravenna and Carkeek in Seattle and <br/>then Larabee Park at the end!! that would be 11 boxes (12 if you <br/>figure out where Washington Wolf Mystery box is!!)<br/><br/>PPS. While you are across the West Seattle Bridge to get Schmitz Park <br/>(3 boxes), there are 5 more boxes in Lincoln Park and one box at Mee <br/>Kwa Mooks.  And they are all really easy easy hikes!<br/><br/>--- In letterbox-usa@y..., "Canada Goose" &lt;canadiangirl@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; <br/><br/></tt><br/><br/><tt>To unsubscribe: mailto:letterbox-usa-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br/>List info, archives, etc: <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/list.html" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.org/list.html</a><br/></tt><br/><br/><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
