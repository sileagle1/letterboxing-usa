Sorry to check in somewhat late on this (I'm not receiving all of my <br/>
Letterboxing digests...anyone else experiencing this problem?), but the 1/28 <br/>
gathering in Vernon/Storrs sounds like a terrific idea!  Count me in, too <br/>
(although I have no kids to bring with me...I hope that's okay!). As for <br/>
food, I kind of like the idea of potluck (hey, I'm a single guy, so any <br/>
opportunity to sample someone else's home cooking really appeals to me), but <br/>
I understand the potential drawbacks to this approach. In this case, then, <br/>
I'll simply go along with the will of the people. Please let me know if <br/>
there's anything in particular that I can bring.<br/>
<br/>
Carol, if it's not too much trouble, how about having some copies of several <br/>
different sets of clues for a few of the nearby letterboxes printed up? They <br/>
could be made available at the registration table for people to take with <br/>
them before heading out "into the field". Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to meeting some of my fellow letterboxers on 1/28/01, Super <br/>
Letterboxing Sunday (though, I'm not sure that we could legally call it that).<br/>

BTW, has anyone received their logo patches or decals yet?<br/>
