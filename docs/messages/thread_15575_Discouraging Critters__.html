One of the products is"Doe in heat" and that might create more problems than you currently have now. We have been successful in using old plastic peanut butter jars, primarily in the city, but have had several in semi wild areas where raccoons,squirrels and other critters hang out. After cleaning them out extremely well, I let them soak with some 409 cleaner for a week or so, then I clean them with acetone, screw the cap on tight and keep it closed until I use it. So far we haven't had a critter problem. Don<br/>
