                    <div class="plaintext-content">Spent a few sunny but chilly!! hours at Tualatin Hills Nature Park (in <br/>
Beaverton) today, seeking Thom's letterbox series.  Here's a report of our <br/>
findings:<br/>
<br/>
Boxes 2 &amp; 4 are alive &amp; well--what LOVELY stamps!<br/>
<br/>
We couldn't hunt for Boxes 1 and 8 because the Oak trail was recently <br/>
flooded, and is still closed.  The woman at the front desk expected the trail <br/>
to be open "soon," tho. <br/>
<br/>
Boxes 1, 6 &amp; 7: I'm convinced these are gone--others (Thom?) may be able to <br/>
confirm this.  <br/>
<br/>
Box 5 eluded us.  It may well be there, but we were not entirely convinced we <br/>
were looking in the correct place (with the above 3 LBs, the clues were quite <br/>
clear and we were convinced we'd found the hiding places--but alas, no boxes).<br/>
<br/>
Box 3--oops, we neglected to look for this one.  Will have to try again when <br/>
we go back for 1 &amp; 8.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any recent knowledge of these boxes?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Back in November, over the Thanksgiving Holiday, the Nail Family was <br/>
successful in finding box #2 and 4 also.  However, we agree that box <br/>
1,3, and 5 are missing. We got quite lost trying to find the location <br/>
of #5, since we found the trail we assume was the one mentioned but <br/>
no log among the nettles. After searching for box #5 for about 1/2 <br/>
hour and after not-so-Happy Mom and Nailhead got in an argument about <br/>
paces vs steps, we gave up and went to an exclusive screening of a  <br/>
movie(mystery).  By the way, the location of box #3 that we assume <br/>
was missing was really cool!  I hope that the box gets replaced, it <br/>
is a very unique and unmistakable hiding spot.<br/>

daylight and gave up on the rest of the series for a while as we <br/>

the future.  We did see some interesting animals during our visit, <br/>
however--which made the whole trip worthwhile!<br/>

Boxes 6 &amp; 7 are definitely gone.  Don't know about #1, though.<br/>

Last time I looked (over a year ago), it was still there, but it IS a <br/>
tricky box to find and many boxers before you have failed at finding <br/>
it!  =)<br/>

aunties today, and left me behind to catch up on work.  (Boo hoo.)  They <br/>
report the following, alive and well:<br/>
<br/>
Little People<br/>
Hyland Park<br/>
Fanno Creek--they report that it apparently endured high water and the <br/>
notebook was quite damp.  They replaced the wet plastic bag with a dry one.  <br/>
(This LB had thwarted me earlier this year; I'd e-mailed that I thought it <br/>
might be missing.  Ryan said to reach far in after it; he was right.)<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we also found:<br/>
Tryon Creek Orphan<br/>
Tryon Creek LB #1  (ran out of steam before we got to the remaining three--we <br/>
shall return!!!)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Deciding that we just hadn't had enough rainy weather, my family chose to <br/>
spend the past four days at the Oregon coast.  While dodging raindrops, we <br/>
managed to find the following:<br/>
<br/>
Bombs Away (found 3/20): avoiding obvious comments that could be made, I'll <br/>
instead say that the box had had just one visiting group before <br/>
us--geocachers who had stumbled upon it.  <br/>
<br/>
Coquille River Lighthouse (found 3/21): Alive &amp; well &amp; with a lovely stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Haceta Head (found 3/22): Jessica and Barry had stamped in ahead of us on <br/>
this day--we were there in mid- or late morning--couldn't have missed them by <br/>
much! <br/>
<br/>
Beneath the Blue #2 (found 3/22): I left family members cavorting on the <br/>
beach to chase this one down.  Had to wade thru water covering the trail in <br/>
several spots--but such a nice little stamp, and--wonderful bonus when I <br/>
lifted the mossy branch--a lovely little light-orange salamander guarding the <br/>
box (an ensatina? a western red-backed salamander?  I don't know, but I was <br/>
very happy to make its acquaintance.)<br/>
<br/>
Devil's Lake State Park (found 3/23): Oh my, this box was apparently caught <br/>
up in a flood.  It was out of its hiding spot &amp; utterly soaked.  We dried out <br/>
the box, replaced the soggy baggies, and also added a new notebook.  We left <br/>
the old notebook in a new baggie, but I'm afraid there's not much hope for it.<br/>
<br/>
Van Duzer Corridor (found 3/23): Alive and well, tho also a little dampish.  <br/>
Dried it out &amp; replaced bags and it's good as new.<br/>
<br/>
45th Parallel--Mill Creek (found 3/23): Also alive and well; great location.  <br/>
<br/>
I also attempted to find the Mike Miller State Park box, but the "small, <br/>
dried up creek" is now a standing pool of water and, if I've interpreted the <br/>
clues correctly, the box is completely underwater.<br/>
<br/>
We also dropped three new LBs.  I'll e-mail the clues as soon as I write them <br/>
out.<br/>

<br/>
I'd just like to point out in my defense, I hid that box long before <br/>
the Iraq thing became an issue!  Rather, the box is hidden at the <br/>
site of where a WWII Japanese bomb was dropped in Oregon, thus giving <br/>
it its name.  I'd certainly think twice before naming a box 'Bombs <br/>
Away' today!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the updates on my boxes!<br/>
