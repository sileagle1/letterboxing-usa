by every mosquito in the county. The harvest moon and the gorgeous <br/>
scenery inspired Sarah to carve, carve, carve. Altogether we placed <br/>
two boxes in the county and the hitcher is in one of them. Enjoy! <br/>
<br/>
The hitchhiker is called "Tammy's Tribute" and it is dedicated to St. <br/>
Mary's College and all of the fabulous people I worked and played <br/>
with while I was a theater major.   <br/>

Harvest Moon <br/>
Point Lookout State Park <br/>
Scotland, Maryland in St. Mary's County <br/>

Point Lookout is a stunning park where you can fish, swim, or just <br/>
enjoy the scenery. It is located on a small peninsula where the St. <br/>
Mary's River, the Potomac River, and the Chesapeake Bay all converge. <br/>
This area was a hotbed during the Civil War and was the site of a <br/>
prison camp as well as Fort Lincoln. The lighthouse at the end of the <br/>
point and the area surrounding the fort are supposed to be heavily <br/>
haunted. If you decide to go around Halloween, be sure to stay for <br/>
the Haunted Tour. Depending on the time and the day, you may have to <br/>
pay $3.00 to get into this lovely area. This is a very short and easy <br/>
hike on a carpet of pine-needles. If you are quiet, you may stumble <br/>
upon some deer. We saw quite a few fauns in the area during our <br/>
visit. <br/>
