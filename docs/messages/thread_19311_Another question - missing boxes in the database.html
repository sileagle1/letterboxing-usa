For our trip to Philly this weekend, we thought we might find out if <br/>
any letterboxes were possible.  One in town, the Eastern State <br/>
Peniteniary box seemed easy enough as we're hoping to visit the <br/>
Peniteniary while we're there.<br/>
<br/>
The Box was hidden on July 16, 2001 according to the clue which is <br/>
linked to from the LbNA database.<br/>
<br/>
I posted about it on the LbMA board.  Someone came back to say it had <br/>
been missing for over a year.<br/>
<br/>
Good information, of course.  The clue sheet hadn't been updated.  <br/>
Seems to me that if it was, in fact, confirmed missing, someone <br/>
should state so in the clue so people don't go blindly hunting for <br/>
something that isn't there.  Is that standard protocol?<br/>
<br/>
That led me to another thought/question -- is there any protocol to <br/>
remove confirmed missing boxes from the database?  I think if not, <br/>
the database could be easily filled with a bunch of phantom boxes in <br/>
a few years ... certainly harming the interest in this hobby.<br/>
<br/>
A search for this topic on these boards was unsuccessful.  Shall we <br/>
discuss now?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would have to agree with you to some extent.  There's nothing more <br/>
frustrating than printing off clues and then finding out, after you've gone and tried <br/>
to find the box, that it had been confirmed missing.  I feel as though the <br/>
owners of boxes should  say whether the box is reported or confirmed missing.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if you understand the difference, so here goes: if a box is <br/>
reported missing, and the box planter has not (or can not) go out and see if it is <br/>
still in place, then I feel as though the box planter should write on the <br/>
clues that it is "reported but not confirmed missing".  That way, it is up to the <br/>
finder whether they want to go out and look for it.  If a box is confirmed <br/>
missing by the planter, then I feel as though the box planter should write on <br/>
the clues that the box is confirmed missing.  That way, no one will go out to <br/>
look for the box because it is confirmed.<br/>
<br/>
I have a few boxes that are reported but not confirmed missing.  One of the <br/>
boxes is in VA and I will not be going out there anytime soon to check on it.  <br/>
THe other is here in CT, but I'm in grad school right now (an action research <br/>
class none the less!) and have NO time to drive an hour and 15 minutes to <br/>
check on one box.  I have however changed the clues to state that they are <br/>
reported but not confirmed missing.<br/>
<br/>
I feel as though it is the planter's responsibility to update the clues when <br/>
notified.  If a planter is no longer active, then I feel as though the box <br/>
should be adopted by someone who knows where the box is and can confirm whether <br/>
it is missing.<br/>
<br/>
I feel for ya!  Happy Hunting, whatever you decide!<br/>
<br/>
just my 1 1/2 cents (that's all I can afford after paying almost $3000 for <br/>
summer grad courses!)....<br/>

I agree that the database should be updated to remove the missing boxes.  I notified one planter that her box was missing but did not get a reply back.  I can understand not removing it immediately but after confirmation by the planter hat is is indeed gone, it should be noted in the database and then removed after a specified time period.  And thanks for the headsup on the Philly Easy. Pen. box- we are going to Philly in a few weeks and that was on our list.<br/>

They listed that it's missing on their website, if that helps...<br/>

I only live 10 minutes away from it, so it wasn't such a <br/>

<br/>
The page the LbNA database links to is below:<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/martianmaggot_K9/east_state.html<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't say "missing" anywhere there.  Ah, I see, if you change the <br/>
URL to go to the main website, it's listed there.  Well, see the LbNA <br/>
database doesn't link to that, and there is no link on the clue page <br/>
itself (nor does the clue page say missing).<br/>
<br/>
But, anyway, the question was more about removing missing boxes from <br/>
the database than figuring out the story with this particular box.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the additional info., though.<br/>

&gt; been missing for over a year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

<br/>
Not necessarily, we have recieved numerous reports that a specific <br/>
letterbox is missing, but when we go to verify it's condition we <br/>
find it in place. While we checked and rechecked our clues, it seems <br/>
as though those looking for the letterbox are not reading the clues <br/>
completely. We generally post the info on the clue sheet in any case <br/>
and have had folks find that letterbox right after someone else has <br/>
informed us that it was missing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &gt; <br/>
&gt; That led me to another thought/question -- is there any protocol <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; remove confirmed missing boxes from the database?  I think if not, <br/>
&gt; the database could be easily filled with a bunch of phantom boxes <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; a few years ... certainly harming the interest in this hobby.<br/>
<br/>
That might be rather presumptuous for the above reason. Again we <br/>
have one letterbox in a series that has rather obscure clues that is <br/>
only found by one in five letterboxers. What if the next 20 can't <br/>
locate it? Not finding letterboxes is part of the hobby. This could <br/>
be from placer error or finder error. There are some letterboxes <br/>
that may require multiple attempts, but when you are finally <br/>
successful how sweet it is.<br/>

One person in my area who has planted over a dozen letterboxes has <br/>

I would have to agree with Don.  I have frequent reports about boxes <br/>
being missing, only to hear later from an individual who found it, <br/>
or check on it to find it is still securely in its hiding spot.  <br/>
<br/>
There have been a few times in looking for a box, I search and <br/>
search and even rewalk the clues to come up empty-handed.  On <br/>
another day, the clues untwist differently and I find the box, <br/>
realizing I was in the completely wrong spot, or didn't go quite far <br/>
enough up the trail or thought "that" was the three-foot stump the <br/>
clues referred to...<br/>
<br/>
I generally do not make notations about missing boxes on my clues <br/>
unless either I or somebody who has previously found the box (i.e. <br/>
knows for sure where the spot is), has confirmed it is not there.  <br/>
Even then, I have had a couple surface, one having been rehid in the <br/>
wrong spot a few feet up the trail, and the other being found <br/>
(hidden) in a completely different part of the park.  If I am unable <br/>
to check a box after receiving a few "missing" reports, I may make a <br/>
note about the uncertainty of the box, but would not remove it or <br/>
note that it is "missing."<br/>
<br/>
As Don said -- missing boxes are part of the game, just as with most <br/>
sports -- you aren't always going to win, but hopefully you will <br/>
still have enjoyed playing.  You can always e-mail the place prior <br/>
to looking for a box to verify its status if having the prize <br/>
waiting at the end of the trail is the prime concern.  If they are <br/>
uncertain as to the status or don't respond, look for a different <br/>
box.<br/>

Spring Chick beat me to it...  The question is are you doing this for the excitement of the hunt or the thrill of victory?<br/>
<br/>
If you are doing it for the thrill of victory, stick with straightforward clues hidden in remote areas as those will have the best chance of being left undisturbed and are easiest to find.<br/>
<br/>
If for the excitement of the hunt, go for a box that has some uncertainty.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is a diverse hobby that can appeal to all levels and types of players.  I realize that hobbies evolve over time but let's not stunt the hobby of letterboxing by throttling it with limitations.<br/>

I have found boxes that have been gone for months<br/>
before.If they took off all the boxes that people said<br/>
were missing (because they couldn't find them) there<br/>
wouldn't be any boxes left. I looked for the Rhode<br/>
Island Coin Letterbox 8 times. I thought it was<br/>
missing. The person that put it out there said it was<br/>
right where he left it. I WAS READING THE CLUES WRONG.<br/>
So be careful before you say a box is missing.<br/>
Sometimes we can't see the forest for the trees. It is<br/>
not about the getting the letterbox it is about the<br/>
adventure.<br/>

I'd be disappointed to start a quest with a specific goal (the <br/>
letterbox), not find it, and then learn that it was never there in <br/>
the first place.  I presume that most times not being able to find a <br/>
letterbox relates to misreading the clues or some other hunter error.<br/>
<br/>
It hasn't happened yet, but could you imagine if 9 times out of 10 <br/>
you searched for boxes you couldn't find them?  My guess is that it <br/>
would discourage you from continuing in this hobby.  That's all I'm <br/>
saying.  If a box is reported as missing, the placer should (within a <br/>
reasonable period of time, of course) attempt to confirm that.  If it <br/>
is, in fact, missing, replace it or remove the clues.  The more <br/>
people that report it as missing, the more priority the placer should <br/>
have to confirming whether the box still exists or not.<br/>
<br/>
If a placer cannot confirm because they live too far away, don't have <br/>
time, or aren't in the hobby anymore, then a "caretaker" or adoptive <br/>
owner should take a look.  That's all.  I firmly feel that if the <br/>
database starts filling up with ghost boxes -- boxes that used to be <br/>
there but aren't anymore -- as either reported by lots of independent <br/>
letterboxers or by the placer themselves, then what value is the <br/>
database?  Using Eastern State Peniteniary as an example, the placer <br/>
stated the box might be missing 11 months ago, but no confirmation or <br/>
update has been received since.  That notice, by the way, was not <br/>
part of the page that the database links to.  If 5 years passes and <br/>
that box is still listed and is still "presumed missing" as of <br/>
8/1/2003, then all it's done is direct a bunch of letterboxers to <br/>
nothing.  They may have fun touring the Peniteniary but it sure will <br/>
be frustrating if 200 people hunt for a box that isn't there.<br/>
<br/>
I am NOT saying remove clues for boxes that are MIA but not confirmed <br/>
missing.  Repeat -- I am NOT saying remove clues for boxes that <br/>
someone couldn't find simply because they couldn't find it.  I am <br/>
saying that clues be removed for boxes the placer confirms is no <br/>
longer there or, in the event that the placer never responds over a <br/>
long period of time (like a year) have a system in place to mark the <br/>
box so that other hunters are aware that the liklihood of it not <br/>
being there is known.<br/>
<br/>
Take this fictitous example:<br/>
<br/>
I place the "Nobody Home" box.  Some non-letterboxer discovers it and <br/>
steals it.  A letterboxer searches for it but can't find it.  They e-<br/>
mail me, but I've stopped letterboxing, so I don't respond.  Four <br/>
more letterboxers can't find it ('cause it isn't there).  They e-mail <br/>
me, but I don't respond.  The clues remain in the LbNA database. Is <br/>
this a problem?<br/>
<br/>
Situation two.  Same as above, except I confirm that the box is, in <br/>
fact, missing.  The clues, however, remain in the LbNA database.  Is <br/>
this a problem?<br/>
<br/>
That's all I'm asking you to consider.  I seek only to offer ideas, <br/>
conversation, and recommendations to enhance this hobby, not detract <br/>
from it.  Your opinions are respected.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentially, although I'm new to this hobby, I have found every box <br/>
I've searched for so far.<br/>
<br/>

I would not advise coming up to Maine anytime to box soon. Though some boxes are easy <br/>
to find, there are many that I have hunted for at least 5-10 times and come up empty <br/>
handed. Most times it is a clear case of not enough coffee, sleep or food. When I am <br/>
relaxed and thinking about just my surroundings, and not too much about the clue - then <br/>
it hits me like a bolt of lightning - and then you have the "Eureka moment" that many have <br/>
written about. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it is a simple as sight-recognition. It isn't that you're stupid or that the clue is <br/>
too difficult, just that certain people who place letterboxes have certain styles. once you've <br/>
done some of those more challenging boxes, then you can pretty much consider yourself <br/>
ready for anything!!<br/>

If a placer cannot confirm because they live too far away, don't have <br/>
time, or aren't in the hobby anymore, then a "caretaker" or adoptive <br/>
owner should take a look.  That's all.  I firmly feel that if the <br/>
database starts filling up with ghost boxes -- boxes that used to be <br/>
there but aren't anymore -- as either reported by lots of independent <br/>
letterboxers or by the placer themselves, then what value is the <br/>
database?  Using Eastern State Peniteniary as an example, the placer <br/>
stated the box might be missing 11 months ago, but no confirmation or <br/>
update has been received since.  That notice, by the way, was not <br/>
part of the page that the database links to.  If 5 years passes and <br/>
that box is still listed and is still "presumed missing" as of <br/>
8/1/2003, then all it's done is direct a bunch of letterboxers to <br/>
nothing.  They may have fun touring the Peniteniary but it sure will <br/>
be frustrating if 200 people hunt for a box that isn't there.<br/>
<br/>
I am NOT saying remove clues for boxes that are MIA but not confirmed <br/>
missing.  Repeat -- I am NOT saying remove clues for boxes that <br/>
someone couldn't find simply because they couldn't find it.  I am <br/>
saying that clues be removed for boxes the placer confirms is no <br/>
longer there or, in the event that the placer never responds over a <br/>
long period of time (like a year) have a system in place to mark the <br/>
box so that other hunters are aware that the liklihood of it not <br/>
being there is known.<br/>
<br/>
Take this fictitous example:<br/>
<br/>
I place the "Nobody Home" box.  Some non-letterboxer discovers it and <br/>
steals it.  A letterboxer searches for it but can't find it.  They e-<br/>
mail me, but I've stopped letterboxing, so I don't respond.  Four <br/>
more letterboxers can't find it ('cause it isn't there).  They e-mail <br/>
me, but I don't respond.  The clues remain in the LbNA database. Is <br/>
this a problem?<br/>
<br/>
Situation two.  Same as above, except I confirm that the box is, in <br/>
fact, missing.  The clues, however, remain in the LbNA database.  Is <br/>
this a problem?<br/>
<br/>
That's all I'm asking you to consider.  I seek only to offer ideas, <br/>
conversation, and recommendations to enhance this hobby, not detract <br/>
from it.  Your opinions are respected.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentially, although I'm new to this hobby, I have found every box <br/>
I've searched for so far.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; As Don said -- missing boxes are part of the game, just as with <br/>
most<br/>
&gt; &gt; sports -- you aren't always going to win, but hopefully you will <br/>
&gt; &gt; still have enjoyed playing.  You can always e-mail the place prior<br/>
&gt; &gt; to looking for a box to verify its status if having the prize<br/>
&gt; &gt; waiting at the end of the trail is the prime concern.  If they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; uncertain as to the status or don't respond, look for a different<br/>
&gt; &gt; box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Spring Chick beat me to it...  The question is are you doing this <br/>
for the excitement of the hunt or the thrill of victory?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are doing it for the thrill of victory, stick with <br/>
straightforward clues hidden in remote areas as those will have the <br/>
best chance of being left undisturbed and are easiest to find.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If for the excitement of the hunt, go for a box that has some <br/>
uncertainty.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Letterboxing is a diverse hobby that can appeal to all levels and <br/>
types of players.  I realize that hobbies evolve over time but let's <br/>
not stunt the hobby of letterboxing by throttling it with limitations.<br/>

Looks like we are doing a good job of policing the lost boxes then. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I, for one, update the clues for a page any time I get a confirmed finding.  That way, for those who are worried about wasting time on a possibly missing box, they can see that it has been found and how long ago it was found.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the frustration of looking for a box that may be gone and not finding it, albeit vicariously through my wife.  She has little patience for spending a long time looking for a box and is very frustrated if she can't find it.  I tend to do most of letterboxing alone for that reason. ;)<br/>

  But to return to the topic - The database was revamped so that the placer can now take charge of editting his/her own box clues themselves.  I understand it used to be otherwise.  We've recently entered a time where placers have more responsibility, and we'll see how we do.  Could be good, could be not so good, but so far it seems  better.<br/>

  Subject: [LbNA] Re: Another question - missing boxes in the database<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Hey, I'm all for the adventure, but perhaps different from others, <br/>
  I'd be disappointed to start a quest with a specific goal (the <br/>
  letterbox), not find it, and then learn that it was never there in <br/>
  the first place.  I presume that most times not being able to find a <br/>
  letterbox relates to misreading the clues or some other hunter error.<br/>
<br/>
  It hasn't happened yet, but could you imagine if 9 times out of 10 <br/>
  you searched for boxes you couldn't find them?  My guess is that it <br/>
  would discourage you from continuing in this hobby.  That's all I'm <br/>
  saying.  If a box is reported as missing, the placer should (within a <br/>
  reasonable period of time, of course) attempt to confirm that.  If it <br/>
  is, in fact, missing, replace it or remove the clues.  The more <br/>
  people that report it as missing, the more priority the placer should <br/>
  have to confirming whether the box still exists or not.<br/>
<br/>
  If a placer cannot confirm because they live too far away, don't have <br/>
  time, or aren't in the hobby anymore, then a "caretaker" or adoptive <br/>
  owner should take a look.  That's all.  I firmly feel that if the <br/>
  database starts filling up with ghost boxes -- boxes that used to be <br/>
  there but aren't anymore -- as either reported by lots of independent <br/>
  letterboxers or by the placer themselves, then what value is the <br/>
  database?  Using Eastern State Peniteniary as an example, the placer <br/>
  stated the box might be missing 11 months ago, but no confirmation or <br/>
  update has been received since.  That notice, by the way, was not <br/>
  part of the page that the database links to.  If 5 years passes and <br/>
  that box is still listed and is still "presumed missing" as of <br/>
  8/1/2003, then all it's done is direct a bunch of letterboxers to <br/>
  nothing.  They may have fun touring the Peniteniary but it sure will <br/>
  be frustrating if 200 people hunt for a box that isn't there.<br/>
<br/>
  I am NOT saying remove clues for boxes that are MIA but not confirmed <br/>
  missing.  Repeat -- I am NOT saying remove clues for boxes that <br/>
  someone couldn't find simply because they couldn't find it.  I am <br/>
  saying that clues be removed for boxes the placer confirms is no <br/>
  longer there or, in the event that the placer never responds over a <br/>
  long period of time (like a year) have a system in place to mark the <br/>
  box so that other hunters are aware that the liklihood of it not <br/>
  being there is known.<br/>
<br/>
  Take this fictitous example:<br/>
<br/>
  I place the "Nobody Home" box.  Some non-letterboxer discovers it and <br/>
  steals it.  A letterboxer searches for it but can't find it.  They e-<br/>
  mail me, but I've stopped letterboxing, so I don't respond.  Four <br/>
  more letterboxers can't find it ('cause it isn't there).  They e-mail <br/>
  me, but I don't respond.  The clues remain in the LbNA database. Is <br/>
  this a problem?<br/>
<br/>
  Situation two.  Same as above, except I confirm that the box is, in <br/>
  fact, missing.  The clues, however, remain in the LbNA database.  Is <br/>
  this a problem?<br/>
<br/>
  That's all I'm asking you to consider.  I seek only to offer ideas, <br/>
  conversation, and recommendations to enhance this hobby, not detract <br/>
  from it.  Your opinions are respected.<br/>
<br/>
  Incidentially, although I'm new to this hobby, I have found every box <br/>
  I've searched for so far.<br/>
<br/>

  &gt; &gt; As Don said -- missing boxes are part of the game, just as with <br/>
  most<br/>
  &gt; &gt; sports -- you aren't always going to win, but hopefully you will <br/>
  &gt; &gt; still have enjoyed playing.  You can always e-mail the place prior<br/>
  &gt; &gt; to looking for a box to verify its status if having the prize<br/>
  &gt; &gt; waiting at the end of the trail is the prime concern.  If they are<br/>
  &gt; &gt; uncertain as to the status or don't respond, look for a different<br/>
  &gt; &gt; box.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Spring Chick beat me to it...  The question is are you doing this <br/>
  for the excitement of the hunt or the thrill of victory?<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; If you are doing it for the thrill of victory, stick with <br/>
  straightforward clues hidden in remote areas as those will have the <br/>
  best chance of being left undisturbed and are easiest to find.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; If for the excitement of the hunt, go for a box that has some <br/>
  uncertainty.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Letterboxing is a diverse hobby that can appeal to all levels and <br/>
  types of players.  I realize that hobbies evolve over time but let's <br/>
  not stunt the hobby of letterboxing by throttling it with limitations.<br/>

  &gt; I'd be disappointed to start a quest with a specific goal (the <br/>
  &gt; letterbox), not find it, and then learn that it was never there in <br/>
  &gt; the first place.  I presume that most times not being able to find a <br/>
  &gt; letterbox relates to misreading the clues or some other hunter error.<br/>
<br/>
  I would not advise coming up to Maine anytime to box soon. Though some boxes are easy <br/>
  to find, there are many that I have hunted for at least 5-10 times and come up empty <br/>
  handed. Most times it is a clear case of not enough coffee, sleep or food. When I am <br/>
  relaxed and thinking about just my surroundings, and not too much about the clue - then <br/>
  it hits me like a bolt of lightning - and then you have the "Eureka moment" that many have <br/>
  written about. <br/>
<br/>
  Sometimes it is a simple as sight-recognition. It isn't that you're stupid or that the clue is <br/>
  too difficult, just that certain people who place letterboxes have certain styles. once you've <br/>
  done some of those more challenging boxes, then you can pretty much consider yourself <br/>
  ready for anything!!<br/>

Plus, we hope to have our "Sailin' shoe" hitchhiker done by then, which is a tribute to another favorite band - Little Feat. And we should have 2 more boxes done to plant near the gathering site. So, we're working hard. Carmen may not hike, but he is a hell of a carver. He and his girlfriend may stop in at the gathering. I hope so because his personal stamp is really cool and no one ever gets to see it because he doesn't hunt with me.<br/>

It's really an issue of courtesy in my opinion.  If you know your <br/>

&gt; different, and we all do this for different reasons. Sometimes it <br/>
IS <br/>
&gt; the hunt, sometimes the find... depends on how I feel for the day <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; what I want/need to accomplish, both mentally and physically.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A database to help keep track of a box's status becomes more and <br/>
more <br/>
&gt; necessary as time goes on and more and more people drop out and <br/>
&gt; disappear. <br/>
&gt; We must value our diversity. Thanks for giving me a forum to voice <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; feelings and opinions:)  K*<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey, I'm all for the adventure, but perhaps different from <br/>
others, <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'd be disappointed to start a quest with a specific goal (the <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterbox), not find it, and then learn that it was never there <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; &gt; the first place.  I presume that most times not being able to <br/>
find  <br/>
&gt; will <br/>
&gt; &gt; be frustrating if 200 people hunt for a box that isn't there.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I am NOT saying remove clues for boxes that are MIA but not <br/>
&gt; confirmed <br/>
&gt; &gt; missing.  Repeat -- I am NOT saying remove clues for boxes that <br/>
&gt; &gt; someone couldn't find simply because they couldn't find it.  I <br/>
am <br/>
&gt; &gt; saying that clues be removed for boxes the placer confirms is no <br/>
&gt; &gt; longer there or, in the event that the placer never responds <br/>
over a <br/>
&gt; &gt; long period of time (like a year) have a system in place to mark <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; box so that other hunters are aware that the liklihood of it not <br/>
&gt; &gt; being there is known.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Take this fictitous example:.  A letterboxer searches for it but <br/>
&gt; can't find it.  They e-<br/>
&gt; &gt; mail me, but I've stopped letterboxing, so I don't respond.  <br/>
Four <br/>
&gt; &gt; more letterboxers can't find it ('cause it isn't there).  They e-<br/>
&gt; mail <br/>
&gt; &gt; me, but I don't respond.  The clues remain in the LbNA database. <br/>
Is <br/>
&gt; &gt; this a problem?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Situation two.  Same as above, except I confirm that the box is, <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; &gt; fact, missing.  The clues, however, remain in the LbNA <br/>
database.  <br/>

&gt; I am in it for the HUNT (&amp; the exercise!)- my 6-year old is in it <br/>

&gt; unsuccessful journeys &amp; she may lose interest (&amp; I will get <br/>

Not finding a letterbox is just part of the game. If the find is all <br/>
that attracts her to the hobby then look for the easy drivebys. Not <br/>
being successful at every endeavor allows the real successes to be <br/>
even more sweeter, and the difficult letterboxes are set up to be <br/>
just that--difficult and sweeter. You probably wouldn't take your 6 <br/>
year old on a 5 to 10 mile hike, so you modify your searches in that <br/>
area so why not concentrate on easier finds. Why not plant one for <br/>
her?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's really an issue of courtesy in my opinion.  If you know your <br/>
&gt; box is unavailable or if you realize that you've simply lost <br/>
&gt; interest in the game- just post a note saying that you're done, <br/>
here <br/>
&gt; are your boxes if anyone wants to maintain them &amp; if not, go after <br/>
&gt; them at your own risk.<br/>
<br/>
Courtesy can be a hard thing to find with some letterboxers. Most <br/>
active letterboxers keep their clue sheets up to date, but if they <br/>
are no longer planting letterboxes then they obviously have lost <br/>
interest. I would suggest that if you want to research clues, then <br/>
go to the list of Planters on the Search for boxes page after you <br/>
have found a few clue sheets and look up the name of the planter. If <br/>
they have many listed then it would be a good guess that the clues <br/>
to their boxes are good. Another alternative would be to use the <br/>
Contact the Placer function and if you do not get an answer then <br/>
pass on that letterbox. While there are data bases that list <br/>
attempts by finders and record various information about <br/>
letterboxes, most Planters really dislike them as they may not allow <br/>
input from the planter of the letterbox. You can not get really up <br/>
to date info on a letterbox from such sources as many times a <br/>
letterbox is pulled or a name is changed when unauthorised info is <br/>
found in such data bases. I believe that the Contact the Placer <br/>
function will be you only reliable tool to verify the status of a <br/>
letterbox. <br/>

keep our hikes within the 2 mile roundtrip range &amp; if the clue <br/>
doesn't say how long it is I either contact the placer or don't go.  <br/>
I know my kids' limits.  And when we're unsuccessful we try to make <br/>
sure that our next one is at a box that has been recently found so <br/>
our chances are better.  Last weekend for example we were 0 for 2 in <br/>
the morning- 1 because I just got it wrong &amp; 1 box was missing I <br/>
believe- so in the afternoon we found a tasty box at an ice cream <br/>
place.  That more than made up for the morning's disappointment!  I <br/>
also tend to contact the placer if the box was placed more than a <br/>
year ago to make sure that it's still in place.  <br/>
<br/>
I actually haven't found the secondary databases very handy because <br/>
I'd prefer to get the info straight from the placer when possible- <br/>
for precisely the reasons you point out.  And, the box we planted <br/>
was VERY easy- a drive up.  Future boxes will also probably be easy <br/>
for the kids' sake &amp; mine for maintenance.  They want to help me <br/>
maintain them &amp; that will only happen if we can get to them without <br/>
too much ado (&amp; it will be good for other families to have <br/>
some "easy" boxes).  <br/>

One way or another these things always seem to work themselves <br/>
out! :)<br/>
