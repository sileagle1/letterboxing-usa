Does anybody know of the status of the boxes in the Raleigh/Durham area in <br/>
North Carolina?  We will be there next week and wanted to take our cub scout <br/>
nephew on a hunt for letterboxes.  I hate to take him if the boxes are gone.  <br/>
There are two on the Duke University campus we were going to try to find and one <br/>
in a park in Cary.  There are also a couple in Raleigh, Lake Johnson and <br/>
Squirrel Nutkin, we may have time to look for.<br/>
<br/>
Can anybody give me any info on these boxes?<br/>

Thank you so much for responding to my queries.  I have received emails from <br/>
the person who placed the Lake Johnson and Hemlock boxes.  Hemlock was removed <br/>
by the Park Rangers, but Lake Johnson should still be there (the box, in <br/>
addition to the actual lake).   We will be in Durham one afternoon, so will look <br/>
for the Rogue Tarheel box and maybe the other one, too.  <br/>
<br/>
I am really looking forward to our searches!<br/>
