 I have replaces the #2 box at Scotts Cove and have posted the new clues. The <br/>
new box is in the immediate area of the old box but due to the popularity of <br/>
this area for courting couples I did not think that putting it in the same <br/>
hiding place was a good idea.  I hope the new spot will be less likely to be <br/>
seen if it is not rehidden carefully.  Lately I have seen several boxes left <br/>
uncovered.<br/>
