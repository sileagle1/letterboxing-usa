The Taylor Park Dogwalker Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Location:   State: Florida       County: Pinellas          Town: Largo<br/>
		 John S. Taylor Park   ( a Pinellas County Park )<br/>
<br/>
Planted by: Tweety and Mr. Coon   1/09/03<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Easy. (unless you want to do the exercise stations) Flat <br/>
loop path of about a mile and a half or so around a pond. You can <br/>
park within a couple of hundred yards of the box.<br/>
<br/>
Driving directions:  On 8th Street ( Taylor Road ) between US Rte. 19 <br/>
and Florida 697 or access the park as we do from the Fred Marquis <br/>
Pinellas Trail at the trailside granite marker (mile 15) dedicating <br/>
the trail to Mr. Marquis. <br/>
<br/>
Background:<br/>
Riding on this paved trail which extends from St. Petersburg to <br/>
Tarpon Springs (34 miles or so) has become a must activity for us <br/>
when we visit anywhere near the area.  We wanted to plant a box along <br/>
the trail itself, but they keep it so well groomed that hiding spots <br/>
are hard to find. These county parks are really nice though and since <br/>
a number of them abut the trail we settled for that. <br/>
<br/>
Directions to the box:  <br/>
	Entering the park from the Pinellas Trail head towards the <br/>
water and intercept the gravel path which encircles the pond.<br/>
There's <br/>
a parking lot, playground, and restrooms here if you arrive by car <br/>
and want to take the walk. There's parking, picnic tables, and <br/>
restrooms across the pond nearer the box location too. Follow the <br/>
path around the pond and find Vita Course Station #14. Stand in front <br/>
of the station sign facing the path and sight past a pine tree at <br/>
about 280 degrees to a large 5 trunked live oak tree. Take about 33 <br/>
of my steps toward the live oak and look between the base of the <br/>
north side of the tree and a small (about ten inches high) stump for <br/>
the box. Keep a weather eye out for gators. Enjoy the park and the <br/>
trail. <br/>
