                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I didn't use the "Mike Tyson" approach to my last post.I should <br/>
have reread my post and made it a little more civil. Being falsely <br/>
accused is difficult to take.<br/>
Since then I have settled down and realized that many of you are <br/>
neophytes at solving crimes(other than Mr. Bacon) and tend to jump to <br/>
conclusions. My introspection also made me reconsider some of the <br/>
possibilities that I might have seen on our way northbound from San <br/>
Diego. I recall a vehicle heading south by what appeared to be <br/>
Stealthboxxer behind the wheel. This vehicle was driving pretty fast <br/>
and had  what looked like a back seat full of PZKut. I couldn't make <br/>
out the license plate, but Gwen got out her binoculars and was able to <br/>
read a #12 in the license plate. I hope this helps your investigation <br/>
into this matter.<br/>

Stealthboxxer?! Say it isn't so! It doesn't seem like someone so<br/>
stealthy would pull out of DMS's driveway with screeching tires, but<br/>
then, what do we really know about this stealthy man?<br/>
<br/>
Hmm.... Mr. Bacon might have his hands full if it is indeed a fellow<br/>
PI he must investigate. Stealthboxxer makes his living covering up<br/>
other people's tracks as well as his own and surely won't be easy to<br/>
nail such a dasdardly crime on.<br/>

Boy, I tell you, I didn't see this twist coming!<br/>

We are forgetting one component here.  You speak of Don as an innocent<br/>
man, and accept his letterboxing log as proof that he wasn't involved<br/>
in this DASTARDLY crime, but I'm not so convinced.  Where was Gwen<br/>
during all this?  I have seen them box separately on occasion.  Who is<br/>
to say that Gwen wasn't out letterboxing and found the stamps that Don<br/>
had conveniently carved for her beforehand.  How do we know that Don<br/>
wasn't out accomplishing the deed while Gwen, who would never dream of<br/>
anything so heinous, was innocently letterboxing?  And how do we know<br/>
that they even stamped the right date on the logbooks?  I ask you . . .<br/>
<br/>
I don't know.  I have liked Don and Gwen, but I grow suspicious when<br/>
they so quickly point their fingers at Stealthboxer, and then a<br/>
certain Turtle jumps in to the mix as well.  I don't know.  I wonder<br/>
if they might be in cahoots.  You know, my sources tell me that this<br/>
turtle character has access to people with airplane accessibility. <br/>
How do we know they aren't all in the mix?  <br/>

See here Cadenza, this accusation has gone far enough. I didn't <br/>
point any fingers at anyone. I merely passed along what we saw on <br/>
the road home. Seems like you would believe Gwen, so here is her <br/>
statement below.<br/>
Don<br/>
<br/>
Don is a loving guy and wouldn't steal any white PZKut from any <br/>
carver, at least not their complete stash. While I would never call <br/>
Don innocent, he is not guilty of this crime. <br/>

Gwen is so forceful in her expressions of Don's innocense.  I fear she <br/>

She could have duped her loving, unsuspectng husband into providing <br/>
her alibi while she engaged in a dastardly deed of unspeakable <br/>

respond to Don's accusation.  I am a private investigator, and like<br/>
all private eyes my reputation is very important to my business.  I<br/>
simply have to respond.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I can say without any hesitation that I am not<br/>
responsible for the theft of Mr. Stamper's PZ Cut. That you will all<br/>
have to simply take my word on.  I could say more but<br/>
client/investigator priveledge prevents me from doing so.  You see, I<br/>
am working on a case currently and I cannot give any details of that<br/>
investigation at this time.  Suffice it to say that when Stealthboxxer<br/>
tells you he's not involved, then you can believe it.  <br/>
<br/>
But to the real matter at hand, Don's alleged recent sighting of me.<br/>
Well, there may be some truth to that account, but I tell you it has<br/>
nothing to do with the theft! It is true that I was recently in the<br/>
Eugene, Oregon area. In fact, anyone who cares to can verify this by<br/>
simply contacting the Eugene P.D. and obtaining a copy of the citation<br/>
given to me by the police.  You see, I was ticketed for speeding in<br/>
Eugene, going 29 miles per hour in a school zone. Can you believe<br/>
that? I got a ticket for speeding. (Oh, and by the way, in the process<br/>
I found out that the Eugene P.D. considers it a reckless offense to<br/>
drive with your knees while decyphering Ceasar cyphers.  Who would<br/>
have known?) <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I do not want to have to disclose this next piece of<br/>
information but I feel that I must for the sake of my own good name<br/>
and for the sake of my friend, Mr. DMS and for the hopeful recovery of<br/>
his PZ Cut. As I said before, it is true that I was recently driving<br/>
in the Eugene area. In fact, I was driving in my 1972 green<br/>
OldsmoBuick. However, I am not the only person who drives such a<br/>
vehicle. And although I appreciate the kind words said by Ryan in<br/>
regards to my reputation, I fear that those words may be just a ploy<br/>
to divert aspersions away from Ryan himself. It has come to my<br/>
attention that Ryan Carpenter, the Green Tortuga, is reputed to drive<br/>
a 1972 green OldsmoBuick too! <br/>
<br/>
Now, I cannot confirm this, I am not really working on this particular<br/>
case nor have I any firsthand knowledge of the Green Tortuga actually<br/>
driving a green OldsmoBuick. But, this information comes from a very<br/>
good, albeit undisclosed and secret source. And I trust that source<br/>
enough to make it public to this extent.<br/>
<br/>
So, you all should just keep a mind to watch our 'friend' Mr.<br/>
Carpenter and see if he suddenly begins to offer PZ cut for sale on<br/>
his site and leave old Stealthboxxer alone to his own case.  <br/>
<br/>
Thats all I have to say at this time on this matter.<br/>

&gt; My introspection also made me reconsider some of the <br/>
&gt; possibilities that I might have seen on our way northbound from San <br/>
&gt; Diego. I recall a vehicle heading south by what appeared to be <br/>
&gt; Stealthboxxer behind the wheel. <br/>

This is certainly making some sense now. I couldn't figure out why <br/>
Green Tortuga waited to agree that I was innocent of this crime <br/>
until after I posted our alibi. He probably waited to see if I <br/>
really had a good alibi and wanted to divert attention from himself. <br/>
It is interesting that only Amanda posted information about finding <br/>

With all due respect, even a nit-wit would know better than to accuse<br/>
Amanda or myself of such a dastardly crime. Anyone who knows me would<br/>
doubt any story about my getting caught driving in a green<br/>
OldsmoBuick. Let me count the ways:<br/>
<br/>
I'm a walker. I hiked from Georgia to Maine (documented proof can be<br/>
found at http://www.atlasquest.com/adventures/ ) and as everyone<br/>
knows, I don't like driving. To commit a heist with a car? Ha! If I<br/>
were of a criminal intent, my heist would be stealthy, and on foot.<br/>
<br/>
The car I do own is most certainly not green. That's the color of<br/>
puke. The car I do own is a healthy shade of silver. Nor is the car I<br/>
own an OldsmoBuick. It's an American-built Ford Taurus made by the<br/>
hard working men and women in Chicago, according the sticker on one of<br/>
the windows.<br/>
<br/>
And it's common knowledge that, as a rule of thumb, my car is not<br/>
considered reliable in any sense of the word. To depend on it for such<br/>
a heinous crime would be stupidity of the worst sort.<br/>
<br/>
The carving material Funhog caught me with in those early morning<br/>
hours was the pink stuff. Proof? I was carving one of the stamps for<br/>
Amanda's Citizen Kane in San Simeon, California. Find those boxes and<br/>
you'll have proof it was the pink stuff that was carved. (Clues listed<br/>
on Atlas Quest.)<br/>
<br/>
Funhog did admit that the light was dim, and pigs aren't well known<br/>
for their sense of sight to begin with. The backseat was, indeed,<br/>
piled high with bags, but that was because Amanda was traveling with<br/>
me and, well, you know how girls like to pack. Show me a girl<br/>
traveling light and I'll show you a monkey with a purple head.<br/>
<br/>
As for Don's comment about not recording any find for Little Bastard,<br/>
it's common knowledge that I do not reliably record all of my finds.<br/>
In fact, I have the logbook and pieces of the Little Bastard letterbox<br/>
that were in such great need of maintenance. They are now dried, if a<br/>
little worn, and currently in a padded envelope ready to be mailed<br/>
later this very afternoon. Are these the actions of a PZKut thief?<br/>
<br/>
The reason for my delayed defense of Don was simply that I do not<br/>
check this talk list every day. I have a life too, and I was shocked<br/>
and horrified at the accusations being thrown at Don. It wasn't until<br/>
a reliable source informed me of this incident did I check to see what<br/>
was going on, but by then, I was too late. The damage was done.<br/>
<br/>
But the fact of the matter is this: I've never carved a stamp using<br/>
PZKut. Not once. I prefer the pink stuff, though I have resorted to<br/>
MasterCarve if the pink stuff was scarce. Never have I ever resorted<br/>
to PZKut as those who have found my boxes can attest to.<br/>
<br/>
I am greatly saddened that anyone would even suspect me of such an<br/>
atrocious crime. For years I have toiled on Atlas Quest to make<br/>
letterboxing a hobby worthy of everyone's aspiration. Just last month<br/>
I followed in the footsteps of the Baker's dozen to the Promised Land<br/>
of Dartmoor. Those 13 men and women paved the way for a fuller<br/>
appreciation of our beloved hobby than ever before, and to suspect<br/>
Amanda or I would fall into such disgrace is, well, disgraceful.<br/>
<br/>
Focus your accusations on the more unsavory characters in our hobby.<br/>
Take Poison Ivy, for instance. Can you say POISON? Can you say IVY?<br/>
And his costumes and disguises are legendary! If you want to start<br/>
throwing around accusations, at least start throwing them in<br/>
directions where it might stick.<br/>
<br/>
I am as saddened as the next person over this atrocious crime, and I,<br/>
for one, am hoping the perp gets what he deserves. (Which, I might<br/>
add, is NOT a pile of PZKut.)<br/>

Sue &amp; I have had plumbing problems for a week! <br/>
No - not Sue or myself - our house!<br/>
<br/>
We've haven't had hot water since last Wednesday! And we've been busy dealing with the gas company (gas hot water heater), chimney sweeps, plumbers, masons, running to neighbors and relatives to shower and bathe. How in the world would we have had time to hop a quick plane to PDX, rent a car, find DMS' house, pilfer the PZ Kut and take the return trip???<br/>
<br/>
Cross country travel was strictly out of the question with phone calls and work orders and checking account deposits to make to cover the work being done at our home! Anyone on our street, 48 Pinecone Place, can verify that there have been a myriad of repair vehicles and all sorts of sundry work being done here at the Ranchero de Pepe.<br/>
<br/>
If necessary, we would be willing to forward permits, invoices, work orders and the like to both Inspector Bacon and the proper authorities in order to clear our names. <br/>
We are confidant of our complete vindication by DMS and all that is good in letterboxingdom.<br/>

Innocently yours,<br/>

&gt; Now things are falling into place. It just happens that I received a<br/>

from<br/>
&gt; a road trip to California the other day. It seems the two were <br/>
heading<br/>

shared<br/>
&gt; a little Mongolian hideway in a little-traveled park east of <br/>
Roseburg,<br/>
&gt; OR. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First thing in the morning, I spied the Turtle on his belly, still<br/>

&gt; have in his hand? Well, it dismays me to tell you that his right <br/>
hand<br/>
&gt; wielded a Speedball lino tool and the other... you guessed it...<br/>
&gt; carving medium. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Innocent of the big heist, I failed to inspect it carefully. The <br/>
light<br/>

As a man, we have a set of rules we must follow. One of them is to<br/>
never ask what a lady is packing. However, I can tell you this much:<br/>
It very well could be alien. The bags are of a normal size but of an<br/>
unusually heavy weight that never ceases to amaze those who must pick<br/>
them up. And being a road trip, she felt it would be acceptable to<br/>
bring a couple of "extra" bags. All her normal flight attendent gear<br/>
(including that heavy emergency manual all flight attendents are<br/>
required to carry--never know when it might be useful while driving<br/>
down I-5) as well as 'street gear' she normally would not carry while<br/>
working.<br/>
<br/>
Very odd indeed, but she packed more than I did and I won't be back<br/>
for at least a month!<br/>

Perhaps xray vision?  To find the purple skull guy? (sorry, folks, it was<br/>
begging for an aside)<br/>

Apologizing for enjoying this saga of misfortune,<br/>

Beaverton) and you can't stop us!!<br/>

My first thought about that last randsom note was Stealthboxxer but then I thought that <br/>
wouldn't be to sharp to use stealthy. Maybe someone is trying to set Stealthboxxer up!!<br/>
Does anyone know who would want to set Stealthboxxer up?<br/>
<br/>
or how about Mystreplacer? They seem to be from the NW but does anyone really know <br/>
anything about this mysterious letterboxer? I thought they were generous in adding to the <br/>
boxes around here but maybe they ran out of carving material or maybe they are kind of like <br/>
Robinhood!<br/>
<br/>
I must go hide my stash although it isn't grade A and I'm sure not even close to the amount <br/>
DMS was hording. Just how much was that DMS? I do hope you get it back but am finding this <br/>
quite amusing;-)<br/>

My first thought about the last note was Stealthboxxer but then that wouldn't be too bright to <br/>
use stealthy in the note. Maybe it is someone trying to set him up! Does anyone know who <br/>
would want to set him up or why?<br/>
<br/>
or what about Mystreplacer? They are new on the scene in the NW but does anyone really <br/>
know anything about them!? I thought they were kind of generous adding stamps to the <br/>
boxes around here but maybe they ran out of carving material or maybe they are kind of like <br/>
Robinhood!!<br/>
<br/>
I best go hide my carving material even though it isn't grade A and probably isn't nearly <br/>
1/10th of what DMS was hording. So just how much was there DMS? We do need to know <br/>
what we are looking for right? Anyway, I hope you get it back soon even though I am finding <br/>
this pretty amusing!<br/>
