Midwest.<br/>
<br/>
I think we should make the Great Lakes Gathering an annual tradition. <br/>
I've heard so many great things about what a fantastic job Spring <br/>
Chick did in organizing the event last year. SpringChick, if you're <br/>
reading this, I would love to attend an event that you organize for <br/>
this year, hint hint.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though, even though I don't think we'd get enough people to <br/>
come to Minnesota this year, (just not enough letterboxes here yet), <br/>
so I wouldn't be the best person to line a place up, I'd be more than <br/>
willing to help out with anything else I can, long distance, carving <br/>
event stamps, making food, etc.<br/>
