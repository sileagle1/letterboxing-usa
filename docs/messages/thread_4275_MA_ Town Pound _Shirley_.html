    I had noticed that clues for both Shirley boxes were no longer <br/>
posted.  I don't know if that is related.<br/>
    I would send you over to Moments to Celebrate, but I have a <br/>
strong report that it is missing, perhaps before it was EVER stamped <br/>
into.<br/>

Dan, Max, and I found the Town Pound box in July.  The box was still in it's<br/>
hiding spot, but the stamp and book were both missing.  At the time there<br/>
were some postcards in the box stamped with the original image, we took one<br/>
of those to put in our book, and stamped our stamps on a piece of paper and<br/>
left it in the box.  The other Shirley box was in good condition though,<br/>
with nothing missing.  Good Luck<br/>

1/26/02:<br/>
<br/>
"Town Pound " and "Listen My Children" are boxes<br/>
that placed - I did check the status back in<br/>
October when I went south to visit y Mom:<br/>
<br/>
"TownPound" is as reported back in July - box<br/>
there, book and stamp missing.<br/>
At tat time, "Listen My Children" was intact and<br/>
in the right location. There had been some<br/>
construction (roadwork) fairly near, but the box<br/>
was unharmed totally. These are both on private<br/>
land - perhaps the Pound was "dissected", to<br/>
protect the surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
Next time I go down,  I'll try to replace "Pound",<br/>
although I can't say when.  I'd very much<br/>
appreciate hearing if the other box is still<br/>
there. However, as it is in a VERY visible but<br/>
unlikely trod location, perhaps a few red herrings<br/>
in the snow would help if the box is still there.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>
