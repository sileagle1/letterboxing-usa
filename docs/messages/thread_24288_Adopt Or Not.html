from physically being able to maintain all their boxes unless they <br/>
only plant in their hometown.  However, there is nothing we can do <br/>
about the clues of boxers who have left the game, so that is the <br/>
tougher problem.  We have a boxer who no longer participates, but <br/>
will not repond to offers of adoption.  Many of the boxes are missing, <br/>
but since the clues can't be updated, new boxers continue to try for <br/>
them and become frustrated upon learning the situation.  So, do we <br/>
adopt without permission or respect the rights of the artist?  I <br/>
personally think adopting without permission is acceptable in this <br/>
case, as long as the original author is still given credit and the <br/>
only change to the clues is a status entry.  If the original author <br/>
objects in the future, they can take the boxes back.  If a letteboxer <br/>
feels strongly that none of their boxes should ever be adopted, maybe<br/>
a disclaimer should be added at the bottom of the clues.  I don't <br/>
recommend this, though, because what happens when you die?  Oh yeah, <br/>
you said that topic was not worth discussing when I brought it up a <br/>
few weeks ago; nevermind.<br/>

<br/>
Last year I tried to find a box that had the clues on LB.org.  We could not<br/>
find the box.  And other searchers previously had not either.  Very straight<br/>
forward clues, the box was just gone. On LB.org the box was listed as<br/>
Unclaimed.  I do not know the history of how it became listed as such.   The<br/>
trail name of the original placer was in the clues but when I contacted the<br/>
person who I could find with that same trail name they said no, it wasn't<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I expressed concerned and said that I would be willing to adopt the box if<br/>
it was adoptable.  I even ask on the yahoo group and people who knew of the<br/>
box (but not the placer) encouraged adoption.  LB.org agreed.<br/>
<br/>
LB.org transferred to me.  I had intended on either placing the box in the<br/>
same exact location, or very very close, keeping all the clues intact.  But<br/>
after going back to the location we determined that the spot was really not<br/>
hidden well enough and there was nothing very nearby to move it to.<br/>
<br/>
So our new location is actually in a different spot on the same property.  I<br/>
have kept a lot of the original verbiage but the clues are changed enough<br/>
that is now about 50% original and 50% new.<br/>
<br/>
So now my question.  Is this the same box anymore?  It will have the same<br/>
name.  I intend on keeping the original planter's trailname in the clues,<br/>
saying that we have adopted it.<br/>
<br/>
But have we?  It's a new stamp, I have no idea what the original even looked<br/>
like.  It's a new final hiding place.  How should I handle this?  Should the<br/>
clues be just deleted and I add this as a new plant with no mention of the<br/>
old box or placer?  If so I would have to reword all of the clues, I think,<br/>
so that none of if it would be the original planter's words.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What is so difficult about simply taking the clues offline if it's fairly<br/>
certain that a box is  missing and it's completely certain that the placer<br/>
can no longer be contacted by the webmaster?  If the box is truly missing,<br/>
then obviously it either was trash long ago or will never be trash, since<br/>
it's not there any longer to be trash.<br/>
<br/>
Why must a box which has already gone missing be adopted?  What exactly *is*<br/>
it that you're adopting if the box is missing?<br/>
<br/>
Simply take the clues off the website.  If someone feels that site is so<br/>
absolutely terrific that it just must have a letterbox placed there, then<br/>
they can place a letterbox of their own there.  Why do they need to adopt<br/>
one that's already missing?  If a webmaster can take the time to set it up<br/>
to allow another boxer access to those clues, then the webmaster can take<br/>
the even less time to simply delete the clues.  If the placer reappears,<br/>
they can put the clues back.<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn't, of course, keep someone from reposting the clues under their<br/>
own name and grabbing the stamp and box for themselves if the box *wasn't*<br/>
missing.  But, on the other hand, these "adoptions" are supposedly being<br/>
done by "good" people, or so they and their friends seem to always say, so<br/>
that sort of stealing shouldn't be happening, right?<br/>
<br/>
So in answer to your question, to me it's incredibly simple.  There's no<br/>
reason not to respect the rights of the artist and not steal the clues, not<br/>
steal a box that's no longer there, but remove those clues from the website<br/>
and place a box in that park/preserve/etc yourself with your own carved<br/>
design and your own clues.<br/>
<br/>
See, to me, it's quite simple.  The artwork belongs to the artist.  In my<br/>
opinion.  And it's not a humble opinion.  :-)  But the right to list that<br/>
box on LbNA is not necessarily a "right."  Rules can be established and put<br/>
out there right upfront.  Make some sort of rule, a rule that's stated right<br/>
where it can be easily seen on the website, that if the webmaster cannot<br/>
contact the placer, the webmaster has the right to remove the clues from<br/>
LbNA.  That way, nobody can be accused of attempting to "take over" anyone<br/>
else's artwork.<br/>
<br/>
As to another poster who mentioned the flood of trash that would result from<br/>
not allowing adoptions, hogwash.   Far more boxes are turned into "trash" by<br/>
irresponsible placers and/or irresponsible finders than will ever be turned<br/>
into trash from being abandoned by their placers.  If we're going to worry<br/>
about trash in the environment, then we should talk about not allowing a<br/>
good many placers and/or finders to have any part of LbNA given the fact<br/>
that their irresponsibility has turned letterboxes into "trash."  A box<br/>
originally well hidden by the placer and a box that's responsibly<br/>
*re*-hidden by a finder stands little chance of becoming "trash" even if<br/>
nobody shows up for the next 200 years to take care of it.<br/>
<br/>
Word-of-mouth begins to look better and better and better and better and<br/>
better..............<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, I actually shouldn't be in the discussion :-), since I<br/>
took my boxes off LbNA and atlasquest long ago and put them on my own<br/>
website, one of the two reasons being so that nobody else could decide to<br/>
claim them without my permission.  So y'all can go fight out when the slope<br/>
begins to become a little too slippery for comfort, it really shouldn't<br/>
concern me.<br/>

According to the neighborhood, the teen boys supposedly learned about<br/>
letterboxing from the sister of one of them who learned about it via Girl<br/>
Scouts in the area.  The sister learned about discretion and to be very very<br/>
responsible about re-hiding the box well because of how frustrating and<br/>
depressing it can be for someone to do a lot of searching for a box that was<br/>
missing due to irresponsible re-hiding.  She passed this on to her brother,<br/>
who supposedly got together with some of his friends.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the teen boys supposedly thought............hmmm..........frustrated<br/>
adults..........depressed adults..........possibly really angry<br/>
adults..............might be great on youtube.  :-)  But after awhile, not<br/>
so many people were searching for the box anymore plus the boys supposedly<br/>
got concerned that they might get in trouble, so they decided to rename the<br/>
box and title it "Unclaimed" and have a contact address that wouldn't really<br/>
work out if anyone tried to use it, in hopes that nobody could trace exactly<br/>
who placed-but-didn't-place the box.  :-)  Better than wasting their time on<br/>
videogames I guess.   Could be worse.<br/>

&gt; In this vein, I have a query.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last year I tried to find a box that had the clues on LB.org.  We<br/>
could not<br/>
&gt; find the box.  And other searchers previously had not either.  Very<br/>
straight<br/>
&gt; forward clues, the box was just gone. On LB.org the box was listed as<br/>
&gt; Unclaimed.  I do not know the history of how it became listed as<br/>
such.   The<br/>
&gt; trail name of the original placer was in the clues but when I<br/>
contacted the<br/>
&gt; person who I could find with that same trail name they said no, it<br/>
wasn't<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I expressed concerned and said that I would be willing to adopt the<br/>
box if<br/>
&gt; it was adoptable.  I even ask on the yahoo group and people who knew<br/>
of the<br/>
&gt; box (but not the placer) encouraged adoption.  LB.org agreed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; LB.org transferred to me.  I had intended on either placing the box<br/>
in the<br/>
&gt; same exact location, or very very close, keeping all the clues<br/>
intact.  But<br/>
&gt; after going back to the location we determined that the spot was<br/>
really not<br/>
&gt; hidden well enough and there was nothing very nearby to move it to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So our new location is actually in a different spot on the same<br/>
property.  I<br/>
&gt; have kept a lot of the original verbiage but the clues are changed<br/>
enough<br/>
&gt; that is now about 50% original and 50% new.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So now my question.  Is this the same box anymore?  It will have the<br/>
same<br/>
&gt; name.  I intend on keeping the original planter's trailname in the<br/>
clues,<br/>
&gt; saying that we have adopted it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But have we?  It's a new stamp, I have no idea what the original<br/>
even looked<br/>
&gt; like.  It's a new final hiding place.  How should I handle this? <br/>
Should the<br/>
&gt; clues be just deleted and I add this as a new plant with no mention<br/>
of the<br/>
&gt; old box or placer?  If so I would have to reword all of the clues, I<br/>
think,<br/>
&gt; so that none of if it would be the original planter's words.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
