<p>     I wont try to speak for the others youve mentioned, but Im not going to let you use me to corroborate your normality.  Come on, Jay.  You have more boxes than the combined total of all those youve mentioned.  I box out of boredom, not obsession.  My wife ran off with a circus dwarf a couple of years ago, and I dont like sports.  Lucy has all but ruined television for me.  I get queasy and short of breath when I even look at the remote.  I make these as a way to wile away my free time.  It keeps me out of the bars.</p>
<p>     As a medical professional, you know that self diagnosis is a difficult thing.  But certainly, you can recognize the voice of denial.  Everyone who boxes has a mutant gene?  Were all kind of sick?  I think that it might be time to do an intervention.  Because of the lack of comity generally displayed on these pages, I think that we can assume that were all friends here (after all, who can fight better than family?) so it is up to us to intercede.  Ill get the ball rolling. </p>
<p>     Jay, we love you and we care about you.  You have a boxing problem.  You need help. </p>

<p>     By the way, your daydream about the 50 year old box is myopic.  Im designing mine for the hundred year lifecycle, and I imagine some of those Mapsurfer boxes will be around forever, with crusty stamps still in want of a first inking.</p>

<p>     As a medical professional, you know that self 
  diagnosis is a difficult thing.  But certainly, you can recognize the 
  voice of denial.  Everyone who boxes has a mutant gene?  Were all 
  kind of sick?  I think that it might be time to do an intervention.  
  Because of the lack of comity generally displayed on these pages, I think that 
  we can assume that were all friends here (after all, who can fight better than 
  family?) so it is up to us to intercede.  Ill get the ball rolling. </p>
<p>     Jay, we love you and we care about you.  You 
  have a boxing problem.  You need help. </p>
<p>     Id ask Aili to start another letterboxing 
  subgroup, letterboxers_anonymous, but by definition, a group has more than one 
  person in it.  Those fellas out in Ohio are suspect, though.  We 
  might have to pull the plug on the whole state.  Well have to wait and 
  see if there emerges a class of people who just cant handle their boxing. 
   But for now, it is evident that you are <em>sui generis</em>. Get some 
  help.</p>
<p>     By the way, your daydream about the 50 year old 
  box is myopic.  Im designing mine for the hundred year lifecycle, and I 
  imagine some of those Mapsurfer boxes will be around forever, with crusty 
  stamps still in want of a first inking.</p>
