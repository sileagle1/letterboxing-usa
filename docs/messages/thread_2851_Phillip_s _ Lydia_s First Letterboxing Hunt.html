                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, my name is Phillip and my sister is Lydia.  We are from St. Louis <br/>
and are in Richmond visiting our Papa and Kathy.  We found our first <br/>
letterbox two days ago and it was fun.  To get to Belle Isle we had <br/>
to walk across a large bridge and that was pretty neat looking down <br/>
at the water.  I was the one who read the clues so everyone knew <br/>
where to go.  Kathy showed me how to use a compass.  The trail was <br/>
rough in some places and there were lots of steep drops down to the <br/>
river.  When we found the box I was like Wow!  Kathy told us we had <br/>
to be quiet and get out of sight of the other people walking down the <br/>
trail.  We found a spot to sit down and stamped in with the new <br/>
stamps that Kathy carved for us that day.  <br/>
<br/>
We also planted our first letterbox at Belle Isle.  We like Richmond <br/>
a lot so our letterbox is named "We Love Richmond".  We hope lots of <br/>
people will visit it so when we come visit next time we can see their <br/>
stamps.  Finding a good hiding spot was fun and Kathy will put the <br/>
clues on the website soon.<br/>
<br/>
We checked the website for boxes in St. Louis and can't wait to get <br/>
home to try to find them.  Pretty soon we are moving to Colorado <br/>
Springs and will look for letterboxes there too.  <br/>

HI Phillip &amp; Lydia,<br/>
<br/>
 We look forward to running into you while letterboxing in and around the St. <br/>
Louis Area.  Hope you make it over to the Illinois side to pick up some of <br/>
our boxes too!<br/>
