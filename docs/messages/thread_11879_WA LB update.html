<br/>
Cowlitz Falls--doing well, a couple of visitors (replaced a ziploc)<br/>
Bevin Lake--doing well, a couple of visitors<br/>
Maywood Park--doing well, first visitors (couldn't believe that)<br/>
Elbe Train--doing well, many, many visitors (mostly geocachers who <br/>
dabble in LBing)<br/>
Nursing the Fir--doing well, first visitors (wierd--we gave folks a <br/>
several day advantage)<br/>
<br/>
Chambers Creek Duck &amp; Salmon--both well, several visitors<br/>
Pandemonium--doing well, with 2 visitors<br/>
Where the Wild Things Are--doing well with a dozen+ visitors (go <br/>
figure? why didn't people hit Pandemonium, too?--I'm thinking the <br/>
clues might not be posted?)<br/>
Buggy, Centralia--alive &amp; well &amp; very, very lonely!!!<br/>
Fudrick's 2 Burfoot Park boxes--both doing well and well camouflaged<br/>
dvn2r ckr's 2 Burfoot Park boxes--both well, a few visitors<br/>
Majestic Mystery--alive &amp; well &amp; very, very lonely!!!<br/>
<br/>
There are a few others but I can't remember them off the top of my <br/>
head!<br/>
<br/>
Oh--must've told about a dozen people about letterboxing--most of <br/>
whom seemed sincerely interested in the hobby.  We'll see if they <br/>
pop up on the radar anytime soon...  ;)  <br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail!<br/>
