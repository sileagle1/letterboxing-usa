                    <div class="plaintext-content">thanks for the info, but i was wondering if there were boxes not <br/>
listed on the LBNA since the boxes listed are just too far away to <br/>
find in a 2 hour time limit.  <br/>
<br/>
but maybe letterboxing is not that popular in springfield.  i'll keep <br/>
looking for personal pages for clues however.  i always try to find <br/>
one geocache and one letterbox on each of my trips. it gets me out of <br/>
the hotel for a couple of nights!<br/>
