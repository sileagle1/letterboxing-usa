<div>Chris,</div>

<div>I am not so sure I agree with zeusdog933. Early on 
in the Fredericksburg, VA area (2 years ago) I was the only boxer. I 
offered two, 1 hour training  seminars in a 6 month period at the 
local library and got a total of 6 people to show. Our Library does a nice 
job of advertising in local paper and via posters in all the branches.  It 
may depend on how large the city you live in and the circulation of the 
paper. I was interviewed for the Blue Ridge Outdoors, a monthly free magazine 
that covers the Blue Ridge area of VA and WVA including all the major 
universities and colleges.  I really haven't seen an appreciable increase 
in LB activity.   Your call but I say a little rain in a 
desert makes the flowers bloom... (Sorry!!!!!)  </div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's a thought, for what it's worth.  Why not have<br/>
this be part of your program (much like the Valley<br/>
Quest, I'm finding) and have groups of campers make<br/>
and hide boxes?  Then have a family day of 'finding<br/>
the boxes' of each of the groups.  This is bound to<br/>
get someone hooked on it as this is a great family<br/>
activity.  <br/>
<br/>
This keeps it to a small group of people without<br/>
letting out our 'secret passion' to hordes of people<br/>
with perhaps less than honorable intentions. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then, who knows but I'll bet you someone in that small<br/>
group will be as hooked as we are and will start<br/>
planting and finding more...<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

For example, I doubt that your average letterbox-stealing hooligan is <br/>
in the habit of reading Smithsonian or US Airways Attache.  Likewise, <br/>
one doesn't usually encounter hordes of Rotarians raping &amp; pillaging <br/>
their way across the countryside.<br/>
Consider who will likely be reading the article.<br/>
