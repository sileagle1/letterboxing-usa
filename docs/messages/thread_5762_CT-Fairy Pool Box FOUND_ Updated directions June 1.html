                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
First, I want to apologize to the people who couldn't<br/>
find the box. Believe me, I hate it when it happens to<br/>
me. I guess I learned the instant gratification<br/>
syndrome too well from the previous generation.<br/>
Anyway, I'm sorry it was so difficult to find. I see<br/>
now why it was so hard. The area looks completely<br/>
different from when I placed it in March. The hints I<br/>
left were too vague for the current conditions.<br/>
However, some intepid explorers did find it. Even<br/>
though one wrote I was a "maniac". With that said, you<br/>
now have an idea of how rugged the area is. I didn't<br/>
make that clear either. Believe it or not, I actually<br/>
walked right down the actual brook rocks themselves.<br/>
It was fun to me, not to others, apparently. That was<br/>
the idea, though. I wanted something different.<br/>
Nevertheless, you should probably stick terra firma<br/>
and not the slippery, wet, mossey, stream rocks.<br/>
Although, that isn't 100% safe either. I stepped into<br/>
a three foot deep hole that was disguised as a wet<br/>
spot of leaves. I still thought it was cool. Use<br/>
caution and go with a partner and hopefully you think<br/>
I over exaggereated how rough the area is. You will<br/>
have to bushwack. NO TRAILS. Hopefully, I don't need<br/>
to say this, but bring a compass. To me, the area is<br/>
special and beautiful. I find it worth the drive<br/>
everytime. I strongly suggest going when it has just<br/>
rained heavily. Or better yet, when it is raining<br/>
heavily. Much more atmosphere. Of course, much more<br/>
dangerous if you walk the rocks.<br/>
<br/>
The Fairy Pool<br/>
Glastonbury, Connecticut<br/>
<br/>
Your name: John at liberumarbitrium@yahoo.com<br/>
The name of the letterbox: The Fairy Pool<br/>
The date you placed it: 03-30-02<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: No trail to follow!!!! Not long trip,<br/>
(1000yards taking .50 of an hour or more, one way) but<br/>
rocky, slippery, wet conditions. Heavily overgrown<br/>
with green stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: In the summer, absolutely incredible<br/>
amounts of moss. Stunning colors of green. Really neat<br/>
glacial till that is exposed from the stream run-off.<br/>
It looks like boulder gardens. <br/>
Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I placed a box in the Meshomasic State Forest in<br/>
Glastonbury. Please wear footwear that will help you<br/>
negotiate wet, slippery rocks, and stream crossings.<br/>
Glastonbury does have rattlesnakes, so use caution.<br/>
<br/>
 From the Hartford area, take exit 10 off of Rt.2 and<br/>
take a right onto Rt83 (Manchester Rd.). Go .10 mile<br/>
to stop sign and take a left onto New London<br/>
Turnpike\Wassauc road.<br/>
<br/>
 Coming from the Marlborough area take exit 10 off<br/>
Rt.2 and take a left onto Rt.83 (Manchester Rd.). Go<br/>
about .25 mile and take left onto New London<br/>
Turnpike\Wassauc road.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, go about a mile to your first stop sign. At the<br/>
stop sign you're at the corner of Wassauc Road and<br/>
Country Club Road. Take a right onto Country Club<br/>
Road. (On your way home, if you came from the<br/>
Marlborough area, you can take a right onto Wassauc Rd<br/>
to get Rt.2 about a .5-mile away or just retrace your<br/>
route back)<br/>
<br/>
 Drive down, then up Country Club Road to an obviously<br/>
dangerous intersection. Take Mott Hill Road on the<br/>
left. Be EXTREMELY careful at this crossing. It is<br/>
blind both ways and people fly down the road from the<br/>
actual country club.<br/>
<br/>
 (From the start of Mott Hill Road the box is about 2<br/>
miles away.)<br/>
<br/>
 From the start of Mott Hill drive about 1 mile and<br/>
you'll come to a fork. There will be a sign that says<br/>
dead end to the left. GO RIGHT. The road quickly turns<br/>
to dirt.<br/>
<br/>
 You'll be on Del Reeves Road. Drive approx. 1 mile <br/>
and you'll pass a large graffitoed boulder on the<br/>
left, just before you come to the Fairy Pool. Drive<br/>
until you see, on BOTH sides, a small cement culvert. <br/>
The right (roughly North) side of the road is your<br/>
start point, at the culvert.  Park just past it on the<br/>
left.<br/>
<br/>
 Go to the start point. Today, June 15th, it was about<br/>
2-3 feet deep and an aquamarine blue. The heavy rains<br/>
make the area magical. This culvert area is the Fairy<br/>
Pool. I couldn't hide the box here...too easy and<br/>
you'd miss the beauty of the brook.<br/>
<br/>
 Follow the brook DOWNSTREAM. You really can't go<br/>
wrong if you just follow the brook downstream. Take<br/>
time to enjoy the various pools, trees growing on<br/>
rocks, moss, and landscape. Today it was amazing. All<br/>
the rain made this area energetic and stunning. (In<br/>
the spring or fall-Look for the yellow birch that is<br/>
growing in the middle of the stream on a rock. Look<br/>
for a washing machine sized rock that has a<br/>
waffle-pattern of quartz on its Eastern face. These<br/>
aren't landmarks, more just FYI's.)<br/>
<br/>
The following directions were written when there was<br/>
little growth and you could see around. You can use<br/>
them if you want. I would suggest, in the summer, just<br/>
following the brook down to the penninsula: <br/>
<br/>
 The brook goes roughly North East for about 100-200<br/>
paces.<br/>
<br/>
 Then juts East for about 20 paces.<br/>
<br/>
 Hooks North again for about 70-100 paces. (Again<br/>
paces aren't that important here, just follow brook)<br/>
<br/>
 Go another 80 paces over more rocks.<br/>
<br/>
 The rocks will drop you to an area of what appears to<br/>
be an island surrounded by a small rivulet. This small<br/>
island\pennisula area seems to get more light than the<br/>
surrounding areas in the summer. <br/>
<br/>
To the LEFT or WEST is another stream entering this<br/>
mini river. The river is shaped like a horseshoe<br/>
pointing away from you.<br/>
To the RIGHT or EAST is a Yellow Birch that has fallen<br/>
across the stream. <br/>
GO LEFT, upstream, towards the rivulet. This is where<br/>
you can cross onto the penninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Or get across the river to this peninsula island<br/>
anyway you can. <br/>
<br/>
Once on the island find the tree, on the south side of<br/>
the island, that has a rectangular hole cut into its<br/>
east face about waist level. A beer can has been<br/>
placed into the hole. Not that anyone would bother to<br/>
pick up litter, but don't expect the can to be there.<br/>
I have also places four mellon sized rocks in a rough<br/>
circle at, NOT AROUND, the base of this tree too. The<br/>
tree is only about a foot or so in diameter inches in<br/>
diameter. This tree would be one of the closet tree to<br/>
the stream you crossed. <br/>
<br/>
 From this tree face North and walk about 10-15 paces<br/>
or about 30-35 feet. I've placed three yellow birch<br/>
trees, 4-6 inches in diameter, about 4-6 feet long,<br/>
laying end to end pointing off in the direction you<br/>
want to go. You'll see a fallen, rotted, branchless,<br/>
tree lying West to East. It really doesn't look like<br/>
much, so don't expect a fallen Live Oak or something<br/>
exotic. It's old and rotting and the last person there<br/>
didn't even cover up the box and it still wasn't<br/>
found. I did cover it, please do to.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the Eastern end of the fallen tree. The tree is<br/>
pretty long but skinny. <br/>
<br/>
 To go home, just head South back up stream. Thanks<br/>
for visiting. Let me know if you have any trouble<br/>
finding it, again.<br/>
<br/>
John<br/>
