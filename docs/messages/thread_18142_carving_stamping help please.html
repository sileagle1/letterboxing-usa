I wish I could remember if it's on Der Mad Stamper's site or not, but <br/>
somewhere I read that there's a permanent ink that will adhere to the <br/>

PZKut seems to have a good side and a bad side, but I have used both <br/>
and it accepts ink pretty well. You might try sanding with 400 wet <br/>
or dry sand paper and a different type of ink. Some folks really <br/>
like PZ Kut and others prefer a different type of medium. If there <br/>
is ant one out there that wants to rid themselves of their PZKut let <br/>
me know.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's a couple of more ideas that you might wanna try.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes in there is a film of mold release left on the material <br/>
that can prevent the ink from sticking to the stamp. Try washing it <br/>
off. I like to use a product called Simple Green.<br/>
<br/>
If that still don't help then you can try roughing up the surface a <br/>
tiny bit. Take some fine grit sandpaper at least 800 grit and gently <br/>
sand the surface of the stamp you carved. That bit of roughness will <br/>
give the ink something to grab on to. When I do this I use 1200 or <br/>
1500 grit wet to dry sandpaper.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that was mentioned by some others was about mounting <br/>
the stamp so theres a solid and firm surface for the stamp. Chekc <br/>
the links area from the homepage of this yahoogroup. I think Bindle <br/>
Babe put a link in there for a mounting tutorial she has on <br/>
picturetrail.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've had a similar experience with certain types of inks I've used <br/>
with PZKut--it may have something to do with how you transfer your <br/>
images to the carving medium.  If you use the acetone (nail polish <br/>
remover) method then it may leave some residue on the surface that <br/>
doesn't mix well with water or whatever other substances are found <br/>
in some inks.  You could try to clean it off with different types of <br/>
cleansers and it may work better?  I prefer to use dye based ink <br/>
stamp pads or cat eye pigment inks with the PZKut and they seem to <br/>
work well.  I also use the higher quality professional drafting <br/>
markers (with the paintbrush tips) without any problems, too. Simply <br/>
color the stamp with the various markers and then BREATHE on it to <br/>
remoisten it before you stamp the image on the paper.  I've noticed <br/>
that if I use a cheaper kind of marker such as Crayola or colored <br/>
markers from IKEA that the ink doesn't cover the image--it just <br/>
seems to bead up on the surface and it stamps terribly.  I recommend <br/>
just experimenting with different types of ink &amp; markers until you <br/>
find what works.  I personally love the PZKut and really don't use <br/>
any other carving medium anymore--except maybe some stray pieces of <br/>
the speedball 'pink stuff' that might be laying around.<br/>
<br/>
If you use the tracing paper/lead pencil transfer method, you may <br/>
have a similar problem unless you clean off the lead before you try <br/>
to stamp it.  If you use the ball point pen drawing the image on the <br/>
surface, you may get stray marks of ball point ink when you stamp <br/>
with it using light colored inks for a while unless you clean those <br/>
off, too.  One thing I've done on a few stamps that 'beg for <br/>
multiple colors' is actually color the stamp with various colored <br/>
Sharpie marking permanent pens (like the laundry marker pens) that <br/>
you can get in all sorts of colors these days.  Sometimes coloring <br/>
the image with these pens may make it easier for future inks to <br/>
adhere, othertimes it may make it more difficult depending on what <br/>
kind of ink/markers you use.  I've learned through the school of <br/>
hard knocks is that the 'better quality' inks/markers seem to work <br/>
abundantly better with PZKut.<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of this thesis helps you resolve your problem,<br/>

I usually use the lid to the stamp pad for even pressure during the <br/>
testing/carving phase (and sometimes in the feild, as well). I don't <br/>
invest the time or effort of affixing a stamp to anything until I'm <br/>
sure the stamp's a goodun... When it's done, I use a lightweight, <br/>
barely flexible plastic material about 1/8 inch thick that can be cut <br/>
to size with a regular utility knife or a bandsaw.<br/>

<br/>
I'm not a particular fan of backing stamps as I prefer a flexible <br/>
medium when stamping into my logbook most of the time but <br/>
occasionally some stamps just need a little more support.  {I also <br/>
haven't quite mastered that professional look after adhering the <br/>
stamp to the backing (of course, I haven't tried using a vice yet <br/>
either so that may be part of the problem).}<br/>
<br/>
As we're nearing the end of a 3+ year home renovation, I had several <br/>
dozen 'formica' countertop sample chips laying around the house.  I <br/>
learned that they make great stamp backings for stamps you'd like to <br/>
reinforce.  I simply glued the 'wood' side of the 'chip' to the <br/>
stamp and used the formica side as the side that was exposed--partly <br/>
because it was too smooth to make a nice solid bond with the <br/>
stamping material.  (Used Household Goop Adhesives--they now have an <br/>
outdoor waterproof Goop available!)  Of course, I don't condone <br/>
knicking such samples from the hardware stores just for this hobby--<br/>
if you have them laying around heading to the landfill, however, <br/>
that may be another story.  Prior to finding these, I'd been looking <br/>
for veneers to use in a similar fashion.  I've also found that paint <br/>
stirring sticks or wood shims for installing cabinetry/countertops <br/>
make great stamp backing materials if you cut them down to the <br/>
desired size and sand them to get rid of the splinters--the taper <br/>
doesn't seem to be a problem when stamping with it.  I've also <br/>
experimented with using other left over renovation materials as <br/>
stamp backings--crown moulding, picture railing, whatever little <br/>
bits of wood we have lying around.  They all seem to do the job--<br/>
especially if you have tiny stamps with which you are working.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!  <br/>

I found someone selling professional hardwood stamp backers on eBay. I was able to purchase a lot of 15 different sizes. They even have fingertip grooves and are exactly like the wooden blocks to which "bought" stamps are mounted.<br/>
<br/>
They make a great looking stamp - just wish my carving was better!!<br/>

&gt; STAMP BACKING MATERIALS???<br/>
<br/>
Scoutdogs told me about a great backer to use with PZKut that is<br/>
flexible but still firm, it's the 1/4" foam material used for door<br/>
knob hangers (think do not disturb signs) avaible in crafts stores<br/>
like Michaels.  The glue she uses has no solvents and isn't harmful,<br/>
so no special ventilation precautions need to be taken: 'Elmer's Craft<br/>
Bond'.  Elmer's makes a lot of glues, some with similar names but this<br/>
is the one to use.  Works even in boxes kept outside over the winter.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've used this and it's very easy.  The foam can be cut with scissors,<br/>
and I've sat in my living room and glued it up.  Easy, not stinky,<br/>
quick clean up.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have noticed that about PZKut also -- some pieces more than <br/>
others.  It seems to be less porous and ink from water-based markers <br/>
and even some types of ink pads seems to just bead up on it.<br/>
<br/>
One reason may be leftover ink or penci lfrom your image transfer.  <br/>
If you get your image onto the PZKut with pencil or do heat or <br/>
acetone transfer of a toner-based image, the ink or pencil remnants <br/>
on the carving material will deter the ink.  Try wiping away all <br/>
traces of pencil and ink with acetone before stamping with it.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing you can do if you are using PZKut to get the images to <br/>
stamp better is to use a permanent ink to stamp a couple of times -- <br/>
I use Memories Black Ink (dye-based), but you should be able to use <br/>
any permanent dye or pigment ink.  After there is a coating of ink <br/>
permanently adhered to the PZKut, it seems to take other ink much <br/>
better.<br/>
