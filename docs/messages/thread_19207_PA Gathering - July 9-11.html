<br/>
Again, those of you on multiple lists, sorry for the multiple posts!<br/>
<br/>
Camping<br/>
Those who are planning to attend the entire weekend and join us camping at Colonial Woods Campground need to make their reservations soon or risk not getting a site. Sue called from the campground to advise she has been holding 13 sites since labor day, 4 have been rented by us (and two trailer sites) and she is getting calls from people wanting to camp that weekend. She will no longer hold the sites. If you are thinking about camping, you need to make a decision quick and call Sue at 610-847-5808.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday Gathering<br/>
Those planning to attend the Saturday gathering at Washington Crossing don't really need to do anything except show up! But it would be nice if you wanted to bring some cold drinks or snacky stuff or cut up hoagies or something. Please let me know if you would like to bring something. thanks!<br/>
<br/>
The shirts are coming along fine. Artwork is in and being proofed, I am placing the final order tomorrow. All checks have been deposited. <br/>
<br/>
This should be a blast, hope to see you there!!<br/>
