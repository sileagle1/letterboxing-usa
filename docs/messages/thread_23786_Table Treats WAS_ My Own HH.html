Nothing in the glossaries and nothing when you Google. I think this  <br/>
is cool name for these types of boxes. Of course I am assuming or   <br/>
reading into the name assuming that it means a letterbox that is  <br/>
usually placed during an event on a table in plain view but is  <br/>
disguised as something else, ie a jar of maraschino cherries, a bag  <br/>
of wipes, or a round of cheese.<br/>

&gt; &gt; - Hitchhikers count when initially planted by their<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hitchhikers are letterboxes like anything else, therefore<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I didn't take it since it said there had to be 2 HHs there. There<br/>
