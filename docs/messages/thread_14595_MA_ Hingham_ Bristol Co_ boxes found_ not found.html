<br/>
Saturday morning we loaded up the kayaks and enjoyed a pleasant <br/>
little tour of Hingham Harbor, Hingham, MA.  Along the way we snagged <br/>
all three Pirates of Hingham Harbor boxes, the first visitors to do <br/>
so in the nearly *two years* since they were placed by Lonemasswolf.  <br/>
All three were in place, dry, and intact.  The Sarah Island box had a <br/>
little bit of water in it, but the log was well-bagged.  Seagulls <br/>
screamed at us as we stamped in. <br/>
<br/>
If you have access to a kayak, canoe, rowboat -- even water wings -- <br/>
we encourage you to make your way to these lonely boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Next we headed down to Bristol County to begin collecting boxes in a <br/>
counter-clockwise direction.<br/>
<br/>
Sister Road, Sister Town, Manfield, was in place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
Flight of the Bumbble Bee, Attleboro, was in place, dry, and intact.  <br/>
If Al and his daughter are reading this, thanks for the pizza place <br/>
tip! <br/>
<br/>
This Rocks!: Anawan Rock, Rehoboth, was missing.  We found where it <br/>
should be, but this spot appears to be a magnet for beer-drinking <br/>
partiers, and there was no trace of the box.<br/>
<br/>
This Rocks!: Dighton Rock, Dighton, was in  place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
This Rocks!: Profile Rock, Freetown, was in place, dry, and intact.  <br/>
We didn't see any UFOs.<br/>
<br/>
Joshua's Mountain, Freetown, was in place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
That did it for us for Saturday.  After a good night's rest we <br/>
ventured out again somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
John, Paul, and George were in place, dry, and intact.  Where's <br/>
Ringo?  We'd love to know.  Once again Brian has left us salivating.<br/>
<br/>
The Trees: Winter Giant, Former Splendor, and New Beginnings, Fall <br/>
River, were all found in place, dry, and intact.  Acorn was MIA.  We <br/>
easily found the spot where it should have been by following the <br/>
beaten path to the hiding spot.  The same beaten path probably led <br/>
unscrupulous non-boxers to the same spot.  We'd also like to note <br/>
that the "lichen encrusted boulder" is hidden by overgrowth.  We only <br/>
found it on the second pass by looking very carefully.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, we headed for the very bottom of the state to collect <br/>
Gooseberry Island, Westport.  This was CSCM's 300th box.  If he <br/>
continues to box at his current pace, he will match Wanda's current <br/>
count in 22.5 years (by which time we figure Wanda will have found <br/>
around 25,500 boxes).<br/>
<br/>
Now we are very tired.<br/>
