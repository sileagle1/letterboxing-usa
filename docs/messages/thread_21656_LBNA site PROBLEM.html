Yep, MommaFox .. same problem here.  In fact, even if I click states I<br/>
have never been to that little green flag shows up next to boxes. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the hard work web-gurus, just reporting ... not<br/>
complaining.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

someone who has found a LOT of boxes.  I was going to change the<br/>
status, before I realized how many there were, but every time I do<br/>
that and go back to the previous page it won't let me get to that<br/>
