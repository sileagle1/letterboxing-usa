                    <div class="plaintext-content">with a week of wet weather, it has come to my attention that a number <br/>
of my boxes will be under water, as well as some of everyone elses. i <br/>
would like to just warn everyone who may venture into the northeast, <br/>
to prepare your self for lots of water.<br/>
<br/>
putting the boxes aside. uneksia is out in hillsboro and has been <br/>
victum of last falls flooding and i hope that she is safe and sound <br/>
out there and everything turns out better than it did late last year. <br/>
that also goes for anyone who happens to be located on or near a river.<br/>
<br/>
please be safe and use great boxing judgement<br/>
