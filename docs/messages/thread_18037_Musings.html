                    <div class="plaintext-content">There I was, relaxing, playing a good game of Freecell, pondering <br/>
that post about what a "poor stance" I had on the NPS.  I don't agree <br/>
with them--but it's a free country?  Why would my disagreeing upset <br/>
anyone?<br/>
<br/>
Then I realized it wasn't so much the disagreement, as my 'disregard' <br/>
of their rules and regulations.  Ahh, of course.  How insensitive of <br/>
me.  I don't get my way, so I (allegedly) do it my way anyway.  <br/>
Selfish snob that I am.<br/>
<br/>
But then I started pondering that.  Why does the thought of <br/>
flagrantly breaking the law not bother me?  I stopped hiding boxes in <br/>
National Parks because it was a hassle to maintain and difficult to <br/>
release clues that the NPS wouldn't read--not because I felt it was <br/>
ethically wrong of me to break their rules.  It's not even that I <br/>
think they are stupid rules, but rather narrow-minded and created <br/>
without any input from the people it would affect the most.<br/>
<br/>
They don't care about me, why should I care about them?<br/>
<br/>
Should I feel guilty?  *shrug*  What an interesting question....<br/>
<br/>
Some law-breakers have been hailed as heros for standing up against <br/>
unjustness.  The underground railroad comes to mind.  Brave <br/>
individuals saving blacks from slavery.  I doubt I'd have the courage <br/>
to do that myself--they had some pretty severe penalities for getting <br/>
caught.  Planting a box in a national park might get you a slap on <br/>
the wrist or a fine.<br/>
<br/>
Bad laws *should* be broken.  And the more people that do it, the <br/>
more the powers-that-be will have to listen.  Civil disobedience.<br/>
<br/>
Then my mind kind of wandered about the whole gay marriage thing in <br/>
the news recently.  What a box of worms that is.  I'll admit, I find <br/>
it enormously funny that so many people make such a big deal out of <br/>
it.  I can't really say I'm a big supporter of it, but I'm not an <br/>
opponent either.  Why do I give a hoot if two people want to get <br/>
married?  It's none of my business.  But it's so much fun to watch <br/>
the controversy.  "You'll rot in hell!"  "Does that mean I'll be <br/>
stuck with you for eternity?"  Both sides think they have the moral <br/>
high ground.<br/>
<br/>
I kind of feel sorry for the opponents, though.  It seems like a <br/>
losing battle.  Gay rights is moving on quite nicely.  The younger <br/>
folks are more tolerant of it than the older people who are more <br/>
likely to die off first.  A hundred years from now, they'll probably <br/>
look back and think what idiots we were arguing about something as <br/>
petty as the marriage between two people of the same sex.  A big <br/>
whoopy about nothing.<br/>
<br/>
But the opponents are still fighting against gay marriage as if they <br/>
could stop time.  It's rather valient, in a sense, to fight a losing <br/>
battle.  Although they probably don't realize the tide is against <br/>
them.  It might be years or even decades before gays have the same <br/>
rights as straights.  Certainly it'll go to the US Supreme Court <br/>
someday, and they'll find nothing in the US Constitution about <br/>
marriage being between a man and a woman.  Probably say something <br/>
like 'separate but equal didn't work with segregating blacks, and it <br/>
won't work with gays either.'<br/>
<br/>
It seems SO obvious to me that's what's going to happen.  You can <br/>
impeed progress, but it can't be stopped.  And neither can one stop <br/>
gay rights.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, by now, I'm seriously digressing from my initial <br/>
letterboxing thoughts.  Gay civil rights.  Black civil rights.  <br/>
Letterboxer civil rights.  Is there really a big difference between <br/>
them?  We all want to be treated like equals and get ticked when we <br/>
aren't.  And if you can't change anything through official channels, <br/>
is it really so wrong to press for your rights through civil <br/>
disobedience?<br/>
<br/>
I don't think so, but know others will probably disagree.  Which <br/>
they're free to do.  Thank God!<br/>
<br/>
Wow.  I need something less melodramatic to think about.<br/>

I feel that by preaching and inciting this manner of action you are putting the entire game at risk.  The Webmasters have been rightfully concerned in the past regarding the costs of defending themselves in a court action as a byblow of providing you ALL with some entertainment.  Please reconsider the unintended effect your actions might bring upon several families.  They never asked to be civil protagonists.<br/>

Actually, no, I think I covered that.  Something about "It could make <br/>
someone a criminal today, but a martyr tomorrow."<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The webmasters shouldn't be concerned that anything I say will cause <br/>
trouble for them.  For one thing, the "webmasters" are at Yahoo.  <br/>
LbNA does not run this talk list.  But even if it did, the people <br/>
that run the website cannot be held responsible for the content their <br/>
members put up.  The members who do something illegal are the ones <br/>
that will have to defend themselves in court.  And a discussion on <br/>
the legal and moral merits of civil disobedience, last I checked, <br/>
isn't illegal.  In fact, I was required to read about it in high <br/>
school once upon a time, so it can't be all that politically <br/>
incorrect nor illegal!<br/>
