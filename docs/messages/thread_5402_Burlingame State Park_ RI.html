to my girl scout troop this weekend.  We're going to be camping at<br/>
Burlingame State Park in RI this weekend and I wanted to try a box with<br/>
them.  I haven't been to any of the boxes in that area however, and I<br/>
was wondering if anybody could recommend one they've seen recently - I'd<br/>
hate to start the girls out with one we can't find.  Any suggestions<br/>
would be welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Hi Bridget,<br/>
<br/>
As far as we know most of the Charlestown, RI boxes are available with<br/>
the exception of the Kimball Arbutus pair which were removed by the<br/>
Audubon people (which is unfortunate as they were closest to the<br/>
campground), one of the Trustom Pond boxes, and one of the Ninigret<br/>
Pond boxes.  The Quest boxes are the oldest and were in need of repair<br/>
- haven't been to them lately.<br/>
<br/>
You might try the Great Gathering which was left by the Drew Clan<br/>
during  a letterboxers gathering at the Burlingame picnic area on the<br/>
east side of the lake.  It's a quick and easy start.  One of our boxes<br/>
is just a little north of there at the Schoolhouse Pond Preserve which<br/>
is a good area for children (mostly flat, open pine forest with no<br/>
apparent poison ivy).  It has a small parking lot off the main road. <br/>
Some of the other boxes are longer hikes including our Rhody Runaround<br/>
which is up to 8 miles if you do the whole loop.<br/>
