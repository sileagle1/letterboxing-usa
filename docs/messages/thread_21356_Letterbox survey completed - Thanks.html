Thank you to all of you who partipated in the survey I posted to test<br/>
its validity for use in my doctoral research on letterboxing.  I<br/>
received a tremendous and speedy response to my request for survey<br/>
participants.  Now I must review the survey and determine if it<br/>
obtains the information I hoped it would.  I will also look at how<br/>
long it took people to complete and the rate of those who began but<br/>
did not complete it for some reason.  This fall I will be launching<br/>
the updated version as I begin to collect data for the research. As<br/>
far as I can tell this is the first research study being conducted in<br/>
North America on letterboxing.  Louise Donovan is doing a bachelor's<br/>
research project in Wales on letterboxing.  Again, thanks for your<br/>
help. Happy trails to you all - watch this space for further updates.<br/>
