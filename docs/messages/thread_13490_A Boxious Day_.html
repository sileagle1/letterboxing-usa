                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well... the day started with five hours of work (ugh!!!  Can't wait until <br/>
School's OVER!)... then I decided to finish some of what I didn't get to do <br/>
yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
I started out by finding the complete Syt-ua-tion series... that pink trail <br/>
is hard to follow in one spot!  I went about 200 feet in the wrong direction <br/>
before I realized that I wasn't on the pink trail any longer!  <br/>
<br/>
I also drove out to a few places which will remain nameless and found <br/>
Freestone (Jay's Dilemma), Reach Out Hatchet, Uphill and Upstream, and Dragonfly and <br/>
Damselfly.  Upstream, my last box of the day, was my 699th!  Oy.... if I had <br/>
just found the other mystery box I was looking for........<br/>
<br/>
Only put about 150 miles on the car today.... between work and fun.... <br/>
(sigh...... I had better start saving up for a new car!).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Happy Hunting everyone!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That trail is indeed difficult to spot at points. Seems to be a newer <br/>
trail? So hopefully the increased foot traffic on the trail will wear <br/>
it in a bit.  Also, hopefully the next few days will dry that first <br/>
1/2 out...it was real wet when we placed...uh, yeah... a mysterious <br/>
box! (?)<br/>
