                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a little practical statistics exercise.<br/>
<br/>
By rough estimate, there is about 1 letterboxer per million people in <br/>
the US.  There are about 2 slipstick enthusiasts per million people <br/>
in the US.  <br/>
<br/>
Assuming independence (a very poor assumption) there is no reason to <br/>
believe that given random chance that there is any rational chance of <br/>
even one person being interested in letterboxing and slipsticks.  <br/>
(Actually the chance is on the order of 2 x 10^-12.)  I believe that <br/>
10^12 may be more people than have ever lived on earth.<br/>
<br/>
But statistics can be off by many orders of magnitude if the <br/>
conditions are not independent.  I have entered a poll to find out if <br/>
you had heard about slipsticks before I brought up the subject.<br/>

Sorry, TI55 ruled when I was in engineering school and I missed out <br/>
on that part of my education.  :-)<br/>

for those who enjoy letterboxing and either own or use<br/>
a slide rule. I still have my slide rule, I bring it<br/>
out and show it to my math students, who are amazed<br/>
that it actually works. They are spoiled with their <br/>
TI-83. It takes me longer to figure some problems out<br/>
on the calculator then doing it out long hand.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are many engineering  letterboxers, who<br/>
would be 40 or older, and have fond memories of slide<br/>
rules. I know I'm one. <br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmmm maybe I'll create my first box, keeping the<br/>
slide rule-slipstick in mind!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Boy! I am sure glad that I have the scientific background.  I was taught<br/>
Log and Trig tables in secondary school, bought a TI-81 in High School for<br/>
$120 (lots of dough back then to save up for), and in the end I am<br/>
extrememly happy I now use the Metric System.  It is so much<br/>
easier moving decimal places and converting rather than remembering<br/>
PSI:mmHg:foot/lb conversions.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I should throw out a box in which all the clues are conversions.<br/>
But I doubt it would get many visitors except for people sporting slip-sticks,<br/>
and comprehensive books of log tables/trig functions.<br/>
