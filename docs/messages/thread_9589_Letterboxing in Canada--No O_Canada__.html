<br/>
Buck&amp;Duck Master and I went to Old Montreal this week--had a great <br/>
time!! And while we were there of course we had to go letterboxing--<br/>
Unforunately "O' Canada" Letterbox was not there!! We hiked up Mount <br/>
Royal--What a grueling staircase-- but the view from the top was <br/>
outstanding--You could see all of Montreal and then some! <br/>
<br/>
I noticed on the clues sheet it said the box was missing as of July <br/>
2002, but it said it should be replaced in the Fall 2002--guess not!<br/>
Oh well it was a beatiful day only 28 degrees, but sunny! And the <br/>
squirrel's follwed us along the way --obviously they are some what <br/>
domesticated --and were looking for a hand out!  They were pretty <br/>
cute, but they lost interest in us when they realized were not going <br/>
to feed them.  What a great area in the midst of a large city!! <br/>
<br/>
I hope to get out letterboxing this week--I'm going thru withdrawal--<br/>
ha ha........ I think I'll try the 21 boxer---I figure if Chuck can <br/>
do it while in pain.. that I should be able to  : )  Irish Mum<br/>
