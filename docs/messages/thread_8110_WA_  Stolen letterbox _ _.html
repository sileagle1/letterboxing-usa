place.  I will work on replacing it soon.<br/>
<br/>
Question?  I will not re-hide the box in the same place because I'm <br/>
sure the juvenile delinquents will continue to steal it in the <br/>
future--since I will have to re-create a stamp (and it will, by <br/>
nature of my poor carving skills, be nothing similar to the first), <br/>
will the replacement box be considered a new Placed letterbox or <br/>
just a Replacement?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What makes you think it's a bunch of juvenile delinquents that stole <br/>
your box, and would steal it again and again?  Of all the boxes I've <br/>
placed that have gone missing, I've tried to replace them exactly as <br/>
before and they usually don't go missing again anytime soon.  Boxes <br/>
just go missing occasionally, and it's hard to tell exactly why.  <br/>
Maybe somebody took it thinking it was trash.  Maybe some <br/>
delinquents took it, but I doubt they'd go to the effort to continue <br/>
checking the spot in the hopes of being able to steal it again.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, to answer your question, though....  In my counting, I count it <br/>
as a new box if it's in a new location with a different stamp.  If <br/>
I "replace" a box in a new location (but has the same stamp), it's a <br/>
replacement.  If it's in the same place, with the same clues, but a <br/>
different stamp, it's a replacement.  And if it's in a different <br/>
place with a different stamp, it's a new box.  =)<br/>
<br/>
But that's just my opinion.  There aren't really any clear-cut rules <br/>
regarding the matter, and you can get a different opinion from every <br/>
person you ask.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The original location was under a bridge relatively close (approx <br/>
250m) to a major neighborhood.  The truant kids seem to hang out in <br/>
the area under the bridge and smoke/drink, etc. (as evidenced by <br/>
some of the trash under there).  It is a very historic area but they <br/>
don't seem to care.  I found a more secure location a few 100m away <br/>
that I don't think they'll be too interested in.  The other 2 boxes <br/>
in the series are absolutely fine, but then again, they aren't in an <br/>
area where those kids are likely to hang out.  Also, the box was <br/>
well marked all over the outside 'do not destroy' and 'do not <br/>
remove'.  It was labeled as a letterbox and there were copious <br/>
copies of info sheets explaining the hobby of letterboxing on the <br/>
inside.  But who knows?  Maybe a bear took it...  <br/>
