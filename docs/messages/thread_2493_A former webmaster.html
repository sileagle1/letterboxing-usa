Tell me about it Susan.  And tell Randy about it.  And Dan'l too for <br/>
that matter.  And I'm sure Mitch could contribute some insight as <br/>
well.  (With my apologies to the list:  this is personal, but I will <br/>
not stand by and allow someone to misrepresent what has happened <br/>

Agreed, especially if this list is expected to fund their <br/>
endeavours.  However, I would not hold out much hope that the <br/>
archives of the webmasters group would ever be made public.  But if <br/>
they were (in some sanitized version I'm sure), "founders", as they <br/>
like to call themselves, would simply go behind the scenes and start <br/>
a new behind-the-doors group as they have done in the past.<br/>

I applaud John for having the courage to address this issue openly as <br/>
a former webmaster. He certainly knows more about the behind the <br/>
scenes details than the rest of us. If Susan is going to imply the <br/>
problem is with John's temper, I suggest she open the archives and <br/>
let the rest of us see the evidence. There is no excuse for not doing <br/>
so except to hide the truth.<br/>

    Your temper is showing again.  Sorry that you seem to think all<br/>
people formerly or currently involved in the management of the site are<br/>
at odds.  If this were true, it would not have survived.  It has<br/>
survived and flourished as a non-commercial, non-profit, open access,<br/>
non-dues paying group.  Any family in any city in the USA can go down to<br/>
their public library and access clues for a non-exclusive, no-cost<br/>
outdoors expedition.  I think this is an amazing thing in today's world<br/>
and this is an aspect of the group worth preserving.<br/>

Susan, there's really no need for personal attacks.  Certainly not in <br/>
a public forum.<br/>

I have no idea what you base this generalization on.  I do stand by <br/>
my assertion that the people I mentioned in my earlier post have all <br/>
at one point or another been "at odds" with your group.  This does <br/>
not include all people.<br/>
<br/>

It has survived...<br/>
