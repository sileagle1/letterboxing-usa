                    <div class="plaintext-content">Letterboxing competitive? Really? That would mean I'm letterboxing for<br/>
all of you. I letterbox for my own enjoyment, why should I care about<br/>
what all of you are up to? Typical of the human animal though to make<br/>
everything about wining and conquering others. I remember a time when<br/>
most people on this list signed their posts with their PFX count.<br/>
Maybe that should be brought back then you can give everyone on this<br/>
list power over your self esteem...<br/>
<br/>
The question is not 'how many boxes did you find' or 'what box did you<br/>
find that no one else has found' but 'did you have fun finding them?'<br/>
The rest just gives others power over your own happiness. Leave the<br/>
playground mentality to the children and be responsible for your own<br/>
psyche.<br/>
