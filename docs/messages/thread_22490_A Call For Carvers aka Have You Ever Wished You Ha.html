<br/>
On September 17 and 18 we will be hosting a gathering, Boxtemberfest, <br/>
in western Colorado!  We are hoping that some of you will be inspired <br/>
to create a box and send it here to play with us!  I will find good <br/>
homes for all the boxes and keep a careful watch over them keeping <br/>
you updated in the process!<br/>
<br/>
The area we would like to populate is called Grand Mesa....a large <br/>
flat top mountain/extinct volcano covered with trails and lakes.  If <br/>
you have a very good imagination it can look like Mount Doom from <br/>
Lord of the Rings.  Only without the spewing lava, giant roving <br/>
eyeball or hordes of nasty orcses and Nazgul.  At this time The <br/>
Preciousss (Golum) has taken up a permanent home there after his <br/>
visit to the Monster Mash.  If you would like to answer the call of <br/>
the One Ring and create a Lord of the Rings themed box to join The <br/>
Precious on the mountain, please contact me off-list!  We would love <br/>
to have them!<br/>
<br/>
We'd also love to have any boxers who will be in the area that <br/>
weekend join us!<br/>
