<br/>
The area surrounding the Ohio Wolf Mystery box has been extensively littered<br/>
and vandalized.  I'd be hard pressed to find ANY flat rocks that do not<br/>
cover beer cans or broken glass.  Many rocks have apparently been tossed<br/>
downhill, as there are LOTS leaning heavily on trees towards the bottom.  I<br/>
found no less than 5 pieces of litter that could have been Tupperware in a<br/>
former life.  It appears that this area is home to after hours partying of<br/>
varying nature, and is rapidly degenerating.  Would not have wanted my son<br/>
with me yesterday, and I KNOW I walked those steps as a youngster, though<br/>
the play set is new.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to email lonemasswolf per the clue, but the email bounced.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any knowledge of this box, in terms of ownership, recent<br/>
sightings, etc., please email me at mailto:ranc0r@one.net.  If this one is<br/>
dead, let us put it to rest.  If not, then I'm off again!<br/>

Yeah, It's loanmasswolf's orphaned letterbox.<br/>
flyfisher and I (franzsolo...) have babied that box a little.<br/>
 flyfisher carved a replacement  stamp for it .and donated a tupperware<br/>
bowl to make it another complete L' box.<br/>
Maybe back in December of 2001. <br/>
But that stairway is very busy with little ones playing in the dirt on<br/>
the sides where that letterbox WAS<br/>
i would say a poor place for a letterbox..<br/>
So that's all I know.<br/>
