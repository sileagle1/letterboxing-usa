Warren County<br/>
Washington, New Jersey<br/>
<br/>
Planted July 1st 2001<br/>
<br/>
Directions: RT. 57 to Montana Road, after 2 miles, bear left at "Y" <br/>
intersection, .3 miles make left on Merrill Creek Rd., then turn right <br/>
towards Visitors Center.<br/>
<br/>
Pets are welcome on a leash.<br/>
<br/>
Terrain and Type: Easy<br/>
Time: If you hurry, about an hour, but take your time to explore...<br/>
Look for: Bald Eagles! A nesting pair call it home.<br/>
<br/>
"Foundations"<br/>
<br/>
Twin pines mark the trail head colored Black then Blue<br/>
Along to the waters expanse, pause, to reflect...<br/>
Up the hill into the past, these fields reborn to wood<br/>
"Y" ask?, Black and Blue...<br/>
Deeper in the young woods walk 'round<br/>
The path that lead to doors front and back<br/>
"Earl", not G.W. slept here, stones tumble down...<br/>
Then to the corner that remains straight and true<br/>
Catching the Sun where water sprang<br/>
To quench the thirst of folks and stock<br/>
Can you hear the sheep bleat and the horses stamp?<br/>
Breakfast is served by strong hands and hearts<br/>
That built this barn with rock and wood<br/>
Over the rail, through the door<br/>
Into the place where they once stood<br/>
Can you hear?<br/>
"Now!", over the wall as the veil thins...<br/>
To the monolith!<br/>
Soft trails lead to and to , fro and fro...<br/>
One to the trough where animals would go<br/>
Who and how many came to this place to replenish or refresh?<br/>
Your turn, those treasure bound!<br/>
Careful to the rear and ground...<br/>
<br/>
Past the Bank Barn where wagons rolled in full<br/>
Hay and grain for winters long days<br/>
Stored with Tenant help<br/>
"Yellow" the leaves turned in fall<br/>
The Shafer's lived here too...<br/>
Stone is all that lasts, and even that wears in time<br/>
"Red" the Sun sets on this tale...<br/>
A wall through time past and present<br/>
Two not one<br/>
See! a tree has grown where walls stood solid<br/>
Holy! Holy! Holy!<br/>
Again a break, and pines straight<br/>
To the open sky, right or left?<br/>
You decide.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!!<br/>
Floating Feather<br/>
