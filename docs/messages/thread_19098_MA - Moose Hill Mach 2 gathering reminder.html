<br/>
This is just a reminder that the second annual gathering at Moose Hill <br/>
Wildlife Sanctuary is fast approaching.<br/>
<br/>
We will be gathering at the nature center (hopefully outdoors under the <br/>
canopies in the summer camp yard) of the Moose Hill Wildlife Sanctuary in Sharon, <br/>
MA on Sunday, June 27 from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. (For those who missed the original <br/>
post, I have copied it below).<br/>
<br/>
We have heard from a few folks that have RSVP'd  but we're hoping we'll see <br/>
lots of friends, old and new. Since the Sanctuary is not charging us to use the <br/>
site, I am suggesting that folks consider making a donation to the sanctuary <br/>
in consideration. They are advertising the event in their newsletter, so we <br/>
may have some new faces to welcome to our growing family.<br/>
<br/>
As usual the event is potluck. CSCM and I will provide soft drinks.<br/>
<br/>
I will carve an event stamp, but any others are most welcome. <br/>
<br/>
Since the hitchhiker exchange worked so well at the last event we attended, <br/>
we will set up a similar exchange (The rule is that you may only take a HH from <br/>
the exchange box if you have brought a HH to add to the exchange. This should <br/>
avoid the time consuming stamping frenzy that many people dislike).<br/>
<br/>
The sanctuary does not allow dogs (sorry), and the town of Sharon does not <br/>
allow public smoking (yes, believe it or not, it's true!).<br/>
Despite that, we hope to see you all in a couple of weeks. :-)<br/>
<br/>
To get directions to the sanctuary, you can go to <br/>
http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Moose_Hill/index.php<br/>
<br/>
You can also contact me or CSCM if you have any questions. (For anyone coming <br/>
from a distance, we can recommend very reasonable accomodations nearby).<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
<br/>

&lt;<come all!="" come="" hill="" in="" ma="" moose="" on<br="" one!="" sanctuary="" sharon,="" the="" to="" wildlife="">
Sunday, June 27 from 1 p.m. - 5 p.m. for the second annual Moose Hill <br/>
Gathering!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are hoping to see some familiar faces and perhaps welcome some new folks<br/>
(as the nature center has put this in their program bulletin). This time we<br/>
hope for a lovely day and to be able to use the picnic tables outdoors. Last<br/>
year<br/>
we fit 80 of us into the nature center on that bitterly cold January day<br/>
(shiver!).<br/>
<br/>
The potluck nature of these events always leaves us with tons of food, so<br/>
CSCM and I will provide cold drinks and leave the rest to fate. I will carve <br/>
an<br/>
<br/>
event stamp, but others are welcome to carve too. There are several boxes on<br/>
the sanctuary, but I'm sure there will be some event-only boxes as well. Let <br/>
us<br/>
know if you are able to come by RSVP'ing.<br/>
<br/>
See you there!!<br/>
