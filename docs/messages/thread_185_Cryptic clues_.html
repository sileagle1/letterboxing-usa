<br/>
I would stay away from clues that are too cryptic, esp. if you are going<br/>
to plug the letterbox<br/>
in the ground.  You will need to get them to an exact location.  Also,<br/>
its no fun to have been<br/>
lead on a wild goose chase, to have expended a great deal of energy<br/>
seeking out a location<br/>
and come up with nothing.  Its true that the hunt is a big part of the<br/>
fun, but its no fun at all to<br/>
not find anything in the end.<br/>
<br/>
If you're worried about making it too easy for vandals you can<br/>
accomplish the same thing by<br/>
having exacting clues that are very involved.  For example see<br/>
<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/sewanee.htm<br/>
<br/>
This would take the same length of time as clues that are cryptic.  But<br/>
the difference is in<br/>
the end you will find your prize with these clues.  It is no more likely<br/>
that a vandal will go<br/>
through the trouble of of finding a box with involved clues like these<br/>
than it would be for<br/>
a vandal to go through the trouble of finding a box with cryptic clues.<br/>
<br/>
And there are lots of other solutions to keep vandals away that will not<br/>
frustrate legitimate<br/>
seekers.  You want to keep the crooks away, true, but you want to allow<br/>
discovery too.<br/>
There's no point if you don't allow discovery for people who are willing<br/>
to follow your<br/>
clues.  It IS the whole point of providing a letterbox:  To make it so<br/>
people who are willing<br/>
to follow the clues can find it.<br/>
<br/>
One solution is the well hidden box.  We already discussed this.  The<br/>
idea is to avoid<br/>
accidental dioscovery as has happened with a few of our boxes already.<br/>
So make sure<br/>
that in order to find the box you MUST have clues.<br/>
<br/>
Another solution is to NOT put the box way out in the boonies where it<br/>
is easy for would-be<br/>
vandals to hide their activities.  I suppose if it is WAY out there that<br/>
will dissuade a lot of<br/>
vandals.  Problem is it will probably dissuade legitimate seekers too.<br/>
And worse than that<br/>
it will provide a nice hiding place for the crook to conceal his or her<br/>
activities.<br/>
<br/>
Some alternative hiding places are: Letterbooks at local libraries &amp;<br/>
bookstores, Pubs, or even<br/>
the end of your driveway.  Also, I'm thinking of Rachaels first box.  It<br/>
was by a boat launch,<br/>
probably not a very remote place.  Crooks don't like to be seen.  They<br/>
will tend not to hang<br/>
out where their activities can be noticed.  Remember, crooks do things<br/>
in hiding (in the dark,<br/>
so to speak), so keep everything out in the open as far as possible.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was Trevor Dallas (from Dartmoor) who shared that the worst<br/>
thing for a letterboxer<br/>
is to spend hours looking for a letterbox only to not find it.  I think<br/>
it would be even more<br/>
disheartening for some of our letterboxers because they will have to<br/>
drive to a place to find<br/>
some of our letterboxes.  Who wants to drive for 2 hours and then come<br/>
up dry?<br/>
<br/>
So I would steer clear of clues that are too cryptic.  If they are<br/>
cryptic enough to dissuade<br/>
crooks they will dissuade legitimate seekers too.<br/>
<br/>
The Fallacy that Maps make it too easy:<br/>
<br/>
Even having a nice map and compass bearings will not guarantee finding a<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
The GPS coordinates and the point on our maps are only accurate to about<br/>
300 feet.  It<br/>
does NOT give away the box location.  When you take into acoount the<br/>
scaling factor of the<br/>
map it becomes even less likely that you will locate the letterbox from<br/>
the map.  The dot<br/>
on the map that represents the location is itself about 200 yards across<br/>
when you take into<br/>
account the scaling factor.  No, the maps are primarily tools to allow<br/>
people to get started.<br/>
They provide nothing for vandals that vandals would not be able to<br/>
discover by some<br/>
other means.  But they are nice for a muiltitude of other reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Even compass bearings can be obscure and inexact for people seeking a<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
You can have several objects on one line with a compass bearing.  Just<br/>
providing a map<br/>
and a bearing is NOT a giveaway.  Even 2 bearings is not a giveaway.<br/>
You have to<br/>
have at least 3 bearings to tie down a location.  This can be<br/>
mathematically proven.<br/>
So our problem is not that we are too exacting with our clues.  It is<br/>
that we are not<br/>
being clear enough.<br/>
<br/>
One more point:  Cryptic clues do nothing for children.  The fun for<br/>
them will be in learning<br/>
to seek something out that has guides and certain rules about it.  Kids<br/>
like guidance and<br/>
direction.  Its part of the learning process and part of the fun for<br/>
them.<br/>
Cryptic clues will turn off most adults and probably make it impossible<br/>
for the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I think we have to accept the risk involved.  If you provide a certain<br/>
way to find the box<br/>
you are opening the door to vandalism.  But as of yet we have only<br/>
explored a few of<br/>
the other possible ways to limit vandalism - ways that will not make the<br/>
seeking of a<br/>
letterbox cryptic or inordinately difficult.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the best ways to do this is to keep your letterboxes out<br/>
in the open where<br/>
they are visible to people.  Or, alternately, keep them inside an<br/>
establishment (library,<br/>
bookstore, etc.) where thy can be guarded by people.  But these are only<br/>
a couple of<br/>
ideas.  I'm sure there are many more than these if you think about it.<br/>
<br/>
Let's explore some of the other possible ways to solve this problem.<br/>
Maybe we should<br/>
put some boxes out in some of these alternative ways.  Bear in mind that<br/>
we are not on the<br/>
moor.  Most of us are urban dwellers.  That itself will put a different<br/>
characteristic into<br/>
USA letterboxing.<br/>

no way.... I'm going to start placing boxes that are SO hard to find<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, maybe I should clarify a little bit.  I don't intend to make clues so<br/>
difficult or cryptic that you can't find the box, but I'm starting to<br/>
appreciate that the hunt (and in the box placer's case the hiding) is a lot<br/>
of the fun.  The few boxes that I've placed so far have clues that only<br/>
require taking a couple of compass bearings.  You could probably find Mt.<br/>
Minsi without a compass because of the landmarks that I mention in the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm considering just making it a little more challenging (maybe<br/>
cryptic wasn't the right word), and perhaps a little more leaning toward<br/>
orienteering.  In addition, the boxes that I've placed (and will likely<br/>
place in the future) aren't really geared toward little kids, so I think<br/>
they could be a little more challenging.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which...another box should be finding a home this weekend if<br/>
all goes well!<br/>
