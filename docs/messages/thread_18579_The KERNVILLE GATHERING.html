fantastic gathering this weekend in Kernville.  The weather was <br/>
perfect, and you could not find two more gracious hosts.  Ten <br/>
letterboxes were hidden for the event, and some of those clues were <br/>
wicked smart.  Instead of holding the event in a park, the whole city <br/>
of Kernville was our playground, and stamps were planted all over <br/>
town.  Besides the event stamps, the whole Kernville area is a hotbed <br/>
of California letterboxing activity, thanks to Don &amp; Gwen.  This <br/>
small town rivals San Luis Obispo and Los Angeles for boxes, and also <br/>
thanks to Don, the carving is excellent.  I wonder if there's another <br/>
stamp out there that is accessed by white-water rafting?  My count <br/>
for the weekend is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
April 23rd: <br/>
"The Troll of Kernville" (Black Widow spider encounter while stamping <br/>
in at the river's edge; fortunately for me, the spider came out the <br/>
worse for this fight.)<br/>
"The Cannell Quail"<br/>
"The Babe Lure"<br/>
"The Alten Wedding Bells"<br/>
"The Love Birds of Bull Run"<br/>
"Mailbox" (Which I picked up at 11:00 PM at night, after having <br/>
dinner with D&amp;G. Don assured me that the police are asleep at that <br/>
hour, so I didn't need to worry about being picked up walking around <br/>
town with a flashlight--Kernville is not Los Angeles.)<br/>
<br/>
April 24th (Gathering Day!!):<br/>
"Bob Powers: Kernville Country Classic"<br/>
"Cadence and Carson Seekin' Smokey"<br/>
"Western Welcome" (I dropped the "Arizona Vacation" hitchhiker in <br/>
this box, which was given to be by Emma B. at the SoCal Mini-Meet the <br/>
week before.  It was picked up later in the day by another Gathering <br/>
attendee.)<br/>
"Just Enough Bull"<br/>
"White Water--Not" (With Don in command, we white-water rafted to <br/>
this site.)<br/>
"Silent Doug's Car Key" Hitchhiker<br/>
"River Statistic"<br/>
"Kernville Retrieve"<br/>
"Sign Bite" (After a chance meeting in town [well, the town isn't <br/>
that big, so there's a great chance for a chance meeting], Sierra <br/>
Sally and I went searching for this box together. Access to this box <br/>
is closed after 4 PM, and we got to the location well after closing <br/>
time, but a friendly attendant at this facility saw us wandering <br/>
around the parking lot and asked if we needed help [don't you just <br/>
love small towns].  Well, we spilled our guts [I think I'm the one <br/>
that started the spilling, but Sierra took up the gut-spilling <br/>
immediately], and told the attendant we were after a letterbox, so he <br/>
let us in after hours.)<br/>
"Mad Dawg"<br/>
"New Gold Strike"<br/>
"Bubble's Beach Beaver" (Scorpion encounter; kids, be like the <br/>
Buzzard, always wear gloves when reaching into dark holes.)<br/>
"Buzzard's Perch" (I was late to dinner at D&amp;Gs house because I just <br/>
had to find this one.)<br/>
"Peace Meltdown" Hitchhiker<br/>
"Ralph the Hitchhiking Letterbox" Hitchhiker<br/>
<br/>
That makes a grand total of 18 letterboxes and 3 Hitchhikers, which I <br/>
count as finds, for a total of 21.  I also placed two letterboxes <br/>
(clues to follow).  Thanks Don &amp; Gwen for a great party!!<br/>
<br/>
P.S. If you're listening Silent Doug, check to make sure you have <br/>
your keys.<br/>
