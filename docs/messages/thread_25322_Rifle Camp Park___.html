It was my third found box.  That same day I planted my first letterbox, Heartbeat Road.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've replaced the box after having dried out the logbook and created a felt pocket for the stamp. To future seekers of this box, the "Hollow half tree" is more like a pile of rotting wood right now.  It was somewhat standing when I pulled the box, but it has since fallen (or been kicked) to pieces.  I walked past it four times before I was able to relocate it to put the box back.<br/>
