&gt; Please, when you are leaving a letterbox, try to leave it in BETTER <br/>
&gt; condition than when you found it. Please Double Bag the paper items <br/>
&gt; at the very least (when the ziplock bags are available for it).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the reminder, Amanda. I happen to have a variety of plastic ziplocks in <br/>
different sizes. Often, I use a smaller one for the stamp so that it can't be mistaken for <br/>
the logbook baggie. Then I bag the book with two bigger ones. I usually carry an <br/>
assortment with me in my letteboxing kit. <br/>
<br/>
&gt;  If you found the box and you saw some plastic shining in the sun. You <br/>
&gt; should replace the box so that NO PLASTIC is exposed. If you noticed <br/>
&gt; the tell-tale sign of a row of strategically placed sticks. You <br/>
&gt; should try to camouflage the sticks by tossing some leaves or duff <br/>
&gt; onto the pile.<br/>
<br/>
Those tell-tale signs are like a beacon in the woods, a flashing light saying, "Hi, I'm <br/>
manmade... please come explore me!" I figure that a lot of letterboxes go missing for <br/>
just this reason. I'm such a freak for leaving the area looking natural, that I often will <br/>
"sweep" the area with a stick to remove footprints or disturbed earth before I move on. <br/>
