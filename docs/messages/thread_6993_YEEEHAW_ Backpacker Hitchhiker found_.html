                    <div class="plaintext-content">YAY! My first hitchhiker I've found in a box (Mohmers mailed one to <br/>
me last year, so that doesn't count...)! Teddy and I were doing box <br/>
maintenance tonight and we stopped at Fox in Box (doing fine!) and <br/>
discovered Backpacker snuggled in the same spot! Tomorrow Backpacker <br/>
will be on his way, and so will a couple more hitchhikers, including <br/>
the one Mohmers sent me.<br/>
<br/>
Teddy and I will be placing a series of boxes in Crosswinds Marsh, <br/>
just south of Belleville, Michigan. Tomorrow we'll probably get only <br/>
two or three placed, but I'll post whatever we accomplish. We also <br/>
plan to raid the wild black raspberry bushes nearby...pie, anyone???<br/>
