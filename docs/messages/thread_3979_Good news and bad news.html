&lt;&lt; Found this one [Farmington River Rail Trail Letterbox in Canton, CT] <br/>
today. Surprisingly, I was the first one in it. I thought our friend from <br/>
Axtown would have been right there. It was in good shape.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ironic, isn't it? I haven't yet looked for the very letterbox that's closest <br/>
to my Axtown abode. In fact, I decided to postpone my search for it until <br/>
later this winter, when the weather precludes traveling greater distances or <br/>
digging too deeply in snow for boxes. However, I was surprised to read that <br/>
you were the first one to stamp in. Shortly after the box was planted, my <br/>
good friend Sugarmaker found it, and he was followed in short order by ESAK. <br/>
Hmmm, quite the mystery!<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I myself have been venturing far afield during December, <br/>
pursuing various letterboxes while the winter weather - though cold and crisp <br/>
- remains otherwise hospitable for the hunt. The Collinsville Crew spent a <br/>
Sunday afternoon early in the month following in the footsteps of Harry, Ron <br/>
and Hemione in the Drewclan's wonderful Harry Potter series of letterboxes. <br/>
Except for Griffindor Tower (which we believe is missing or perhaps has been <br/>
made invisible), all of the four remaining boxes are intact. The Drewclan's <br/>
hand-carved stamps really capture the spirit of the story!<br/>
<br/>
After having been put in the employ of Max Q. (of Dan and Melissa fame), I <br/>
next pursued an escaped prisoner from nearby Old New-Gate prison a week or so <br/>
later. With a little bit of assistance from members of the Bonnie and Clyde <br/>
gang - whom I met along the trails - I managed to find all four of the boxes <br/>
in this series, although the prisoner himself appears to have evaded my <br/>
capture and fled north into Massachusetts. This is another excellent hike, <br/>
and the hand-carved stamps are especially eye-catching.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I made my way this past Sunday afternoon to Glastonbury, where I <br/>
found the Varrell family's two Santa's Playground letterboxes at J. B. <br/>
Williams Park and their Picnic Boulder letterbox along the Shenipsit Trail. <br/>
Much to my surprise (not!), at this last box I had been preceded first by <br/>
Wanda and Pete and then by Dan and Melissa. Maybe they really *are* different <br/>
couples...or maybe not! Alas, I was much less successful at the South <br/>
Glastonbury ferry landing, where - despite the seemingly simple clues - the <br/>
Ferry Flit box eluded me completely (aren't those always the hardest to <br/>
find?). <br/>
<br/>
Pat Koss continued:<br/>
&lt;<then <br="" farmington="" give="" greenway="" i="" north="" simsbury="" the="" to="" valley="" went="">
another try. I found the box, but it was empty except for a pencil. My <br/>
husband suggested that putting it along the path rather than at the end where <br/>
it looks like beer drinking youths congregate would be better. Sorry to have <br/>
to be the bearer of bad news again. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ouch! That's the second time in three months a letterbox has disappeared from <br/>
this location...definitely a problematic place. When I went looking in late <br/>
October, that box was there, having just been replaced by Bill Haalck after <br/>
the first box went missing. The second hiding place was more covert than the <br/>
first, but apparently beer-drinking youths will not be denied.<br/>
<br/>
Happy holidays to all!<br/>

    Alan,<br/>
        We went to Santa's Playground as our last stop of the day where we<br/>
saw that you had stamped in only an hour or so before us!!  We really<br/>
enjoyed that hike, especially the part where we bushwacked through the baby<br/>
white pines.  We also had trouble finding the Ferry Flit box, it took us<br/>
quite a bit longer than 15 minutes, but when we did find it, it was exactly<br/>
where it should have been.  We were just complicating things be overthinking<br/>
the clues, but it is there and has had 2 sets of visitors.<br/>
    We are glad to hear that you enjoyed Max's quest!  Molly told me that<br/>
she saw you on her hike!<br/>
<br/>
    Have a Merry Christmas!<br/>
<br/>
Melissa and Max<br/>
