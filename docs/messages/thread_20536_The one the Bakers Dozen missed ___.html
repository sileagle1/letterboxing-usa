                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi to all of the dozen,<br/>
I refer, of course, to the last letterbox that was found on Sunday before lunch !!!!<br/>
Okay, allow me to refresh your memories.........beware of snakes was the name of the box and as I'm sure you all remember your prestigeous leader - one Mark Pepe - bestowed upon me the honour of opening the bonus box that was inside !! See, you all remember it know ! LOL<br/>
Little did i know that the box actually contained a spring loaded snake!!! The rest you can all figure out for yourselves, suffice to say i did not wear the same trousers on Monday !!<br/>
Well the bonus box actually refered to a bonus stamp that i am now in possession of ( haha last laugh is with me ), and as the Bakers Dozen were all present, you are all entitled to a copy.<br/>
<br/>
So, when the apology for my trousers, and the dry cleaning bill, have been taken care of I shall forward a copy of the stamp.LOL<br/>
<br/>
On a more serious note I would like to thank you all for a fantastic two days and should you feel the need to venture onto the moor again then let me know.  I shall be putting a small writr up on the MSN group in the near future and will let you all know when it is done.<br/>
<br/>
I shall forward a copy of the bonus stamp to Mark so that he can distribute it amongst the group.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again guys<br/>

I hate it when the last laugh is on us! I thought we Yanks got the last laugh with the Tea Party!!!<br/>
<br/>
Sending the stamp's image via email will be fine. I'll print it out on some label stock I have and distribute it to those Baker's Dozen members that come to the Monster Mash on this coming Saturday. Also - email the dry cleaning bill, too! <br/>
<br/>
Let me take this opportunity to publicly thank you for the generosity of your time which you spent with us last week. I am continually amazed at the kindness of strangers, like you, the Donovans and the Spannerman clan, that we met across the pond - strangers that quickly became family. I guess the love of letterboxing unites us all - no matter in which country we reside.<br/>
<br/>
Despite our constant kidding and teasing, you are one special person. You can rest assured that whenever we return, hopefully in 3 years, you will be one of the first we call.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for giving so much of yourself to make this a memorable vacation for us all!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
