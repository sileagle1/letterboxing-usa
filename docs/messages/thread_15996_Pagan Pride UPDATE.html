&gt; find I Think I can, I know I can because we weren't<br/>
&gt; prepared for a long <br/>
&gt; hike. It was a hot day and we just wanted to get a<br/>
&gt; few boxes that were short <br/>
&gt; hikes. We plan to go back there and find it soon.<br/>
<br/>
That clue is in the Pagan Pride Box. And I'm going to<br/>
take this opportunity to announce the immienent change<br/>
of this box.<br/>
<br/>
On Oct. 5, 2003, at Strathmore Park in Russel MA, the<br/>
previous Pagan Pride 2002 Box will be retired, and<br/>
replaced by the Pagan Pride 2003 Box. The box will<br/>
have a new stamp, and a new hiding place. The logbook<br/>
will not be changed. For those who want to get the old<br/>
stamp before it is retired, consider yourself warned.<br/>
Also, for those of you that want the new stamp, and<br/>
might not have the old one yet, I am going to make<br/>
both the new stamp and the old stamp available during<br/>
Pagan Pride Day, in the Community Center. Entrance to<br/>
the event is a canned or boxed good for donation to<br/>
the Western Mass Food Bank. The grounds open at 11,<br/>
and events are planned all day through 8PM. For more<br/>
information on the event itself, please go to<br/>
http://www.sismoon.com/paganpride.htm<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, I will be carrying my personal traveller<br/>
with me that day, so come and find me on the grounds.<br/>
Hope y'all will come. :-)<br/>
<br/>
