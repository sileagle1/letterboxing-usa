Have I got a treat for you!- just be sure to bring your bug <br/>
repellent!! Located in beautiful and historic Huntington Beach State <br/>
Park just a dozen or so miles from Myrtle Beach there are more things <br/>
to do here than I care to list. The park itself is sooo beautiful and <br/>
its practically across the street from Brookgreen Gardens (don't GET <br/>
me started on them!)In addition to your stamp, pack binoculars for up-<br/>
close views of alligators, exotic birds and more PLUS your camera for <br/>
the fantastic coastal scenes AND (it just gets better..) your <br/>
appetite since there are scores of delectible restuarants awaiting <br/>
you in Murrels Inlet. (3 miles) I hope you'll use this letterbox as <br/>
an excuse to come to this area and have fun. Its called "The Best <br/>
Things..." letterbox and you'll find out why.  Here's the details:<br/>
<br/>
"The Best Things..." letterbox<br/>
Planted Oct. 19,2002<br/>
Where: Huntington Beach State Park (just SW of Murrels Inlet, SC)<br/>
Difficulty: Easy (less than one mile round trip through forested <br/>
terrain.  <br/>
Directions: Park at the "Education Center" parking lot.  Cross road <br/>
to "Sandpiper Pond Trail" (more prominently called simply "Nature <br/>
Trail" (as misnomer to be sure).  At all intersections BEAR RIGHT.  <br/>
COUNT EACH RED TOPPED post you pass.  You'll cross a boardwalk along <br/>
the way and just past the FIFTH RED POST you'll find the stairs to <br/>
nowhere (literally!) Standing on the lowest step look to your right <br/>
for a stump approx. 45 feet away. Use caution reaching in for the <br/>
letterbox - could be ANYTHING IN THERE waitin' to chomp on YOU! <br/>
ENJOY - its "The Best Things..."<br/>
