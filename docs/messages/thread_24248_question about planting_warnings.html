 Subject: [LbNA] question about planting/warnings<br/>
<br/>
     I have a question about planting. I'm in process of planting a <br/>
 series of boxes in local cemeteries. There's a cemetery that I want <br/>
 to use that I think would be perfect. But, a friend of mine is a <br/>
 county deputy sheriff and one of her co-deps told her that they often <br/>
 bust people in there for various delinquent activities (drugs, <br/>
 etc). I've been through there several times in the past few weeks <br/>
 and have never seen anyone in there, much less people doing these <br/>
 things. This isn't a highly dangerous/super high crime area. I <br/>
 think if people go there during the day and use common sense, they <br/>
 would be safe enough in there. It may not be a great idea to go a <br/>
 night (I'm not sure if they lock the gates at night here like most seem to do).<br/>
<br/>
 I have a very specific idea of the kind of cemetery I'm looking for <br/>
 and I'm having a much harder time finding planting sites than I <br/>
 thought I would. This one is perfect in all other aspects , so I <br/>
 really want to plant a box in there.<br/>

 My question is, should I:<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the reply, Lady Prisspott.  My question really isn't about whether or not I should plant a box in a cemetery.  I don't want to get into that issue. What I'm really looking for is advice on whether I should plant a box in an area were there may or may not be the potential for run-ins with criminal activity.  I've never seen anything shady there, but have heard if happenings.  I just want to know if I should let people know to be extra cautious, not plant there at all or plant and leave them to their own common sense.<br/>
<br/>
  So, I'm revising my question...<br/>
  Would you plant a box ANYWHERE where there may be a potentially dangerous enviornment?  And if you would, would you put a an additional "be safe" type warning in your clues, or not mention it and assume people read the disclaimers and warnings posted on LBNA/AQ?<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks,<br/>

*********************************************<br/>
<br/>
Here's how I see it:<br/>
<br/>
Anytime we as boxers go after a box, we are left to our own common sense;<br/>
HOWEVER, if the placer knows something about a location that should be told,<br/>
they have a responsibility to tell it.<br/>
<br/>
When we are out boxing, things change and we have to evaluate the situation<br/>
on a given day.  As an example, a box that might be perfectly safe on a dry<br/>
day may be dangerous to reach on a rainy day when the nearby creek is<br/>
rising.  A finder can't expect the placer to tell EVERYTHING that might<br/>
possibly happen, so we have to keep our own eyes open.<br/>
<br/>
I have two boxes that come to my mind in terms of including warnings for<br/>
finders.  Both are great locations and somewhere I wanted to take the<br/>
finder.  One of them is definitely a daytime box only though, and I mention<br/>
that in my clues.  Another is placed in an area where there are known to be<br/>
alligators so I caution the finder about small animals and children near the<br/>
water.  In either of these places, the risk is not immediately recognizable,<br/>
but it is there and I don't want my box to be the reason someone's family<br/>
pet gets chomped up for alligator appetizer.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't worry about mentioning standard hazards though, or highly<br/>
unlikely risks.  As an example, warning finders about poison ivy near boxes<br/>
in Texas is like telling someone not to dive headfirst into shallow water.<br/>
If the finder doesn't have the common sense to know that anytime you aren't<br/>
standing on concrete in Texas in the summertime you are very likely standing<br/>
near PI, then maybe a good case of itch will solve that problem.<br/>
<br/>
If the risk you are aware of is not immediately recognizable, you should<br/>
probably mention it.  We all appreciate a heads-up, but none of us needs a<br/>
mother - I hit the trail to get away from mine (j/k Mom!).<br/>

What I hear you saying is that, regardless of any opinions that have<br/>
been expressed about the impropriety of planting a letterbox on<br/>
private, hallowed ground, you intend to plant there and your only<br/>
concern is safety of those seeking the box. Given your determination<br/>
to plant would the opinion that the safety concerns should preclude<br/>
you from planting there sway you?<br/>
<br/>
It seems axiomatic that if there's enough concern to ask other's<br/>
opinion that you would simply choose another spot. With 196,940,400<br/>
square miles of land surface on Earth I think there are plenty of<br/>
other places (excluding Connecticut of course) to plant; or are you<br/>
asking for validation of your a priori decision to plant in this<br/>
particular cemetery?<br/>

You seem to have read a lot more into my email than I actually <br/>
wrote.   I asked a very general question that had actually nothing to <br/>
do with the plant site being a cemetery:  "If there was a potential <br/>

if you'd plant, would you add a warning?"   The danger could be <br/>
anything from delinquents, alligators, steep one-way only roads, <br/>

<br/>
I was not seeking validation or approval to plant this box in this <br/>

may be 196,940,400 square miles of land on the earth, there are only <br/>
about 10 square miles of actual land that are available to me that <br/>
meet my requirements (and that estimate is exceedingly generous, I believe).<br/>
<br/>
As I said before, I do not desire to open the whole cemetery debate <br/>
again.  As it happens, this is NOT a privately owned piece of <br/>
land.  I wouldn't plant on private-owned property without out <br/>
permission.  As I gather from your email, you seem to have a <br/>
deep-felt negative opinion of 'boxing in cemeteries regardless of any <br/>
other circumstances.  That is certainly your prerogative and I can <br/>
respect that.   If you find it disrespectful to the deceased or to be <br/>
a desecration of the land, there's no reason you have to plant or <br/>
seek boxes in cemeteries.  But, not everyone will hold the same <br/>
opinion.  Hopefully, you can respect that.  I think that visiting <br/>
cemeteries is very interesting and educational.  I think it's a <br/>
wonderful way to remember our past, honor and remember our ancestors, <br/>
even if they are people we've never met.  My intent with this series <br/>
is only to share my interest in this regard with other people.  I do <br/>
not believe that I'm dishonoring, disturbing or destroying any of the <br/>
cemeteries or people buried in them with this endeavor.  That said, <br/>
I'm sure there are other people that will feel it's improper and will <br/>

went to find a box in one this past weekend. It was a huge old cemetery.<br/>
The girls asked lots of questions about the stones and were amazed by<br/>
the size, color, shapes, names, etc... We have a little family cemetery<br/>
and that is the only one the girls had been in before. They were<br/>
'scared' at first, walking around the 'dead people', but after a few<br/>
minutes they were over that and they have a new 'view' of, and respect<br/>
for, cemeteries. To me visiting a cemetery is like visiting a museum or<br/>
art gallery, except you get history, art, AND get to be in the beautiful<br/>
outdoors. :)<br/>

As it happens Her Ladyship is merely puzzled by the fascination with<br/>
planting in cemeteries. While her Ladyship finds the study of history<br/>
fascinating her Ladyship doesn't find a need to combine it with<br/>
letterboxing. It is also the case that some find cemeteries to be<br/>
places where one's conduct should honor the memory of those interred.<br/>
It's easy to see how these persons could find the exercise of what<br/>
they would probably construe as a frivolous hobby to be disrespectful<br/>
when carried out on consecrated ground. Considering these two facts<br/>
leads her Ladyship to conclude; "why bother"? Coming from this point<br/>
of view and considering your concerns about safety it simply seems<br/>
illogical to insist on planting in this cemetery but I have no<br/>
delusions of being the letterboxing police, you obviously will<br/>
exercise your own reasoning and do as you see fit.<br/>
<br/>
Her Ladyship is also frustrated with the infantilization of American<br/>
society and the development of the "Nanny State". The American public<br/>
seems to feel that it is a duty of the State to protect us from, and<br/>
indemnify us against, all harm. We have become children who expect the<br/>
State to act as our constant protector leading to a diffusion of<br/>
responsibility for our own actions and choices outward and ultimately<br/>
to the State. Your question seems an example of this. You state that<br/>
your concern is based on hearsay yet you seem to sense that you will<br/>
be held responsible if an autonomous adult engaged in the exercise of<br/>
free will enters, of their own volition, a situation which could be<br/>
dangerous. This notion is apparently so inculcated that you are<br/>
concerned merely on the suggestion of risk, not even on the first hand<br/>
observation of dangerous activity at the subject location. Americans<br/>
needs to grow up and realize that being an adult with a free will<br/>
carries risks and though this may seem unpleasant or unfair that the<br/>
blessings of liberty and free choice are far greater than the slight<br/>
risks we must accept. Of course there is always someone ready with an<br/>
anecdote about some one who was injured through some one else's<br/>
negligence as if one incidence should absolve each and every<br/>
individual of responsibility for their choices. It's the same<br/>
reasoning that fills states coffers with cash from lotteries. "Someone<br/>
has to win" the rationale goes. This is woefully wrong. Someone<br/>
eventually wins when the numbers of people playing reaches the level<br/>
of the odds. If a billion tickets are sold then it is statistically<br/>
probable that at least one person will have their numbers drawn<br/>
despite the billion to one odds that their specific set of numbers<br/>
will be drawn. Equivalently, one negative outcome of the exercise of<br/>
choice out of the inestimably large number of choices that the<br/>
billions of people on the planet make every day does not constitute<br/>
evidence of impending doom for anyone who dares to make a choice.<br/>
Given that you have no first hand knowledge of risk her Ladyship would<br/>
say let adults act like adults who should be capable of deciding for<br/>
them selves if they should avoid said cemetery and stop enabling the<br/>
further infantilization of the American public.<br/>

have lead to her Ladyship's reply sounding more curt than was needed.<br/>

Dearest Lady Prisspott,<br/>
<br/>
Your letter made me smile.  It was a rant that I wish more would read <br/>
and understand.  Thankyou and very well said!  This is one of my <br/>
favorites: "Any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a <br/>
little security will deserve neither and lose both."  -- Benjamin <br/>

&gt; Her Ladyship is also frustrated with the infantilization of American<br/>
&gt; society and the development of the "Nanny State". The American <br/>
public<br/>
&gt; seems to feel that it is a duty of the State to protect us from, and<br/>
&gt; indemnify us against, all harm. We have become children who expect <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; State to act as our constant protector leading to a diffusion of<br/>
&gt; responsibility for our own actions and choices outward and <br/>
ultimately<br/>
&gt; to the State. Your question seems an example of this. You state that<br/>
&gt; your concern is based on hearsay yet you seem to sense that you will<br/>
&gt; be held responsible if an autonomous adult engaged in the exercise <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; free will enters, of their own volition, a situation which could be<br/>
&gt; dangerous. This notion is apparently so inculcated that you are<br/>
&gt; concerned merely on the suggestion of risk, not even on the first <br/>
hand<br/>
&gt; observation of dangerous activity at the subject location. Americans<br/>
&gt; needs to grow up and realize that being an adult with a free will<br/>
&gt; carries risks and though this may seem unpleasant or unfair that the<br/>
&gt; blessings of liberty and free choice are far greater than the slight<br/>
&gt; risks we must accept. Of course there is always someone ready with <br/>
an<br/>
&gt; anecdote about some one who was injured through some one else's<br/>
&gt; negligence as if one incidence should absolve each and every<br/>
&gt; individual of responsibility for their choices. It's the same<br/>
&gt; reasoning that fills states coffers with cash from <br/>
lotteries. "Someone<br/>
&gt; has to win" the rationale goes. This is woefully wrong. Someone<br/>
&gt; eventually wins when the numbers of people playing reaches the level<br/>
&gt; of the odds. If a billion tickets are sold then it is statistically<br/>
&gt; probable that at least one person will have their numbers drawn<br/>
&gt; despite the billion to one odds that their specific set of numbers<br/>
&gt; will be drawn. Equivalently, one negative outcome of the exercise of<br/>
&gt; choice out of the inestimably large number of choices that the<br/>
&gt; billions of people on the planet make every day does not constitute<br/>
&gt; evidence of impending doom for anyone who dares to make a choice.<br/>
&gt; Given that you have no first hand knowledge of risk her Ladyship <br/>
would<br/>
&gt; say let adults act like adults who should be capable of deciding for<br/>
&gt; them selves if they should avoid said cemetery and stop enabling the<br/>
&gt; further infantilization of the American public.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This second frustration also leads to a why bother attitude which <br/>
may<br/>
&gt; have lead to her Ladyship's reply sounding more curt than was <br/>
needed.<br/>
&gt; Her Ladyship gathers that dearest Bali didn't bargain on this rant<br/>
&gt; either so her Ladyship shall untwist her knickers and you go frolic<br/>
&gt; among some graves.<br/>
