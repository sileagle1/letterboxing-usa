    This was a horrendous day of letterboxing. I could pretend it<br/>
didn't happen but I feel the need to tell my story so it never<br/>
happens to any else.<br/>
     I went alone to get a box that was newly planted in Howard<br/>
County, MD. I figured it to be a quick find and not a difficult walk.<br/>
I looked all over for the box and time was running short. I came to<br/>
the conclusion the box was missing or I was in the wrong spot. I<br/>
could see my car across the empty lake and decided to take this short<br/>
cut. Earlier there had been many people and dogs down in the area<br/>
that I planned to walk through. So across I went. Mucky started to<br/>
get muckier. When I tried to turn around to go back my right foot<br/>
sunk deep - thigh deep! I tried to dig it out but then my left foot<br/>
went just as far. I didn't have a cell phone with me, but I blew my<br/>
whistle forever. I started thinking about Rose in the movie Titanic,<br/>
blowing her whistle. Although I wasn't in ice water, the mucky mud<br/>
was very cold and stinky. The more I moved the deeper I got. Finally<br/>
someone called from shore and said he had called 911 and they were on<br/>
their way.<br/>
   Fire engines, police cars, ambulances, appeared all at once. All I<br/>
could think of was "Please Dear God don't have me on the 6 o'clock<br/>
news."  These wonderful men said I wasn't their first "stuck in the<br/>
mud" that day. It's happening all over the county. So what looks safe<br/>
isn't.<br/>
  I was stuck for an hour, So much for short cuts! Never again, this<br/>
was just about the most frightening experience I ever had. And about<br/>
that letterbox - I'll just forget about it!<br/>

Oh My!!  I will have to share your story with my firefighter husband.  I'll<br/>
bet he never imagined me needing to call emergency services for a reason<br/>
like that!!  So glad you are OK.  I would have been terrified.  Cell phone<br/>
and whistle need to become standard issue in my pack,  I can see that.  Put<br/>
your feet up and have a wonderful cup of hot chocolate.<br/>

Oh my gosh!  I'm sure it was a scary experience.  I remember as kids<br/>
my mom pointing out this mucky place along the road where she used to<br/>
live when she was young.  She said it was "sinking sand" and there<br/>
were entire horses and cars buried there.  That's what would have<br/>
been going through my mind.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you got out okay and hopefully it won't make the news.  OldShoe<br/>
is saying, "see I told you this is a dangerous hobby" (referring back<br/>
to our Chicago Underground experiences).  Despite how serious the<br/>
situation was at the time, I am laughing at the way you told the<br/>
story.  Put on some thick purple socks and cuddle up with a warm cup<br/>
of cocoa!<br/>

&gt; on another note, we want to create a traveling letterbox that goes<br/>

Christi, these "Personal Travelers In The Dartmoor Style" are<br/>
becoming more popular. I even know a dog who has one! I'd suggest<br/>
posting the info to the list just as you would for a hitch hiker, and<br/>

Funny this has come up -- I have been reading a lot lately about<br/>
Dartmoor letterboxing and this idea of a personal traveler is<br/>
something I have found an interesting aspect of letterboxing and am<br/>
surprised that it is not more commonly used here in the states.  I<br/>
suspect perhaps because of logistics, that is in England, virtually<br/>
all letterboxing is done in and around Dartmoor NP, whereas in the<br/>
states...  well, I think it is safe to say anywhere but a NP (and<br/>
even some of those).  We are much more widespread and not as likely<br/>
to meet up with other letterboxes (unless of course you live in CT).<br/>
<br/>
I have been toying with the idea, but as the likelihood of me running<br/>
across any significant number of other letterboxers, who would then<br/>
be able to get a stamp of my personal traveler, is meager, I'm not<br/>
sure it would go anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea though.<br/>

&gt; Christi, these "Personal Travelers In The Dartmoor Style" are<br/>
&gt; becoming more popular. I even know a dog who has one! I'd suggest<br/>
&gt; posting the info to the list just as you would for a hitch hiker,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; we'll sweep them onto the hitch hiker page. If the list of them<br/>

So it has not been a banner week for me!  I was informed that our<br/>
Cuckoo Clue has an error in it and now I don't know where the second<br/>
set of clues is. (and since I know I just confused everyone, yes, we<br/>
put out two identical sets of clues)<br/>
<br/>
The last people to stamp into the box where the Cuckoo Clue was<br/>
stashed were Peter and Gail.  So, Peter and Gail, if you read this,<br/>
and you have the Cuckoo Clue, please e-mail us at adglbna@aol.com.<br/>
(or just drop us a note anyway!) If someone else has the clue, please<br/>
change the bearing on the clue from 30 to 180(due South)and drop us<br/>
an e-mail!<br/>
<br/>
Apologies,<br/>

-- Many thanks for all the kind words out there! I've got my purple<br/>
socks and hot cocoa. And I'm all wrapped up in my sisters quilt. Boy<br/>
did I learn a hard lesson. I felt silly at the time but oh so<br/>
thankfull for the quick response and care from the men. Even they had<br/>
the utmost repect for the mud. They placed 8 big yellow boards to get<br/>
to me. I told them if a helicopter fly over to wave it away. No sir,<br/>
this girl was embarrassed enough. No reporters for me.<br/>
   I even tried to crawl/roll on the mud but my legs were stuck<br/>
fast.<br/>
   I'm going to carve a half woman in mud for my next stamp and call<br/>
it sheer stupidity. Live and Learn.<br/>

&gt;     This was a horrendous day of letterboxing. I could pretend it<br/>
&gt; didn't happen but I feel the need to tell my story so it never<br/>
&gt; happens to any else.<br/>
&gt;      I went alone to get a box that was newly planted in Howard<br/>
&gt; County, MD. I figured it to be a quick find and not a difficult<br/>
walk.<br/>
&gt; I looked all over for the box and time was running short. I came to<br/>
&gt; the conclusion the box was missing or I was in the wrong spot. I<br/>
&gt; could see my car across the empty lake and decided to take this<br/>
short<br/>
&gt; cut. Earlier there had been many people and dogs down in the area<br/>
&gt; that I planned to walk through. So across I went. Mucky started to<br/>
&gt; get muckier. When I tried to turn around to go back my right foot<br/>
&gt; sunk deep - thigh deep! I tried to dig it out but then my left foot<br/>
&gt; went just as far. I didn't have a cell phone with me, but I blew my<br/>
&gt; whistle forever. I started thinking about Rose in the movie<br/>
Titanic,<br/>
&gt; blowing her whistle. Although I wasn't in ice water, the mucky mud<br/>
&gt; was very cold and stinky. The more I moved the deeper I got.<br/>
Finally<br/>
&gt; someone called from shore and said he had called 911 and they were<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; their way.<br/>
&gt;    Fire engines, police cars, ambulances, appeared all at once. All<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; could think of was "Please Dear God don't have me on the 6 o'clock<br/>
&gt; news."  These wonderful men said I wasn't their first "stuck in the<br/>
&gt; mud" that day. It's happening all over the county. So what looks<br/>
safe<br/>
&gt; isn't.<br/>
&gt;   I was stuck for an hour, So much for short cuts! Never again,<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; was just about the most frightening experience I ever had. And<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; that letterbox - I'll just forget about it!<br/>

--- Luckily I had them tied on sooo tight. They were brand new<br/>
Timberlands and I wasn't about to give them up to the mud god. They<br/>
did make a huge Slurp when they came out.<br/>
   Maybe if Turtle was with me she would have talked me out of the<br/>
short cut. Turtle is more sensible than her mother. I tend to just<br/>
march ahead and see what will be.<br/>
   I think perverts wouldn't have given me a second look. I must have<br/>
had an extra 30 lbs. of mud from head to toe. My toes are still<br/>
tingling and I didn't get the thrill of crashing down the mountain on<br/>
my skis.<br/>
