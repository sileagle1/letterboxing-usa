I'm still laughing about that biker looking for nude letterboxers on the trail and I have a related story for you.  After we left the Inn that morning, I tried for one more box that required parking at an Inn and walking across a meadow.  I was gone a while trying to find the box, but my wife was not bored.  It seems a neighbor next door walked out to get his paper and he was completely naked!  I thought I had seen it all during this Event, but my wife saw more :)<br/>

&gt; It was such an honor to be in the company of so many who have helped shape this hobby of ours since it started so many years ago.  It was also so much fun to spend time with letterboxers from all over the country and close to home.  It was fun to chat with new boxers and to get to know others I have met before even better.  I was fortunate enough to share a B&amp;B with boxers I know, and boxers from far away that I haven't met before.  Thanks to J.E.S.S.sea, Lundy &amp; Vickster, Tiptoe &amp; Tonto and Silver Eagle for making our stay at the West Dover in so entertaining.<br/>

  It was great to meet all of you letterboxers staying at West Dover Inn, and also letterboxing with some of you (even with the extra hike at the end). Thanks for being so nice to my non-letterboxing wife, too. She had fun hiking and talking with all of you. <br/>

As for the naked neighbor, are you certain that wasn't Mark Pepe? We too were at that same spot shortly after you...didn't see a thing!  But, after all, Sunday was "Naked Hiking Day" - we guess hiking out to get one's newspaper counts!  That's what Mrs. Eagle gets for being "a Stacy" and not going to the box with you!<br/>
