<br/>
I tried again this morning to get to the online versions of the Valley Quest maps. I tried looking at three of them online, and encountered no problems with any of them except that the server they're parked on seems very slow. The little cluesheets are really charming -- I'm sure the stamps are the same.<br/>
<br/>
I use Netscape Communicator 4.5 and Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.0. Acrobat files are handled by a plug-in.<br/>

&gt;I had the same experience as you did with the pdf stuff.  I tried different<br/>
&gt;versions, etc.  I guess that's what I meant by the clues being inaccessable.<br/>
&gt;I generally do not like to deal with pdf and Acrobat stuff in the first<br/>
&gt;place, because its usually somewhat of a hassle in some way, so I just<br/>
&gt;decided it was easier to order the book than fight with it.<br/>
