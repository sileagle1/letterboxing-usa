Well, it wasn't exactly a "photo finish", but I'm glad to finally report that both the Hare and <br/>
the Tortoise hitchhikers which were apparently racing from somewhere out in the midwest <br/>
to get to the "Inn of the End" hitchhiker hostel in RI have both now arrived and taken off <br/>
again!  I just hobbled out to the hostel yesterday on a sprained ankle, after zero letterbox <br/>
finds for almost a week now, so I was feeling a little like a tortoise myself, but it was nice <br/>
to see that the the Racing Tortoise had actually gotten there several weeks ago, while the <br/>
Hare had visited last October and then hopped off toTexas!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope they both had a good run, and that folks won't mind if I mention that I <br/>
reached one of my own personal "finishing lines" goals recently, too!  After several months <br/>
last winter of becoming rather disenchanted with the direction letterboxing seemed to be <br/>
taking towards stamp collecting, I finally jumped back on the "Aws" wagon in the spring, <br/>
and started doing a few more of those mega letterbox hiking months that are now <br/>
possible in quite a few parts of the country, even without needing a gathering to collect <br/>
"Swoa"! (for explanation please see my plant #204, "15,000 Finds and Still Standing Tall" <br/>
aka "Requiem for an Old Growth Tree" at  alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/NewYork.html#Box_204  <br/>
.) <br/>
<br/>
So, after several trips to Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut, New York, <br/>
New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, I reached F 14,000 at "Panda" towards the end of a big <br/>
boxing day in Tyler Park, PA  in May, then went on to revisit most of those states plus a <br/>
few more to reach F 15,000 at "Sail Away" in the Adirondacks on July 31!  Sorry that I <br/>
haven't been able to keep up with e-mail, trip reports and such, but we still don't have <br/>
computer access at home, and I'm usually too busy off hiking (when I'm being a "hare") or <br/>
too slow and tired (like now when I'm in "tortoise mode") to go to the library and try to get <br/>
caught up on things, so please just understand that  we still do things the old fashioned <br/>
way around here, and please don't feel slighted if we don't manage to acknowledge all <br/>
your messages or log-ins. We really do appreciate all the wonderful boxes people have <br/>
planted for us all to find!<br/>
As Mr. Pujeh might say, "Thanks a meellion"!<br/>
