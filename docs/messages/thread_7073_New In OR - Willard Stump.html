The original owner and settler in the land around Macleay Park was <br/>
Danford Balch.  He carved out a space in the forest for a large cabin <br/>
in which to house himself, his wife, and their nine children.  A <br/>
nearby donation land claim was taken by the Stump family.  The two <br/>
families did not care for each other.  In true Shakespearean fashion, <br/>
Mortimer Stump, the eldest son of the clan, began courting Anna, the <br/>
oldest of the Balch daughters.  Danford Balch, a peaceful man, warned <br/>
Mortimer to stay away from his fifteen-year-old daughter, but <br/>
Mortimer paid no heed.  When Anna turned sixteen, she and Mortimer <br/>
ran away to Vancouver, where they eloped.  Two weeks later, Danford <br/>
Balch met members of the Stump family, including Mortimer, at the <br/>
Stark Street Ferry.  They began arguing and Balch shot Mortimer with <br/>
his shotgun, killing him instantly.  Balch later became the first man <br/>
to be legally hanged in Oregon.  The creek that runs through Macleay <br/>
Park bears his name because for years after his hanging people still <br/>
referred to that area as "The Old Balch Place."<br/>
<br/>
To The Trailhead:  From downtown Portland head west on NW Lovejoy, <br/>
which turns into NW Cornell Road.  The Audubon Nature House is about <br/>
 mile beyond the second tunnel, on the right.  Go about one block <br/>
further west, there is a parking area at the trailhead to Collins <br/>
Sanctuary.  <br/>
<br/>
Alternately, park at the Audubon Nature House and pick up a map, <br/>
located in a cupboard by the entrance to the Nature Store.  It will <br/>
come in handy for the multitude of letterboxes in the area. Carefully <br/>
cross the road at the crosswalk.  Walk about one block further west <br/>
to the trailhead at the Collins Sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
To The Letterbox:  Head up the trail into the Collins Sanctuary <br/>
trailhead.  When you reach the first trail intersection, go right.<br/>
At this junction begin counting the boardwalks.  Duck under and step<br/>
over. After you've walked the planks for the third time, go eighteen <br/>
steps more.  Willard S Stump is hiding to your right at the base of a <br/>
rotting stump.<br/>
