                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was just in San Diego three weeks ago and can report favorably on <br/>
the letterboxes in Old Town, Shelter Island, Batiquitos Lagoon in <br/>
Carlsbad, and Jack Creek Falls in Escondido.  No luck finding the <br/>
bonus box for which the Shelter Island box gives you directions but <br/>
thinking about it later I should have looked farther along the paved <br/>
path, past the sign.  You'll know what I mean when you see the place.  <br/>
The box might really be there.  My traveling campanion pooped out <br/>
before finding the Los Penasquitos Canyon box - you would have thought <br/>
I was dragging him through Death Valley.  sheesh.  <br/>
<br/>
Have fun in San Diego.  We loved our trip.<br/>
