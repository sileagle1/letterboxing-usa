companion Ruth!  We went for a nice 75 minute hike on the Pequot <br/>
Trail in Preston, CT where I found the "EMS stands for Emergency <br/>
Medical Services" boxes placed there by Patrick, Amy and Ruth.  What <br/>
great carvings!!!!!!   Sadly enough, there have only been 3 people to <br/>
find these boxes including myself, Pete/Wanda and one additional <br/>
finder.  <br/>
<br/>
So here's where they get some publicity -  the hike is not bad at <br/>
all! Go out there and find these boxes!!!!!    It is a little <br/>
overgrown for the first 5 minutes, but opens up nicely and has <br/>
magnificent views of a marshland that was once a beaver pond. Once <br/>
you cross a small stream (carefully!), there are wonderful views of <br/>
blooming mt. laurel all over some cliffs to the east ... a site well <br/>
worth the walk!<br/>
<br/>
Bring the bug spray too (you should bring it on every hike..)!<br/>
