Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
There are a few letterboxing related classes scheduled at the Tacoma<br/>
Nature Center in January.<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested check out the details at:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.metroparkstacoma.org/files/library/531bdc5fbf3c3303.pdf<br/>
<br/>
You have to 'dig' through the .pdf to find the classes but they're<br/>
there or you can try the search feature under the 'activities' tab.<br/>
Last word was that the stamp carving class was cancelled but I<br/>
wonder if there's enough 'quick' interest in it if they may be able<br/>
to resurrect it?<br/>
<br/>
Looks like these are the dates:<br/>
<br/>
14 Jan 06: Stampcarving (as of now cancelled)<br/>
21 Jan 06: Journal making<br/>
28 Jan 06: Letterboxing Overview includes some stamp carving<br/>
<br/>
You can sign up online at www.metroparkstacoma.net or call<br/>
Registration/Reservations Office at<br/>
(253) 305-1022, Mon-Fri, 8:00 a.m. - 5:30 p.m<br/>
<br/>
I've volunteered to help out with a couple of these as has Helen who<br/>
helped teach the previous class.<br/>
<br/>
It'd be great to see some of you there. There are a couple of<br/>
letterboxes on the premises and they'd enjoy seeing some more, I<br/>
presume, too. ;) They've apparently fixed up the trails since last<br/>
time I was there and have renumbered the nature trail markers--so<br/>
the clues to the current boxes will change soon.<br/>
<br/>
I've been letterboxing for 3-1/2 years now and still learn something <br/>
new at every single workshop I attend/or lead.  It's amazing the <br/>
different and effective techniques that folks develop as they <br/>
experience the letterboxing adventure on their own.<br/>
