                    <div class="plaintext-content">I second everything MommaDi said!  Everything about the gathering was just <br/>
fabulous!  SpringChick planned everything down to the nth degree, including a <br/>
coffee pot so we could have something warm to drink!  The weather was windy, <br/>
cold, and rainy, yet we persevered.  The comraderie and sharing amongst all of <br/>
the 'boxers could not be outdone.  Everyone had such great ideas!   I'm very <br/>
energized by the new techniques and ideas that were presented at the workshops.<br/>
<br/>
The stamps that were exchanged were awesome.  I am in amazement of the <br/>
artistic abilities of everyone in the crowd.  Many, many thanks to all of the <br/>
'boxers on this list who contributed their own carvings to the hitchhiker hostel, <br/>
the Visit Michigan series, the traveling boxes, etc.  I can't thank you enough <br/>
for being so generous (and talented!)<br/>
<br/>
It was so great to meet the faces (and paws!) behind the names that appear in <br/>
e-mail on this list.  There were some of us who were Michiganders, but also <br/>
many others from out of state who came to join us.  I'm looking forward to <br/>
venturing out, both MI and elsewhere, to find boxes placed by those who attended.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to SpringChick for her dedication and organization.  Thanks to <br/>
all the boxers who attended.  It was wonderful to meet all of you! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a high energy day!  Wow!  It was so great to meet everyone and <br/>
put names to the faces behind boxes and e-mails and list posts.<br/>
<br/>
OldShoe and I left Muskegon yesterday morning about 5:00 a.m. and it <br/>
rained hard the whole way to Waterloo.  Reluctantly I ran out with my <br/>
umbrealla and quickly planted one final late-coming Visit Michigan <br/>
box when we got there.  But if there was any concern in my mind that <br/>
the rain and cold might keep people home or dampen spirits, it was <br/>
quickly dispelled as 9:00 a.m. brought carloads of eager letterboxers <br/>
from the Great Lakes area, and also a few from further states (NC, <br/>
VA, PA). <br/>
<br/>
The shelter was soon a flurry of conversation and laughter, as <br/>
logbooks and stamps were passed back and forth for exchanges and <br/>
people, many attending their first letterboxing event, settled right <br/>
into the comfortable flow of the day.  Legerdemaine's K-Martha was a <br/>
big hit and our official G.L. Letterboxing Event stamp was also a <br/>
must-have for everyone's log books.  Scoutdogs also brought along her <br/>
Letterboxing North America map stamp, and we were all fortunate to <br/>
get a stamp of that wonderfully carved work of art.  "Letterboxing <br/>
Nebraska," from Scott Redd in NE, and "Mark Twain," from RTRW in CT <br/>
made appearances as traveling event boxes.  In addition, "A Little <br/>
Birdie Told Me," my 100th box, which I will be sending out to future <br/>
letterboxing events, made it's first appearance, elusively flitting <br/>
around inside the shelter.<br/>
<br/>
The rain stopped by mid-day, although the temperature never made it <br/>
above 50 degrees.  But a little cold doesn't deter the hardy <br/>
letterboxers of the north, and after a wonderful potluck lunch, most <br/>
bundled up and hit the trails in search of the 14 Visit Michigan <br/>
letterboxes that had been sent from around the country.  I know there <br/>
was at least one group that found all 14 boxes, along with the two <br/>
additional boxes that had been planted by event attendees and 4 HH <br/>
along the way, finishing up just as "it was getting too dark to <br/>
see"!  Congratulation Tom and Jill!  Several others braved the cold <br/>
and overnighted in the campground to continue the quest today, which <br/>
promises to be sunny, although still cool.<br/>
<br/>
I want to say a huge thank-you to everyone who attended the event -- <br/>
the enthusiasm and energy of everyone there certainly helped to keep <br/>
things warm!  A big thanks to those who sent Visit Michigan boxes, <br/>
traveling event boxes and to legerdemaine for the much-admired K-<br/>
Martha box.  These contributions from letterboxers around the country <br/>
certainly made us feel a part of the letterboxing community.  Special <br/>
thanks to Yooper Ann for a very informative, hands-on microbox <br/>
workshop, and to her team for the yummy grilled Chicago hotdogs, <br/>
complete with all the official toppings!  Also, thanks to StampinPam, <br/>
Vicky and Linda for sharing your wonderfully imaginative and artistic <br/>
letterbox/clue books, and to Matt the Rat for the plethora of <br/>
handmade log books that made us all drool and determined to learn <br/>
book binding techniques.  Last of all, thanks to OldShoe, who quietly <br/>
kept things flowing behind the activity and without whose help, I <br/>
would have dropped dead of exhaustion.<br/>
<br/>
Our first event was certainly a success and I'm glad that everyone <br/>
had a great time.  I know OldShoe and I couldn't stop talking about <br/>
the day the whole way home.  Thanks again to everyone involved and I <br/>
look forward to future events in our area!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Boyohboy, I don't know how the rest of you folks have your letterbox <br/>
gatherings, but let me tell you that we in the Great Lakes really <br/>
know how to put on a show!   Let me amend that.  Springchick really <br/>
knows how to put on a show and a bunch of us were smart enough to <br/>
show up and admire her work.   Here's just one example.  For the <br/>
workshops she led we each had a zip lock bag of materials, down to <br/>
the measured dental floss for sewing together the logbooks and the <br/>
velcro buttons for the stamp savers.  Our name tags had the event <br/>
logo on them and we all had program books with all the stamp images <br/>
and everyone's bio and all the directions to the event letterboxes. <br/>
Then, on top of that, 24 hours later there is everything up on her <br/>
site, including names for everyone in all the photos.  Oh, and you <br/>
think someone this organized would be difficult to be around?  You'd <br/>
be wrong.  She's relaxed and clearly having fun herself.  This woman <br/>
could be CEO of anything.  How lucky we are that instead she's made <br/>
letterboxing in our area such a wonderful thing to be a part of. <br/>
    And what turnout!  As we were driving through the freezing <br/>
thunderstorms late Friday night I thought surely no one would show.  <br/>
But, as Springchick has noted, we ended up with standing room only at <br/>
some of the workshops.  We're a hardy and dedicated bunch.  But we <br/>
sure did envy whoever it was (Linda?) who discovered mittens in her <br/>
jacket pockets!   <br/>
    There's no stopping us now!<br/>
