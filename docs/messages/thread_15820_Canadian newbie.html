I was recently introduced to letterboxing by an online (U.S.) friend <br/>
who seems to have become addicted to the pastime.  When I checked <br/>
the website, I found that there was one - ONE! - letterbox in my <br/>
vicinity (Nanaimo, BC), so my husband and I went to check it out.  <br/>
We took along a ballpoint pen with which to sign the guestbook, but <br/>
by the time we found the box, the pen had disappeared. Nonetheless, <br/>
a fine time was had by all. We'll have to go back and sign - or <br/>
stamp - in.<br/>
<br/>
Today I put together my first letterbox (called "Imagine") and I <br/>
plan to place it tomorrow.  I look forward to producing the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Great idea.<br/>

letterboxes in the area--now an even better reason to go play on <br/>
Vancouver Island!!!  Now, if we could only get some free time to <br/>
head up there to explore a bit...  If you ever get adventurous, feel <br/>
free to check out the myriad letterboxes a bit further South--in the <br/>
Puget Sound area and when you've exhausted them, Portland has <br/>
another several hundred letterboxes from which to choose.  They're <br/>
just waiting for new visitors!<br/>
<br/>
Again, welcome to letterboxing &amp; we look forward to hearing about <br/>
your adventures soon.  Stay tuned for upcoming Seattle area <br/>
gatherings, we'd love to see you there!<br/>
