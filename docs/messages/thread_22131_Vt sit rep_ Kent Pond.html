back to the Albany area. Wow, what a gorgeous area. Thanks so much, Mommafox.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes need a little attention. One had water in it and I didn't have <br/>
anything to help it; one had geocaching trinkets in it (which I left in case you <br/>
are also a goecacher) and one had a full logbook. Really loved the stop, the <br/>
waterfall, the jagged rocks with tree roots growing around them, the <br/>
beaver-chomped trees. Just gorgeous. Great carved stamps, too, especial for Beavers <br/>
Lunch. It was neat to see part of the Appalachian Trail, too.<br/>
