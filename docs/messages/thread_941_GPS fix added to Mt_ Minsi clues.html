gift from my lovely wife), I've added a GPS fix for the Mt Minsi <br/>
letterbox location.  Clues are at:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/Canopy/7962/minsi.htm<br/>
<br/>
I kinda like the idea of having a choice between using traditional <br/>
clues or GPS "clues".  Both are there, use the one(s) you like!  I<br/>
may <br/>
add GPS fixes for some of my otehr boxes.  What's the general <br/>
concensus of the group on this "hybrid" approach?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. While visiting the box yesterday, I was very happy to see all<br/>
the <br/>
visitors it's gotten!  Including an AT thru-hiker (thanks for the <br/>
note, Floater), and someone who noted that letterboxing gives their <br/>
hikes purpose.  That was way cool!<br/>
