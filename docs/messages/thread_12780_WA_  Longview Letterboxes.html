                    <div class="plaintext-content">John and I headed up to Longview yesterday.  First stop:  Lake<br/>
Sacajawea.  We knew this park, as we had paddled our canoe there a few<br/>
years back.  We found what we think was the caged Noah's Ark, but the<br/>
Arch Entrance through us for a curve, evidently. After much trying and<br/>
searching we came up empty-handed confused by the clues.<br/>
<br/>
We did find success at the Longview Library, however!  The Book Keeper<br/>
is alive and well and holding other important clues within!  LOVE the<br/>
way the Count of Monte Christo clues are done up.  What a kick!  After<br/>
Book Keeper we went off and were the first to stamp into Arabian Nights.<br/>
This letterbox is in a great location!  We will have to go back up that<br/>
way with our kayaks and put in there some time.  Thanks to Lottabit and<br/>
Lillibit for bringing this place to our attention.<br/>
<br/>
We went to the park where Headless Horseman is supposed to be and tried<br/>
to figure out the clues.  We were unsuccessful.  We thought we knew what<br/>
we were looking for eventually, but either the roman numeral is off, or<br/>
the box may be gone from the place it might have been.  We think it is<br/>
probably where it is supposed to be and that we were just off, somehow.  <br/>
<br/>
We did not go for Count of Monte Christo.  I have to go to work and have<br/>
a guy from France do some translation for me, then maybe we will have an<br/>
idea where to start.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, it was a fine day in Longview.  We may have only gotten half<br/>
the letterboxes there, but that's better than no new stamps in the<br/>
logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the hunt, y'all.  We had a nice time exploring new places.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
