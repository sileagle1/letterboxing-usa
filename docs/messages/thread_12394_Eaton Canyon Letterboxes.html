Ok-do you have any hint for us newbies?  We went to the 2nd parking lot(past <br/>
the nature center, towards the wash) past the picnic areas, across the creek, <br/>
then the main path is in front of us and we turned left- should we have taken <br/>
the small path which looked to me more straight ahead then left?  We hope to <br/>
try again Monday.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You had it right the first time at the T turn left. You will go up for a while and at the top is a clearing. Keep going until you see two large trees on either side of the trail. They shade the trail and you will notice on your left a rock and a small trail off of the main trail. Follow the directions with the paces. Be careful there is poison oak in this area! You should see the tree. The box is in the center of the five trunks at about waist level covered by debris and leaves.Good luck and be careful with the kids and the poison oak (leaves of three)Happy trails, Jam<br/>
