dropping off her grandson at the airport (new convert to boxing) <br/>
we visited various bike trails, regular spots and a new mystery <br/>
that really had us squealing (just as I was getting spoken to <br/>
about my co-piloting skills I spotted the exact thing we were <br/>
looking for!) as we got first-find and even a special prize in the <br/>
box. With 17 finds behind us we headed home to sleep and plan <br/>
for tomorrow. It's getting hard to keep up with all the new plants!<br/>
Speaking of plants, finding the engangered pitcher plant really <br/>
made the day special.<br/>
See you on the trails.<br/>
