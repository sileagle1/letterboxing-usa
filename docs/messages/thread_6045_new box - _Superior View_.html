<div>"Superior View"</div>
<div>Placed July 4, 2002</div>
<div>Located in Fort Wilkins State Park</div>
<div>Keweenaw County</div>
<div>Copper Harbor, Michigan</div>
<div>Terrain: Easy</div>
<div>Difficulty: Easy, family orientated.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fort Wilkins is a historic site located at the tip of the 
Keweenaw Peninsula on Lake Superior.  The park is located just north of the 
small town of Copper Harbor, which has a nice sampling of restaurants and small 
shops.  There is a lighthouse at the entrance to the harbor, which is owned 
by the State Park.  The land leading to the lighthouse is private property, 
access to it is done via a tour boat which leaves from the marina south of the 
town.  A ferry to Isle Royale National Park departs from here every morning 
and returns every evening.  Copper was discovered and mined here beginning 
in the 1840's creating a rush and mining boom on the peninsula for the next 100 
years.  A fort was built near the tip of the peninsula in the 1850's.  
Fort Wilkins is located between Lake Superior and Lake Fannie Hooe, a two-mile 
long inland lake.  The Fort is restored and operated by the Michigan State 
Park Commission.  Copper Harbor is a wonderful spot to visit.  The 
country is rugged, the forest pristine and a visit in the fall would be 
breath-taking.  The flora and fauna is exceptional. A side trip hiking 
the nearby forest sanctuary of Estivant Pines is well worth it.  The 
sanctuary holds stands of huge native white pine trees over 500 years old 
that were spared from being logged off. "Bring warm clothes" is a saying that 
fits, along with bug spray as both cool temperatures and black flies can be a 
concern at times.  The drive up to Copper Harbor on M-26 is gorgeous, 
departing via Brockway Mountain Drive is a must.  The lookouts from the 
Drive and the view from the top is magnificent.  Be on the look out for ore 
boats on Lake Superior heading to and from Duluth, Minnesota.  The area is 
abundant with a native plant, the thimbleberry.  Local people make the 
berry into a delicious jam.  The price may scare you off, but a jar does 
give you a piece of the Keweenaw for weeks to come when you get home.  We 
buy one every trip.  A great place to stop for jam is the Jam Pot located 
on M-26 before Copper Harbor.  The shop is run by monks who also sell 
fruitcakes and wonderful bakery products.  There is a waterfall near the 
shop that also helps make the stop worthwhile.  If you miss the Jam Pot, 
jam is also available in the shops in town.  Enjoy the drive!</div>

<div>To find the box -</div>
<div>(At the time of submission, daily user fee for the park is 
$4.00, sold at the main entrance to the Park, which should be purchased before 
parking in the parking lots of the Park.)</div>
<div>Before the main entrance to Fort Wilkins State Park there is a 
parking lot called "Lighthouse Overlook" on the north side of the road.  
Park in this lot and begin at the trail leading from the lot down to the 
lake.  Enjoy the view from the deck. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>There is an information kiosk behind the deck.  As 
you turn and face the kiosk, the trail continues off to the left.  Take the 
trail and follow along the shoreline of the lake, while observing the set of 
rocks that jut the farthest out into the bay.  Head down the trail towards 
those rocks.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You will pass the main entrance to the park above the trail on 
your right.  Soon afterwards the trail passes by a grove of cedar trees, 
also at the right of the trail.  Continue on until the trail reaches the 
side path which goes off out to the large set of rocks, but stay on the main 
trail.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>With that side path at your left begin pacing.  Take 10 
paces on the main trail.  Turn right and face four cedar trees.  Go 
through the door they form and walk straight ahead 20 paces.  Find the 
box.</div></body></html>
