I thought it would be good to kick off the night with a mini-meet. Please drop by if you can, and feel free to stay for the workshop and contribute your two cents. There will be several boxes placed just for that night. See all the details &amp; sign up here: http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=1713<br/>
