I am so sorry for your family's loss.  I know how very hard the loss of a pet<br/>
can be...you have truly lost a family member.  In my lifetime, I have lost<br/>
many, and I know how guiltridden one can be when the death was somehow caused<br/>
by yourself or a family member.  Many years ago, I owned a snowcone truck<br/>
business....I had about seven cats at the time, my favorite being a precious<br/>
calico named Callie (How original, eh?) At any rate, Callie took a liking to<br/>
sleeping up on the front tires after the snowcone truck returned home.  One day<br/>
though, unbeknownst to me, she somehow crawled up into the engine to sleep.  I<br/>
was in the truck, preparing it for the day....making lots of noise and movement<br/>
and such, but this did not rouse her.  So, I took off for my route and got<br/>
about two blocks away from the house, when I heard a very strange noise and<br/>
then the whole snowcone truck suddenly filled with flying fur. *Shudders<br/>
recalling such*  This truck was an old mail truck, and the engine case was<br/>
actually inside the truck with me near the driver's seat.  I stopped the truck,<br/>
thinking of course that I had somehow hit an animal that I did not see.  But<br/>
sad to say that was not the case....Callie had held on for two blocks and then<br/>
I guess tried to climb out, but the fan belt caught her.  Needless to say, it<br/>
was NOT a pretty site, and the memory of trying to get her out of there still<br/>
haunts me today.  At least I know that though she must have been terrified by<br/>
what was happening, that when the actual death came, it was not slow and<br/>
painful.  I tell you all of that, because I hope that your cat too did not have<br/>
time to suffer, and that you must realize that accidents happen and there is no<br/>
control over such things.  But doing things like making a photo album, or<br/>
putting a picture of your pet by your son's bed, may help.  Also, something I<br/>
have always done....when burying a pet, or even later down the line, I plant<br/>
flower bulbs with them...things that return each year, like freesia and crocus.<br/>
 That always makes me smile when they come up and brings back nice memories of<br/>
my time with the pet.  And...sometimes, its a way to get a reminder that<br/>
perhaps the pet is in a better place over "The Rainbow Bridge" and that its the<br/>
pet's way to send you a small reminder that one day, you will meet again.<br/>
<br/>
Please go to these links....I think that you will find comfort in them <br/>
<br/>
http://rainbowsbridge.com/  Please go to this site with your son, perhaps it<br/>
will ease your hearts, and give you ways to help him through it as well as you.<br/>

tear-jerker<br/>
<br/>
Or just type The Rainbow Bridge into google.com for many links.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry that I cannot join this ring at this time, though I do offer you my<br/>
heart to help you through this time.  I am very new to letterboxing and postal<br/>
boxes, and have just started carving for four other rings. Forgive me for not<br/>
being able to do another, but I am already committed at my limit for now.  I<br/>
hope The Rainbow Bridge poem helps ease your thoughts and gets you through this<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, Rasha<br/>
