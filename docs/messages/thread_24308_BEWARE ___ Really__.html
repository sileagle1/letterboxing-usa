time and effort to carve the stamp, write the clues, etc. are actually<br/>
trying to lure you into the woods so they can break into your car?  I<br/>
am sorry that this happened to you but it could have happened to you<br/>
anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I had no idea when I introduced my family to Letterboxing 3 years ago<br/>
that it was a Gateway hobby into crime!  I mean really!  <br/>
<br/>
As far as the clues, Trust me, to not be able to find a box on the<br/>
first try is not unusual - especially if you are new at it.  We are<br/>
not new at it anymore, but you did not see us wandering the woods (on<br/>
deer trails no less - let's not go there - apparently we cannot follow<br/>
actual directions or something this year).  I take my children and my<br/>
husband with me always.  Seriously, I have 1 box we attempted 3 times<br/>
before we found it and another we attempted 4 times.  So a first time<br/>
failure is nothing to be ashamed of.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say this: years ago, I worked for a Target, in a very nice<br/>
neighborhood and we had a rash of car break-ins in one section of the<br/>
parking lot.  Do you think that Target published their ad to lure<br/>
these poor unsuspecting victims into the store so that an employee<br/>
could go out and break into the cars (and no, it was not an employee<br/>
that was eventually caught).  My car was broken into when we were<br/>
traveling.  We were in a nice hotel in a nice area when it happened. <br/>
The criminal was a local druggie looking for things to pawn from<br/>
peoples cars (we found this out when they caught the guy with our<br/>
stuff).  We were only 1,000 miles from home when it happened.<br/>
Seriously, crime happens everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry that the car break in happened and that you did not find<br/>
the box, but please do not make unwarranted accusations against people<br/>
who have a much better reputation than you think....<br/>

&gt; My sisters, my son and I have been very excited to get started with <br/>
&gt; letterboxing.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We decided to go on our first hunt last night.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We printed out clues for a letterbox near us in a forest preserve in <br/>
&gt; Orland Park, IL.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First of all, we spent about 45 minutes searching since the <br/>
&gt; directions became quite vague once we were in the forest.  We gave <br/>
&gt; up, very disheartened, finding nothing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The worst part was when we returned to my car in the parking lot.  <br/>
&gt; It had been vandalized - a window had been shattered and my purse <br/>
&gt; stolen with all my credit cards and drivers license.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had just bought this car on Tuesday.  How devastating.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My husband feels that this could have been a set up.  Get people to <br/>
&gt; go deep into the forest on a search for nothing while they break <br/>
&gt; into your car.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am really sad about the car, the theft, the vandalism AND that <br/>
&gt; letterboxing turns out to be a very high risk activity.  I guess we <br/>
&gt; won't be doing this again.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">- I think a fisher cat in Chester, MA published clues to a letterbox <br/>
I looked for just to see a human jump into the brook to avoid him on <br/>
the trail.  But could have just been me.  Sorry I couldn't resist <br/>
that one. Other than the fisher cat making me walk in the brook as <br/>
he commandeered the trail for himself it was a beautiful hike.  <br/>
