will have a fitting burial after we gather to remember his short life. <br/>
Join us at Hop Brook Park in Middlebury, Ct on May 17 near noon for some <br/>
funeral food and libation.  Then, after we celebrate Gerbil's life, hunt for <br/>
some Presidents, share stamps and prizes, you will have the opportunity to <br/>
caravan to the cemetary for his interment.<br/>
Please bring food to share (crock pots are OK-we have electricity there), HH <br/>
to disburse, and anything else that suits your fancy for such an event.<br/>
Let me know who and how many of you will be coming so the proper amount of <br/>
paper products may be obtained in advance.<br/>
There is a per car charge for this park; it may be $4, so be prepared.  <br/>
Additions and corrections to this info will be posted as it becomes <br/>
available.<br/>
