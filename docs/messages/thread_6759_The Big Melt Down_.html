morning.  I then headed out for a great bike ride, picked some <br/>
blackberries, then went for a swim, and then karate. When I came back <br/>
to look at what is up, well My Grandfather would say all hell broke <br/>
loose.<br/>

Anyway, Jay Drew, Have you ever tried a snorkeling mask to keep those <br/>
eyes nice and dry. As to your skin, well maybe a wet suit will do.<br/>

P.S. Anyone feeling feisty try out snorkeling in a bubble bath. It's <br/>
a blast!<br/>

Oh, yeah, Lizard-heinie! I've been lucky to scuba dive all over the <br/>
world. Met my lovely wife underwater and first really *saw* her eyes <br/>
through a mask. Never tried it in the tub, though. I'm more a shower <br/>
man myself. Jay<br/>
