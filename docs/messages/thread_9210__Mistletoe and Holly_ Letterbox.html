website? Thanks!   The "Mistletoe and Holly" letterbox is located in <br/>
Chillicothe, Ohio (Ross County). Placed 11-14-02 by Salamander. <br/>
Difficulty : Easy.    Mistletoe and Holly are two fine feline friends <br/>
who went to find fun one day, but found themselves lost instead. (We <br/>
could say they turned up missing, but it seems to me that if they <br/>
turned up, then they wouldn't be missing- I've never understood that <br/>
phrase). Anyway, if you follow the clues, maybe you can find the fine <br/>
felines. CLUES: Go to the cemetary entrance at the corner of <br/>
Brookside Drive and Belleview Avenue. Take this entrance road until <br/>
you see a tall flagpole flying the American flag (about .4 mile). <br/>
There is a concrete bench 6 paces due north of the flagpole. Standing <br/>
at  the north side of the bench, take a reading of 15 degrees and go <br/>
32 paces. (1 pace= 2 steps). Then take a reading of 30 degrees and go <br/>
28 paces. From this spot, take a reading of 7 degrees and go 49 <br/>
paces. You should have arrived at a large Maple tree. At the base of <br/>
the trunk, there is a cave-like depression where two little kitty-<br/>
cats might be hiding behind a couple of rocks. <br/>
