their bluster about being victims of censorship, Pandora and Rayven<br/>
did practice it on their web site, they just closed and locked threads<br/>
that the "felt had become unproductive." Well Steve's incessant and<br/>
annoying self-promotion was certainly unproductive. Pandora asking one<br/>
of the devotees of LBWorld to post her biased opinion of the<br/>
circumstances is unproductive. Steve and Pandora and their group aired<br/>
their side of the story on LBWorld when they started it up and it<br/>
remained for anyone interested in the subject to read. I say ban all<br/>
posts that continue to dredge up this drama as "unproductive" and we<br/>
won't have any complaints from the devotees of LBWorld since they find<br/>
no ethical conflict in that approach to dealing with subjects they<br/>
don't like. I don't like hearing about Steve's troubles and failure to<br/>
maintain adequate back-ups, this whole discussion is unproductive to<br/>
letterboxing and the constant finger pointing is unproductive. Further<br/>
more, Pandora if your desire is to be inclusive and promote<br/>
togetherness stop having people post divisive posts for you here. So<br/>
there will be no further discussion of this topic...right? <br/>

As for making your point, your own post said it all.  Do take a <br/>
close look in the mirror.  If you want angry hurtful posts to end, <br/>
just stop.  You've heard the saying "if you aren't part of the <br/>
solution then you are probably part of the problem".  By the way, I <br/>
am done replying to your drama.  <br/>
