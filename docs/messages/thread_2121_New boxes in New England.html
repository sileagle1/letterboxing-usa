After finding over 100 letterboxes during the month of March (and over 200 during this snowy winter), we decided it really was about time to put out some of our own boxes for the spring.  So here you have directions for our first two:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.    THE DANCING MEN   (Pete's Puzzle)<br/>
<br/>
The clues are at    http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/DancingMen.html<br/>
<br/>
To earn your certificate of graduation as a "super sleuth" from Wanda &amp; Pete's Detective School all you have to do is find this letterbox!  We will be looking forward to seeing who "graduates" first.<br/>
<br/>
In case this mystery box boggles your mind too much, the next is an easy one that Wanda placed yesterday.  It's tucked away in a little pocket park surrounded by suburbia and can easily be visited on your way to the RI beaches.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2.    BIRDHOUSE HEAVEN<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  From Wilcox Park and the library in the center of Westerly, RI continue easterly on Route 1 North (up hill on Granite St. and then along Franklin St)  about 1 mile to the third light on Franklin St.  With the Mobil gas station in the triangle directly in front of you, bear right of the station onto East Avenue.  Go exactly 1 mile to a hidden driveway on the left marked by stone pillars on either side.  Although you might never have guessed, this is the main entrance to Moore Woods.  Park in here next to an old brown shed.<br/>
<br/>
Walk east past the red gate (not too fast - jogging is prohibited here!), with a stonewall on your right.  Pass through the first stonewall opening and curve gently right (south), admiring the variety of trees that were planted here over the years.  Just before the second stonewall opening swing left and eastward onto cushy pine needles.  (Going through the opening will take you onto a nice short loop through another small portion of the Moore Woods property which you might like to visit now or save for the walk back.)<br/>
<br/>
With stonewall and open field on your right, soon pass through another stonewall and begin to count birdhouses.  How many can you find?  Turn left (north) just before a metal gate and pass more birdhouses in the surrounding fields.  Turn right (east again) through the next stonewall break.<br/>
<br/>
From the silver maple on your left, head generally southeast toward the big spruces.  15 paces due south from between the second and third spruces should take you to your treasure.  Sign in and let us know your birdhouse count!<br/>
<br/>
Return the way you came or further explore the area to find more birdhouses and foundations, but watch out for the poison ivy!<br/>
<br/>
