25th birthday!   We found a hex of a location in SE CT and the box <br/>
is sitting there waiting for someone to take it on a journey! This <br/>
was originally planned to be released near the Inn, but the monsoon <br/>
kept us inn-doors most of the day and we caught a break in the rain <br/>
to plant this one at a close-by drive up box. <br/>
<br/>
I'll warn ya that the carving is not the best, but i'm just trying <br/>
to learn the trade/art/skill of it.  More boxes to come including a <br/>
Traveller for Madras, a firefighting series and the paddling series <br/>
once i complete a few test paddles.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!!!<br/>
