Davis- Winter letter box was meant to be hidden.  We found the log and<br/>
cement block but the letterbox was missing.  I hope the owner is aware of<br/>
this and plans to replace it because we would like to go back and get our<br/>
books stamped for our efforts.   We have so few letterboxes in the area we<br/>
sure hate to miss out.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to make a remark of the area,  Great location! It was fun to<br/>
find unique features like the dirt steps but there is so much litter it<br/>
really takes away from the beauty of the area.  I think if I can manage I<br/>
will take a group and do a quick clean-up.<br/>
<br/>
My husband lived in the Davis area since he was 3 and Remembers Stevensons<br/>
bridge as a child and said the dirt steps where there when he was young, 40<br/>
years ago..   It is hard to believe they survive the rain.<br/>
<br/>
I got some great close-up pictures of a spider in its web very near the<br/>
letter box area.  Take your camera!!<br/>
<br/>
Please let us know when the letter box returns, thanks!!!<br/>
