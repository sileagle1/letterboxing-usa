                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have just discovered this great sport of letterboxing!  I found <br/>
the Pacific Northwest Angler letter box tis morning.  Seems I was <br/>
the first to find it - wow what a cool cool stamp!  Ya just gotta go <br/>
get it!  There was also a hitchiker along 'Hitchiker Dude' - he will <br/>
be going with me on an out of state trip this next weekend and <br/>
hopefully will find a cool ride there.  Seems this is 'Dude's' first <br/>
time out so it will be fun to see how far he goes.  <br/>
<br/>
I found a total of 5 boxes today. Plus 2 exchanges and 2 hitchikers -<br/>
 wow! big day for basically my first day out!<br/>
<br/>
Now I have to get busy carving my signature stamp and making a box <br/>
to leave somewhere on my trip!<br/>
