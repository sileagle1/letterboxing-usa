1 2 3    1 2 3   1 2 3<br/>
4 5 6    4 5 6   4 5 6<br/>

0 P 0    0 F 0   0 X 0<br/>

This way you could go up to 987 on each letter giving account for <br/>
duplicate numbers.  You could even borrow a numeral not being used <br/>
from another swatch if need be.  Just adding a few cents to the pile.<br/>
<br/>
If Chip Goss knows where to get numeral patches already made then <br/>
maybe that's the way to go.  A final thought; if the badges change <br/>
that's alright it will be away we all can tell how long a particular <br/>
person has been LB'n.<br/>
