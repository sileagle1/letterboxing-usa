Today is my (and my husband's) 1-year anniversary of letterboxing.  The first boxes we found were planted by Two Grey Squirrels in Greenbelt Park, Maryland - Thanks Squirrel!  You got us hooked :-)<br/>
<br/>
My introduction was by a friend who saw an article on letterboxing and thought that it was something that I might enjoy.  She was right! - Thanks Gigi.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the webmasters for all of their hard work and also to every one of you who participates on this list, because even during the winter I have enjoyed reading about your adventures and am always excited to hear about all the new boxes that are out there.  <br/>

After 1 year, I am at  F53 P3 HH1 PP1.<br/>

(The PP is for Proposal - the Hare faked an email that looked like a post to this list with a letterbox near our home.  We went out to look for it together and while I was eagerly opening the rubbermaid box he went down to one knee.  What a great guy, and a very romantic proposal.  We were married earlier this year.)   <br/>

Keep those adventures coming :-)<br/>

<br/>
There was a stamp with "Will You Marry Me?" carved into it - and because my sweetie knows that it takes me a while to read things that are carved (since they are all backwards) he also had a folded up paper with the same question on it in very large font.   <br/>
<br/>
While I was trying to puzzle out the stamp before inking it, he got down on one knee and unfolded the paper with the question on it and waited for me to look up.  ::grin::    Because the clues were not actually posted (and because the site was and remains VERY mucky) we took the box back with us for eventual replanting in the general area - but not in the mud.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I thought the proposal idea was inspiring, and certainly something <br/>
&gt;you'll always remember. For others, what a wonderful way to renew, <br/>
&gt;revitalize, or even recover a relationship. By the way, what was in the <br/>
