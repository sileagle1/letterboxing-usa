You are certainly welcome, PI. Glad they were able to help you there. <br/>
Stamp Luis Obispo - Kate, Bob, and Susie - are wonderful folk, <br/>
indeed. Bob is recovering from an operation; they are a small store <br/>
and of course can use the business. <br/>
<br/>
Kate will be up in the Seattle area when we have our event on October <br/>
4th but they are going to have a special stamp and box at the store <br/>
for our event. Kate also said that she is very much interested in <br/>
giving us materials for a raffle we will be having. You understand, <br/>
folks, that we have to keep the small stores in business. Otherwise <br/>
we will never get what we truly want.<br/>
<br/>
We are also approaching another independent craft store, Law's Hobby, <br/>
for prizes. Do know that the raffle will be a free one and <br/>
JugglerMouse, Ash Raven and I will not be getting a ticket. We might <br/>
ask for any donations to help defray the cost of the park rental - <br/>
$50.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, JugglerMouse beat me at checkers today. Fair and square, she <br/>
did. <br/>
<br/>
Keep boxing,<br/>
Sir B<br/>

You can get Speedball carving medium in various sizes from The Art <br/>
Store on Raymond Avenue in downtown Pasadena (located between <br/>
Colorado Blvd. and Green St.).  They also carry carving blades.  You <br/>
can get great stamp ink at Rose City Stamps on Colorado Blvd., <br/>
located about 3 blocks east of Pasadena City College.<br/>
