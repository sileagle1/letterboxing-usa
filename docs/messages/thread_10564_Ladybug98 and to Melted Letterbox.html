                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Ladybug98!  My 2year old son and I visited your Melted Letterbox a <br/>
couple of weeks ago.  I thought you did a wonderful job finding a <br/>
place to stash it.  <br/>
<br/>
I love showing LilPup what kids can do!  I hope he grows up to be as <br/>
clever as you are.  That inkpad was a great idea -- the colors <br/>
matched up so well!<br/>
<br/>
And we got to learn a new rhyme too!  I am going to try to make a <br/>
series of our own for our favorite children's book by Jan Brett <br/>
called "Henny's Surprise".  It would be our first try at planting a <br/>
letterbox.  Wish us luck!<br/>
<br/>
PixiePam and LilPup<br/>
