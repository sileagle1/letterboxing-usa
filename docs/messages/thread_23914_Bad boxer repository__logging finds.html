radar. I for example would never want people coming to my house, total strangers, and <br/>
borrowing my stuff. :-) But everyone has their own level of interest in the various aspects <br/>
of the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
I personally am sick and tired of people asking me why I won't get an I-Pass to go thru the <br/>
tolls. I tell them I'd rather pay cash even if it is twice as much and takes longer, than have <br/>
someone other than me have a record of where I've been and what I've been doing! People <br/>
look at me like I have two heads.<br/>
<br/>
I have less than 10 finds and so I enjoy logging in my finds. I am anal like that and I like to <br/>
look at the search and see all my little flags [on Lbna.org] or whatever. It's like checking <br/>
off a list for me. Which I enjoy. :-)<br/>
<br/>
But come on, let's not make someone feel badly bc they don't enjoy an aspect of the hobby <br/>
that we personally do. I'm just saying, it takes all kinds of people to make up this world.<br/>

&gt; they didn't waste my time by emailing to request it that I wouldn't have to<br/>
&gt; waste my time replying to their request. :-) I could say, I guess, that if I<br/>
&gt; didn't log in then it wouldn't be hard for a placer to figure that I'm not<br/>
&gt; interested in logging in.  I don't consider myself under any obligation to<br/>
&gt; reply.   But yes, it might not be a bad idea for placers to know that not<br/>
&gt; everybody shares their love of that particular aspect of LbNA or atlasquest.<br/>
