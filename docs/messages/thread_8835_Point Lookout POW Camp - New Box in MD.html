<p><span>PARK INFORMATION<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Point Lookout State Park, a picturesque peninsula formed by the Chesapeake Bay and Potomac River, abounds in recreational opportunities and history.<span>  </span>Residents and visitors often enjoy swimming, fishing, boating and camping activities.<span>  </span>The cost is $3 per person May through September, on weekends and holidays only.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>This parks peaceful surroundings belie its history as the location of a prison camp that imprisoned as many as 52,264 Confederate soldiers during the Civil War.<span>  </span>In 1862, following General George B. McClellans unsuccessful campaign to capture Richmond, the federal government erected Hammond Hospital at the tip of the point.<span>  </span>The ward buildings radiated in spoke fashion from a central bay.<span>  </span>Wounded and sick soldiers began pouring in for treatment.<span>  </span>The following year, after the Battle of Gettysburg, Union authorities started sending Confederate prisoners to Point Lookout for incarceration.<span>  </span>As the prisoner population swelled to 20,000 and more, Union soldiers constructed a wooden walled prisoner pen along the bay-shore.<span>  </span>Most of the prison pen site rests under bay waters now.<span>  </span>Union soldiers held the rebel captives inside this walled area, where they lived in tents.<span>  </span>Exposure, disease and starvation took their toll and nearly 4,000 men died between 1863 and 1865.<span>  </span>A memorial to the north of the state park along Route 5 honors these men.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>Among the Federal Army units to rotate from the front to serve as guards at Point Lookout were African-American soldiers of the USCT (United States Colored Troops) Regiments.<span>  </span>Among these soldiers were SGT Christian A. Fleetwood of the USCT, a Baltimore native and Medal of Honor winner, and SGT Charles Douglass, the son of noted abolitionist Frederick Douglass.<span>  </span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The ravages of time and nature have shorn Point Lookout of many vestiges of its history.<span>  </span>There is, nevertheless, much to see.<span>  </span>A museum on site recounts its vivid history.<span>  </span>This state park also contains historic Fort Lincoln, a Union fortification during the Civil War.<span>  </span>Its earth works still exist on the river shore near Cornfield Harbor.<span>  </span>The <i>Friends of Point Lookout</i> recreated the barracks and officers quarters of Fort Lincoln and a portion of the Point Lookout POW Camps prison pen.<span>  </span>Point Lookout sponsors historic programs, demonstrations and Living History weekends each year.<span>  </span>Popular annual festivals include the <i>Confederate Memorial Service</i> in June as well as <i>Blue and Gray Days</i> in May.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
