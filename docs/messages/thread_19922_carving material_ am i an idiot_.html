    Sure, I like the speedball stuff.  I think it's like any carving, though.   Metal and wood and stone sculpters each prefer their own medium.  I just have to remember to take the different densities into account when I switch and do an eraser!  Pink stuff is also more readily available to me, too, so that's what you're getting from me.  I've heard others say that plumber's gasket is either very poor or the greatest thing since the invention of ice cream.  Different strokes.<br/>
    Now, maybe if I was trying a very tough, detailed stamp, I might find other stuff to be WAY better or not - I don't know.  My stamps are on a level with my carving ability:  very simple.<br/>

easy to carve, but it is not durable. It WILL start to crumble and<br/>
then it is only a matter of time b/4 you will have to recarve that<br/>
stamp in a medium that lasts longer. <br/>
Have you tried PZ-Kut or Mastercarve? Both are very easy to carve and<br/>
both are pretty durable. <br/>
But as the others have said, use what works best for you.<br/>
