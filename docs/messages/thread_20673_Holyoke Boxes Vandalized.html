We visited the Mountain Park boxes and the Ladybuggy box site in <br/>
Chmura Park on September 13 with the same results.  Looks like the <br/>
boxes may have been missing for some time.  Had we not had good luck <br/>
boxing at Mt. Tom, plus a pleasant day of hiking, we would have been <br/>
really disappointed, since we traveled an hour to get there.<br/>
<br/>
We too notified the placers, with no response. I'm never sure if <br/>
that is because the placers don't get the message through the link, <br/>
or because they don't have the courtesy to respond.  In either case, <br/>
it is frustrating.<br/>
