                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sleepy Cat and Princess Lea have just returned from 3 days in the letterboxing capital <br/>
of California - San Luis Obispo!  It's a trip we've been longing to take for a couple of <br/>
months, and we finally got some time to do it properly.  We have returned with 39 <br/>
"F"s (including 1 HH), 10 "A"s (attempts - box location found, but box was gone), 2 <br/>
"X"s ( we got to meet the mighty Sir Balthazar and his hunting buddy Jugglermouse, <br/>
who incidentally carved an "event" stamp of Scout dressed up in her ham costume <br/>
that was TOOOOO cute) and 2 1/2 "P"s (we designed and carved one, but didn't get a <br/>
chance to plant it - we'll be back in 2 weeks and plan to hide it then).  I managed to <br/>
pass the 100 "F" mark, and Sleepy Cat met her personal goal of finding 20 new boxes <br/>
on the trip.  <br/>
<br/>
In case anyone ever does a search online before heading down to the Central Coast <br/>
area, here are the boxes that were missing:<br/>
<br/>
Martin the Warrior (Redwall series) - he had been vandalized and Jugglermouse was <br/>
heartbroken<br/>
Onion Tree<br/>
Sad, Sad Puppy<br/>
Creatures of the Night <br/>
2 of the Chaos boxes at Lake Lopez:  Kanji and Character<br/>
all 3 boxes at Galadriel's Glade<br/>
The Fellowship of the Ring<br/>
<br/>
We reported all the missing boxes to the owners, and there are plans underway to <br/>
replace some of them.  <br/>
<br/>
In true Nancy Drew style, we found the "lost" box of St. Patrick's Flyers.  We're not <br/>
quite sure how it happened, but at some point the original box was re-hidden in the <br/>
wrong place, and so, thinking the box had gone missing, a new one created and <br/>
planted in a new spot nearby.  I had the old clue and found the original box instead - <br/>
so now there are 2 of them!<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend a trip to the area if you are considering it.  The quality of the <br/>
stamps is exceptional and many of them are "drive-bys" and don't involve much by <br/>
way of hiking and climbing.  Many thanks to the Googled Gang for making this area <br/>
so fruitful - please keep up t he good work!<br/>

I'm jealous! I have to get back down there for the rest of the boxes--I only <br/>
had time to find 22 of them! Glad your trip was a PFX wonderland!<br/>
<br/>
As for the Onion Tree box: it was there on June 14th when I found it but of <br/>
all the boxes I've been to, I would have given this one little chance of <br/>
surviving long: WAY too many people there all the time, WAY too much water in the <br/>
form of sprinklers on it all the time and in WAY too manicured a place for this <br/>
film canister not to be thought of as so much junk by gardeners and tossed. <br/>
Too bad too: it was a cute little stamp. <br/>

lasted as long as it did- still, lots of people stamped in on it <br/>
while it was there.<br/>
<br/>
We have removed the clues and don't plan to recarve that one.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for your kind review. We do try. And we hope that more <br/>
wonderful folk like Princess Lea and a very UNSLEEPY Cat (though we <br/>
doubt there are such folk anywhere like them, and we like them <br/>
muchly) can come here to hunt and play.<br/>
<br/>
Smallish correction to Her Highness Lea's post, though: Fellowship of <br/>
the Ring is still there. Raven and I found it today. True, the fake <br/>
rock was moved a bit, but it is still quite healthy.<br/>
<br/>
We will keep carving and planting them if you come to find them. <br/>
Small request, folk, let us know when you are in the neighborhood? We <br/>
are mostly friendly and would love to swap lies and stamps with you.<br/>
<br/>
Keep 'boxing,<br/>
