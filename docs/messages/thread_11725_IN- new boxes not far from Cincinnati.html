History: The Guilford Covered Bridge was built in 1879 over the Tanner's<br/>
Creek (Not it's current location, but not far from it). In the 1900's,<br/>
additional structural supports were added to sustain the heavier loads<br/>
produced by Guilford's rail commerce. In 1960, the bridge was moved from<br/>
across the creek on York Ridge Rd to the park. It was damaged by fire in<br/>
1993 and was restored in 1997. Currently, vehicle traffic is able to pass<br/>
through the covered bridge to get to the parking lot on the other side if<br/>
the gates are open (seasonal). While you are in the area, be sure to visit<br/>
Biersdorfers orchard, just 6 miles down York Ridge Rd. They have a large<br/>
duck pond where you can feed the ducks, and seasonally have fresh produce.<br/>
They have fresh cider and apples (as well as  preserves/jams/jellies) year<br/>
round from their orchard because they supply local groceries with cider. I<br/>
was there on a day they were squeezing the apples and it smelled wonderful!<br/>
They are open year round Mon-Sat 9-6 Sunday 1-6.<br/>
<br/>
Driving directions: Miller-York is located on Rt. 1 between I-74 and the<br/>
Lawrenceburg exit off I-275.<br/>
