<br/>
I was talking to a friend and fellow letterboxer recently and<br/>
commented that I'd really like to place more letterboxes.  Currently,<br/>
I only have two out there, both placed with my ex.  A third box was<br/>
planned, but has yet to be placed.  On top of that, I have about a<br/>
dozen or so neat spots I'd like to place boxes here in MA -- and am<br/>
still interesting in potentially placing a couple in NY as well.<br/>
<br/>
So, what's the challenge?  Carving, mostly.  Although I suppose I'd<br/>
get better with it with time, it's not really something I enjoy all<br/>
that much.  As a placer, my enjoyment comes in scouting locations for<br/>
boxes and developing the clues to find them.  I think both of my<br/>
boxes, Red Horse and Mary's Lamb, are reflective of that.<br/>
<br/>
So, here's what I was thinking -- partnering with other letterboxers<br/>
who enjoy the carving aspect of the hobby more than I do (and perhaps<br/>
enjoy the artistry of the carving more than the actual placement).  I<br/>
don't mean to be presumptious, but some well carved stamps combined<br/>
with my (if I may be narcissistic) well written clues and fun<br/>
locations could make for some solid and hopefully postively recognized<br/>
boxes well worth the hunt!<br/>
<br/>
A noble ideal perhaps, but why not give it a try?  Of course, full<br/>
credit will be given to anyone who carves a stamp for me -- and no<br/>
obligation regarding box maintenance is required.  You chat with me<br/>
via e-mail, we figure out what image to carve, you carve it and send<br/>
it to me, I develop the box, determine the location, place it and<br/>
maintain it.  I'll tell you where the box is, or, if you'd really<br/>
rather, let you find it on your own -- either way.  The logbook for<br/>
the box will list me as the placer and you as the stamp carver.  For<br/>
example, if someone wishes to help me finally plant Willard Clock by<br/>
carvinig a old clock stamp the box would say something like:<br/>
<br/>
Willard Clock Letterbox<br/>
by CPAScott<br/>
stamped carved by YOU<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, whadda think?  Any takers?  Let's do a duet!<br/>
<br/>
Eager to hear from you!!<br/>
