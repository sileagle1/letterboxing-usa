Redwall boxes yet? If you have at least two, you can ask JugglerMouse<br/>
for her large Martin the Warrior and ask me for my Urthstripe stamps. "<br/>
<br/>
We need one more of the Redwall  (we plan to get that Sunday) plus the ones <br/>
you and Jugglermouse are holding, We hope to trouble you for these at the <br/>
gathering. (The Redwall series are "G"s favorite boxes)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"How are you doing on the Camelot series at El<br/>
Chorro park? Have you got the ones out at Montana del Oro?"<br/>
<br/>
We are missing one from Camelot need to go back and retry. (We picked the <br/>
hottest day of the summer to try these.<br/>
We haven't done Montana De Oro  yet we're waiting for a less hot weekend and <br/>
then we are out there!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"How about<br/>
the Haunted Mine?"   Haven't heard of this one<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Other than that, there are the ones that Princess Lea and Sleepy Cat<br/>
put in up highway 101. And if you have not been down to get the<br/>
Critters of Ennisbrook, hurry down there right away."<br/>
<br/>
I'll have to look these ones up.<br/>
<br/>
We have three carved (for our Harry Potter series) and ready to plant I'm <br/>
not sure exactly what's holding us up.<br/>
<br/>
We had planed on planting them last weekend and went out to look for the <br/>
last few Middle earth boxes instead. ( we are still missing one)<br/>
<br/>
Sir B,  Thanks a great deal for not only your suggestions but your <br/>
letterboxes.<br/>
