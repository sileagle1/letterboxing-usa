I hear ya, I feel the same way. Silver Eagle's idea sounds like a good one, and would hope Randy would do something like it. For the sake of the hobby and other boxer's still yet to come. All those in favor, speak up. At least, he would hear of the love that his fellow boxers have for him and what he has done for the hobby. <br/>

Randy:  Say it isnt so!  Ive never met ya, but by gawd, Ive read your book!  Now when someone asks me about that book (prominently displayed on a small wall desk holding tiny stamp pads), Ill have to say  Yea, that was written when the world was a better place, but alas, the author has decided his time is spent  he must move on."<br/>

There is life after Letterboxing?  I think not!<br/>

YES!  The boxes of retired boxers live on.  I just checked on a box I originally found in 2003.  It had been placed in 2002, was an orphan when I found it and is still active as of last week.<br/>
