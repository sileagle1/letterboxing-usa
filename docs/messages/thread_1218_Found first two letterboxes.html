                    <div class="plaintext-content">My wife and I went letterbox hunting today, in Devil's Hopyard State <br/>
Park in Connecticut.  We found them both, one of them fairly easily, <br/>
the other one took a while.  The second of the boxes took us about <br/>
three hours to find, because we spent about a half hour trying to <br/>
find the hiding place, only to realize that two people were sitting <br/>
on top of the hiding place, smoking two smelly cigars.  We waited <br/>
them out, not wanting to reveal the location of the letterbox, and <br/>
after nearly an hour, they finally left.  <br/>
<br/>
But it was gratifying to get those first few letterboxes under our <br/>
belt!  All in all, we were in the park for about five hours.  And are <br/>
we ever exhausted!<br/>
<br/>
It looks like I'm hooked.  My wife will only come with me once in a <br/>
while, since I'm the hiker type, and she's not.  But it was nice to <br/>
share these first few with someone.  Any other first-timers this <br/>
weekend?<br/>

Hi Chris...congratulations to you and your wife on your <br/>
first "finds".  The first one me and my daughter found here in <br/>
Virginia was exciting.  I'm a first timer as well this weekend.  I <br/>
hid my first three in Virginia Beach.  Placing them is as much fun as <br/>
finding them!  Next trip to VA Beach, it will be fun to check them to <br/>
see if anyone's stamped in.  Keep hunting, and happy hiking,<br/>
<br/>
Kathy<br/>

I went saturday for the first time, too.  I read the<br/>
article in the Courant last week and decided I had to<br/>
try it... I carved my stamp friday night a 11:00 pm...<br/>
I followed a scotland, CT trail and found bot<br/>
letterboxes.  Just before I found the second, I was<br/>
hit by a downpour and got soaked, but it was fun<br/>
anyway.  I can't wait to get out again! Hopefully this<br/>
week at Mansfield Hollow...<br/>

&gt; I had an awesome time this weekend too. i found my first letterbox <br/>
in the J.B. Williams Park in Glastonbury. it was fairly easy but what <br/>
a great feeling of accomplishment when i found it.  I am definately <br/>
hooked too. i hope to go up to Longmeadow, MA and maybe Mansfield, CT <br/>
too. i am so glad i saw the article in the Courant and also that CT <br/>
has so many different locations to look for the letterboxes. To all <br/>
the people who hide the letterboxes keep up the great work!! Amy B<br/>
