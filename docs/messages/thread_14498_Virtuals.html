Here's the list of virtuals that I know of.  There's one more, but <br/>
it's a real box that is/was also available as a virtual on the old <br/>
site.  For some reason, that box is not listed on the new lbna site, <br/>
so I'm not going to post that one.  I did email Wes with this list, <br/>
and that additional box.  He can contact that person to see if they <br/>
still want their box (virtual or otherwise) to be listed.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the list:<br/>
<br/>

we got a stamp and could care less as to how many events we attend. <br/>
(Currently at E1, and an additional P+1 for the event we held). We <br/>
have 4 virtuals from the CodyBCleo Sunshine series and count them as <br/>
V = Virtuals.  Make sense? We did print out the images on a color <br/>
printer and glue-stuck (word?) them into our logbook for safe-keeping.<br/>

You'll often see HH for hithchiker found, we call them F(inds). And <br/>
FF for first finder -- though a certain Rhode Islander keeps beating <br/>
us to them, so we have no "FF"'s <grin>. <br/>
