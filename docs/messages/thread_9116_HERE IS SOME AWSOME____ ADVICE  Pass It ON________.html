 Got this from a friend, thought it had some good advice.<br/>
   **********************************<br/>
<br/>
   This is good to know!<br/>
   A corporate attorney sent the following out to the employees in his company.<br/>
   I pass it along, for your  information.<br/>
<br/>
   The next time you order checks have only your initials  (instead of first<br/>
name) and last name put on them.<br/>
If someone takes  your check book they will not know if you sign your checks<br/>
with just your  initials or your first name but your bank will know how you sign<br/>
your  checks.<br/>
<br/>
   Put your work phone # on your checks instead of your home phone.  If you have<br/>
a PO Box use that instead of your home address.  If you do not have a PO Box use<br/>
your work address. Never have your SS# printed on your checks -- you can add it<br/>
if it is  necessary. But if you have it printed, anyone can get  it.<br/>
<br/>
   Place the contents of your wallet on a photocopy machine, do both sides of<br/>
each license, credit card, etc.  You will know what you had  in your wallet and<br/>
all of the account numbers and phone numbers to call  and cancel. Keep the<br/>
photocopy in a safe place. I also carry  a photocopy of my passport when I<br/>
travel either here or  abroad.<br/>
<br/>
   We've all heard horror stories about fraud that's committed on us in stealing<br/>
a name, address, Social Security number, credit cards,  etc.<br/>
<br/>
   Unfortunately I, an attorney, have firsthand knowledge because my wallet was<br/>
stolen last month.  Within a week, the thieve(s) ordered  an expensive monthly<br/>
cell phone package, applied for a VISA credit card, had  a  credit line approved<br/>
to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN number  from DMV to change my driving<br/>
record information on-line, and  more.<br/>
<br/>
   But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case this happens<br/>
to you or someone you know We have been told we should cancel  our credit cards<br/>
immediately.  But the key is having the toll free  numbers and your card numbers<br/>
handy so you know whom to call.  Keep  those where you can find them easily.<br/>
<br/>
   File a police report  immediately in the jurisdiction where it was stolen,<br/>
this proves to credit providers you were diligent, and is a first step toward an<br/>
investigation (if there ever is one).<br/>
<br/>
   But here's what is perhaps most  important: (I never even thought to do this)<br/>
Call the three national  credit reporting organizations immediately to place a<br/>
fraud alert on your name and Social Security number.  I had never heard of doing<br/>
that  until advised by a bank that called to tell me an application for credit<br/>
was made over the Internet in my name. The alert means any company that checks<br/>
your credit knows your information was stolen and they have to contact you by<br/>
phone to authorize new credit.  By the  time I was advised to do this, almost<br/>
two weeks after the theft, all the  damage had been done.<br/>
<br/>
There are records of all the credit checks initiated by the thieves' purchases,<br/>
none of which I knew about before  placing the alert.  Since then, no additional<br/>
damage has been done,  and the thieves threw my wallet away this weekend<br/>
(someone turned it  in).  It seems to have stopped them in their tracks.<br/>
<br/>
   The  numbers are:<br/>
Equifax: 1-800-525-6285<br/>
Experian (formerly TRW): 1-888-397-3742<br/>
Trans Union: 1-800-680-7289<br/>
Social Security Administration (fraud line): 1-800-269-0271<br/>
We pass along jokes; we pass along just about everything.<br/>
 Do think about passing this information along.<br/>
It could really help someone you care  about.<br/>
