                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well that was a real suprise. I did not think anyone would ever find that<br/>
one, but you did. It had been there for several years unfound. It's a lot<br/>
of trouble to follow all those clues and you probably did the GPS thing<br/>
on it. Good for you. I am tagging on the yahoo groups  on with this<br/>
reply. Hope you don't mind. Joining the group &amp; Posting directly to the<br/>
yahoo community at letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com will bring in lots of<br/>
letterbox responces , if you haven't done that already.  There may be<br/>
other's that may want to find out more about how you did that without<br/>
following the clues. You must have done a bee-line bushwack, over all<br/>
kinds of treacheous terrain. That was the trickest letterbox by<br/>
"budster"....... If you like a back woods trail following a stream, check<br/>
out the "BlueBerry  Farm" letterbox.......a delightful Catskill Mountain<br/>
Trail.<br/>
	Should I come up with even a  more challenging one?  I'll work on one if<br/>
you think anyone would bother to go for it. Otherwise , the rest will be<br/>
easy ones.<br/>
	BTW  , we have been exploring the "gunks" and have found some great<br/>
places to lead others to.....<br/>
