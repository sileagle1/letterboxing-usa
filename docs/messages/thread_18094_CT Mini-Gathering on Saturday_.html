I introduced my class to geocaching and letterboxing on Thursday and <br/>
they are hooked!  They first were taught how to use a compass and <br/>
then introduced to the GPS.  Next, I had them find their first <br/>
Geocache which coincidently had their stamps in it.  When we <br/>
returned to the room, we followed clues to find their first <br/>
letterbox!  I am sure Saturday will be wonderful!  For anyone <br/>
looking to attend the letterboxing mini-gathering and meet 6 new <br/>
letterboxers, we will be at Putnam Park (Putnam Memorial State Park <br/>
&amp; Danbury Boxes) finding some letterboxes and geocaches at 9:30 AM.  <br/>
At 12:00 we plan on meeting everyone at Huntington State Park <br/>
(Peanuts, Physics 101, and Colis P. Huntington Letterboxes) for some <br/>
lunch and chit-chat.  We will probobaly hit the trail at 12:30-ish <br/>
to find some boxes/caches and hike with our new friends.  I hope you <br/>
all come to enjoy a nice day of letterboxing, as well as a new event <br/>
stamp/traveller and a few new exchanges.<br/>
