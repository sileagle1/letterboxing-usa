Hey thanks for the info - there is (yet) another talk list devoted to the reporting of <br/>
hitchhiker traveles at this link:<br/>

SATCHMO for those that might be confused, is the beloved jazz musician, Louis <br/>
Armstrong, and a partner in crime of my many jazz musicians. Also released <br/>
among those was HERBIE MANN (jazz flutist) as well as my mystery MONK (of Notre <br/>
Dame)  and MILES which was stolen away. Hot stuff!<br/>

I was doing the Bikini Bottom series by the L Troop, then over to <br/>
Oak Leaf, and while I was in the area, figured I had time for that <br/>
one as well :) (Was about 6:30 by the time I made it out of the <br/>
woods at Jabish Brook) Just in the nick of time before it started <br/>
getting REALLY dark :)<br/>
