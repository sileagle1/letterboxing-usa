                    <div class="plaintext-content">My daughter and I would like to plant a series that serves as a <br/>
reminder of all the wonderful places we visited on our relocation trek <br/>
from Utah to Florida in 2003.  We have some great family memories and <br/>
we will write little stories to go with each plant.  I want to help the <br/>
kids remember this important together time.<br/>
<br/>
We are hoping folks in each of these states will help.  If you are from <br/>
one of the states below and would consider carving a stamp that <br/>
represents something for which your state is 'known' (your choice), <br/>
please contact me at 2brno2b@comcast.net .  I will get these all <br/>
together and plant the series here in the Tallahassee area - "The UT/FL <br/>
Trek".  I think I've found a great place for it.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
UT  (started in Ogden.  2 cars, , 2 parents, 4 kids, 2 jam-packed <br/>
trunks, lots of snacks &amp; one turtle!)<br/>
WY  (stayed at a really cool hotel with and painted murals on walls and <br/>
pool)<br/>
CO  (wasn't a 'necessary' state on our trip, but we wanted to hit as <br/>
many states as possible.  Went to a little museum in the NE corner of <br/>
the state).<br/>
NE  (blew a radiator in Kimball and stayed 4 unplanned days)<br/>
IA  (barley clipped the corner of IA)<br/>
MO  (stopped at a well kept hotel with an untreated, decorative fresh <br/>
water pool out front.  Our turtle swam and thought she'd found heaven)<br/>
KS  (Got lost in KC!  LOL.  Thanks to AAA.)<br/>
IL  (special stop in Alton - one of one of my sons names)<br/>
KY  (stayed an extra night in Paducah.  We were exhausted and people <br/>
were so nice.)<br/>
TN  (remember the color of green mostly.  Beautiful.)<br/>
AL  (we didn't stop anywhere in AL, just wanted to get there.  Had <br/>
wanted to hit museums in Birmingham.)<br/>
FL  (In was pitch dark when we hit the state and the drive on the 10 <br/>
from the P'cola area to Tally seemed neverending.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!!!<br/>

also posting on the Rocky Mtn Yahoo talk list:<br/>

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RMLetterboxing/<br/>
<br/>
(I should think you may also want to post on the other relevant <br/>
regional boards rather than this "big list")<br/>
<br/>
I might be able to help with CO and possibly WY since I have a few <br/>
boxes to plant up that way this summer if no one else pipes up, but <br/>
I'm in the middle of a household move at the moment and May, at <br/>
least, is spoken for.  And after the winter we've had..well, IF <br/>
summer ever gets here....maybe I'll get back to carving in the <br/>
fall. ;-p<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to contact me off list for further chatting.<br/>

so everyone knows)<br/>
