Hey Guru....I found the email address of the person who placed the <br/>
Whisper letterbox in Smithtown NY.  I last corresponded with him in <br/>
January, 2001, so I can't guarantee the email address is still <br/>
valid.  Send me another note at krl229@comcast.net and I'll send you <br/>
his email address.<br/>
<br/>
As I told you, I'd love to help you out with your event in my <br/>
hometown, but I'm hoping to be in RI at a soccer tournament that <br/>
weekend and am holding the day on my calendar for that.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck spreading the word on LI.<br/>
