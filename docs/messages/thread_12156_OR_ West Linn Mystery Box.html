I just went looking for that box a couple months ago when visiting my significant other in West Linn -- I didn't find it, boy were we stumped... but then again I am not a local that knows my way around OR (yet) -- I am headed back up that way in a couple of months. Was wondering if you would just tell me where it was??<br/>

I would like to know this as well!  We went looking for it a couple of times, <br/>
and I think we figured out where it was, but it was raining really hard so we <br/>
decided not to go search for it with a 2yo in tow.  It was one of those boxes <br/>
that we figured we'd get around to "someday".  Guess we waited too long.  At <br/>
least our hitchhiker got to visit it!  LOL<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ultimately, this box was a drive by &amp; an awesome stamp, too!  <br/>
Literally, a 'drive up to it' box--once you figured out where it <br/>
was.  We found it's location on our first attempt and even the <br/>
chiseled out hole in the sand where it was hidden, but alas no box.  <br/>
Then, version 2.0 was released and we went to nab it as soon as we <br/>
could (even though we live about 150 miles away).  I was a little <br/>
apprehensive about the hiding spot because it really seemed <br/>
vulnerable.  I sort of had that 'don't want to leave my young' <br/>
behind feeling when we went to leave the area after stamping in.  We <br/>
hid it as well and inconspicuously as we could but I think the area <br/>
is just too exposed.  <br/>
<br/>
While there, I was trying to find other possible hiding spots that <br/>
might work--since the clues are so cool.  There was an interesting <br/>
tree a few paces to the Northwest of the hiding spot that might have <br/>
worked.  Perhaps 'at the egrets feet where the rivers meet, the base <br/>
of the tree to the Northweet' might work...  ;) I also thought a <br/>
camouflaged 'tree ornament' microbox might survive there or even <br/>
a 'submerged' box.  If anything, a microbox would probably fare much <br/>
better in that location given the exposed nature of the area.  My <br/>
experience, however, has been that once a letterbox goes missing in <br/>
one location and is replaced--it often goes missing again.  I wonder <br/>
if it's sometimes the same person returning to the spot to see what <br/>
they might find during their next visit?  That's why I often change <br/>
the hiding spot slightly when I replant the boxes of mine that go <br/>
missing.  To keep the box-nickers on their toes, at least...<br/>
<br/>
So sad to have to farewell a great letterbox...  :( <br/>
<br/>
Hang in there!<br/>
