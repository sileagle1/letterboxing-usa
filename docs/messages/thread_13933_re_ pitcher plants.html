I too, love flowers of all kinds. We spoke of this ages ago as you <br/>
were <br/>
planning an historic garden letterbox series. It surely is a treat to <br/>
happen upon an unusual native plant. I have seen picture plants while <br/>
canoeing in upstate N.Y., and also upon the Ipswich river in R.I.  <br/>
(North <br/>
shore).  The Botanist teacher ( a great friend of mine) at Tolland <br/>
High <br/>
spoke to me of pitchure plants growing in a boggy area near the <br/>
track/football field.  I have noticed tons of trillium plants in <br/>
recent <br/>
hikes--no blooms yet, but unmistakable 3-leafed folliage. thanks for <br/>
sharng!<br/>
