<br/>
I've got my little homemade stamp and a journal I<br/>
hadn't written in in about 20 years, all ready to nab<br/>
my very first letter box about a half mile from where<br/>
I work. And the trail is closed, presumably due to the<br/>
downed trees from the ice storm damage we had back in<br/>
December.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/nc/juneflowers.htm#crabtree<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So this brings up an issue that has been niggling<br/>
around the back of my mind since I seriously<br/>
considered getting involved in Letterboxing. And that<br/>
is the issue of upkeep and accurate clues. <br/>
<br/>
What is the responsibility of the person who places<br/>
the box to visit it and make sure it's still there,<br/>
undamaged, and still accessible?<br/>
<br/>
I feel real uneasy about planting boxes in parks<br/>
anyway. I mean there are park staff whose job it is to<br/>
clean up and get rid of such stuff.<br/>
<br/>
What do you all think? Is there any official policy?<br/>
<br/>
Disappointed in NC,<br/>
