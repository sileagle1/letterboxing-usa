                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to add our Kudos to 2 new series we enjoyed recently in CT:  Jay Drew's Fab Four (Beatles) series of 5 at Meadow Woods in Essex and Bill and Vals Chatfield Hollow (Witches Hollow) series of 6.They were both marvelously laid out, highlighted interesting topographic features, and had fantastic stamps!  We also got a kick out of Road to Hell and several others.  Were lucky to have so many talented folks placing boxes in the area.  Many thanks to all of you!Wanda and Pete<br/>
