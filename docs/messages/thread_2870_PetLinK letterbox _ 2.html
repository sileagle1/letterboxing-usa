Grafton Notch Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Grafton Notch State Park:<br/>
<br/>
Bethel, Maine is your starting point.  Take Route 2<br/>
east for about 6.5 miles.  You will see a green sign<br/>
that says Grafton Notch State Park.  Take a sharp left<br/>
on to Route 26 to New Hampshire.  Drive 9.7 miles to<br/>
the entrance to Screw Auger Falls, which will be on<br/>
your left.  Drive in and park your car.  You will see<br/>
a map and a sign that indicates that $1.00 is needed<br/>
for a day's use of the park / honor system.  You are<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
We have written up two sets of clues.  Set One is a<br/>
fairly difficult walk on a footpath and Set Two is<br/>
less difficult along Rt. 26.  <br/>
<br/>
Set One:  Look at the map.  Take one of the paths to<br/>
the Gorge Overlook that includes a footbridge.   Check<br/>
out the Gorge.  Isn't it breath-taking?  Now, continue<br/>
on past the brown safety fence and walk along a<br/>
footpath that gets a bit tricky here and there.  Keep<br/>
the river to your right.  Work your way along the path<br/>
until you get to a point where you can go no further<br/>
without crossing the river.  Do a 180 and head back to<br/>
the incredible wall of moss-covered boulders.  See all<br/>
of the awesome letterbox hiding places?  ;-)  Walk up<br/>
over the banking, keeping the wall to your left.  Work<br/>
your way to the highway.  It's Route 26!  Find the<br/>
washed out area that is just off the highway.  It's<br/>
the only real washout there.  Walk to the road.  Do<br/>
another 180 and head back in about 20 paces, bearing<br/>
left-ish.  There's a large rock with an old Hemlock<br/>
growing partly on the rock and partly on the ground. <br/>
Under the rock-cave and behind some old leaves is the<br/>
letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
Set Two:  After parking your car in the Screw Auger<br/>
parking lot, walk out to the highway and turn right. <br/>
Walk along, keeping the river to your right.  You will<br/>
see three "No Parking" signs.  At the third sign,<br/>
start counting paces.  After 80 paces, look to your<br/>
right and you should see a washed out area.  There's a<br/>
neat old gnarled birch tree that sits proudly to the<br/>
left of the wash out.  Walk 20 paces in, bearing<br/>
left-ish and you will see a large rock with an old<br/>
Hemlock growing beside as well as on it.  Under the<br/>
rock-cave, concealed by old leaves, is the letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun, you guys!  This is beautiful country.  Enjoy<br/>
Mother Nature at her best.  Linda and Peter<br/>
