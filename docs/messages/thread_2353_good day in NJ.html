I was in a boxing frenzy and decided to take the day off from work and<br/>
pick up some new stamps for my journal.  I will be out of the country<br/>
(Holland) and wanted to get some boxing in before I left.<br/>
<br/>
"Fisherman's Point" was very quiet today with no one to spy on me.<br/>
"Into the woods" was great.  Lake Manny is very pretty, very scenic.  I<br/>
have all 6 of your stamps, unless you put out more since then.  Thanks<br/>
for the hunt.<br/>

"The Tourne" gave a beautiful view of the city.  The stick I chose to<br/>
retrieve the box broke so I had to be a daredevil and just stick my hand<br/>
in.  It was a success!  I was growing weary but I stuck it out and<br/>
located "Mountainside".  The second campfire gave me a tiny bit of<br/>
trouble, but I was soon presented with the clue.  Yummmm!!! that ice<br/>
cream was good!!!  The stamp wasn't the only prize I brought home with<br/>
me.  A tiny silkworm decided to hitch a ride in my hair.  Yikes!  But<br/>
that is so much better than a giant snake.  *s*<br/>
<br/>
? for all,<br/>
Has anyone have any info on boxes in Europe, besides England?  I was<br/>
wondering if while I'm in Holland I should plant a box.  Thanks in<br/>
advance for your input.<br/>

I'm glad to hear you liked the other letterboxes. And, you're <br/>
correct--you have all 6 of our stamps--so far! We have two other <br/>
boxes already planted for which we haven't yet finished the clues, <br/>
and I've got some more stamps sitting on my desk, ready to go. <br/>
I'll get them up on my website soon, I hope....<br/>

Thanks for letting me know that "The Tourne" and "Mountainside" have <br/>
been found.  It's good to know that the clues were readable.  I'm <br/>
glad to hear that you enjoyed the ice cream too. <br/>
<br/>
Also, thanks to everyone that wrote to me letting me know that "Stone <br/>
Needle" is still there, I am going to retry it again soon.<br/>
