if there are rules we've had to break them for our Lighthouse series. We do however believe that if the reasoning fits and it's still an interesting outing there's no issue. Some are close some are far, It's the adventure that makes it good!<br/>

I think you have to 'think outside the box' to imagine these<br/>
possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; You can still be aware by looking at what's there unless they are mystery<br/>
&gt; boxes. Not that hard.<br/>
<br/>
On the contrary, it is hard.  Some web sites, for example, require that<br/>
you have logged so many finds on that web site to see all the boxes in<br/>
a particular area.  Given that, how is it possible for non-users of<br/>
those web sites?  May these non-users not create boxes under your rule?<br/>
<br/>
Not only are you suggesting a rule, you are therefore suggesting the use<br/>
of specific web site(s) and levels of performance on those web site(s)<br/>
in order to comply with this suggested rule.<br/>
<br/>
Hard indeed.<br/>

Not at all.  I don't think the suggestion is reasonable, that's all.  If<br/>
everyone felt it was reasonable, it would not be an issue of contention.<br/>
<br/>
You can't say 'don't saturate an area with boxes', and then say 'you are<br/>
not making rules', especially when the rule is pointless,<br/>
unquantifiable, and unenforceable.<br/>
<br/>
Its just someone's opinion of how the letterboxing world should be to<br/>
them, and I disagree with it.  And I'm entitled to rational <br/>
disagreement. Calling me names won't change my opinion of the<br/>
wrongheadedness of the "suggestion".<br/>

My two cents:  in these days of high fuel prices and efforts to reduce our carbon footprints, I'm happy to find boxes in relatively close proximity!<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I once planted a box in a wall apparently immediately under an existing box.  I was unaware of the box, because it was a part of a lengthy, multi-town series, listed by a different town.  One of these days I'm going to find that series!!<br/>

Beyond the fact that there may be a mystery box or three in any given <br/>
area, why should anyone really worry about being close to another box.  <br/>
If you are clever you can write clues that will lead one to the box in a <br/>
totally different way.  And if the finder is clever they will figure out <br/>
they are in the same place.  Try thinking outside the everyday step by <br/>
step clues.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I missed the first few mails on this question but- when placing a box I usually only worry about geocaches. The trick is to keep a little distance from them. Since I will hunt for them, too, I understand the problems that crop up for that crowd. There are some truly evil people that create caches that cause one to think of murder (I'm kidding, I'm kidding...). Cachers with that kind of experience will range out widely to get their fix. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not worried about saturation, it just more fun. For example, the State of Connecticut placed a box roughly eight feet from one of mine. I highly doubt they checked-so what?<br/>

Hey new type person- distance? Do what you want.<br/>

recently planted a box very close to another and the original planter <br/>
was very happy to have another box in her area to find.  If you have <br/>
any questions about planting near another box, simple write to the <br/>
person who planted the original and ask if they mind.  Otherwise, I <br/>
think it's perfectly OK to plant wherever you decide.  As previously <br/>
stated, there are no rules regarding this topic and if the person who <br/>

&gt; Beyond the fact that there may be a mystery box or three in any <br/>
given <br/>
&gt; area, why should anyone really worry about being close to another <br/>
box.  <br/>
&gt; If you are clever you can write clues that will lead one to the box <br/>
in a <br/>
&gt; totally different way.  And if the finder is clever they will <br/>
figure out <br/>
&gt; they are in the same place.  Try thinking outside the everyday step <br/>
by <br/>
&gt; step clues.<br/>
