<p><b><span>Webmaster:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>This 
is our first box posting and I hope we've done it right.  We probably will 
add more boxes so you could call the page Maggie's Family's Boxes or something 
like that.  Here we go.  Thanks.</span></b></p>

<p>E-mail: <a href="mailto:Maggies.family@verizon.net">maggies.family@verizon.net</a> <br/>Date Placed: 09/16/02</p>
<p>Time:<span>  </span>3-4 hours by bike, 
round trip, with stops<br/>Location: Virginia Beach, VA<br/>Difficulty: Serious 
walk; fun, easy bike ride.</p>
<p> <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = 
"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>You wont have to work on Maggies Farm no more</p>
<p>If you follow Maggies Family . . . . .<span>  </span>to the shore.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Our first box weve stashed in a beautiful place,</p>
<p>Where people are scarce, yes, hardly a trace.</p>
<p>Its not easy to get to, in fact quite a hike,</p>
<p>So may we suggest that you dust off your bike.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Load up the car and head Back to the Bay,</p>
<p>Youll pass through the bridge of Sand on your way.</p>
<p>Follow Sandpiper south to the Refuge gate,</p>
<p>When you get to the Station, theres no need to wait.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Youll see lots of birds, and horses, and maybe a wild boar,</p>
<p>So pay the five dollars and be glad its not more.</p>
<p>Unload all the bikes and start down the path.</p>
<p>Youve got four miles to go, because we did the math.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Take your water, your camera, your lunch, and embark,</p>
<p>Go down the main path and head for the park.</p>
<p>Youll come to a fork, both trails well-traveled.</p>
<p>But go left on East Dike; we hope youre not baffled.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>And whatever you do, dont take the Dune Trail,</p>
<p>Youll end up on the beach and you will have failed.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Youll pass by a sign with a date and a duck.</p>
<p>You may think its there, but oh, no such luck!</p>
<p>We hid it there first, but we did all agree,</p>
<p>It was too easy to find, and theres much more to see!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Peddle on to the park and dont miss the boat,</p>
<p>Veer to the left and be sure to take note.</p>
<p>Youll come to a platform, 22 it is marked,</p>
<p>Stop for a rest, youll be glad that you parked.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Soon youll be at the Station, in a moment or so,</p>
<p>Its quite clean and tidy in case youve Got to GO!</p>
<p>Youll see a small shop and tables (if youve brought something to 
eat)</p>
<p>Insides a nice man who we think you should meet.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Look all around at this blissful location,</p>
<p>Its a nice place to camp should you be on vacation.</p>
<p>But since youre on a real quest, turn left at the sign,</p>
<p>That reads, Ocean/Beach Camp. Youre close to the find!!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Past the ramp on the left (but what is it for?)</p>
<p>NO! Dont turn right to Washwoods - keep on to the shore.</p>
<p>The trails a bit sandy. Its a little hard going,</p>
<p>We saw horses there -- their manes all aglowing.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>When you get to the walkway (its wooden) just park,</p>
<p>Time to walk a ways now so get on your mark.</p>
<p>Step on to the planks and count out your paces,</p>
<p>Fifty, sixty, or more if you wear little shoelaces.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Pass Delicate Dunes and glance right for our riddle,</p>
<p>Youll see some bushes with a dead branch in the middle.</p>
<p>Reach down in the sea grass, but look fore you grab,</p>
<p>Youll discover our prize, and we hope not a crab!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Now once youve stamped in you can do what you likes,</p>
<p>But may we suggest that you get back on your bikes.</p>
<p>Head over the dunes, and we hope its low tide.</p>
<p>Because if it is you are in for a ride!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>And even if the tide is a little bit high,</p>
<p>Just follow the beach with the ocean right by.</p>
<p>Its a beautiful site, unspoiled, like a myth,</p>
<p>Must have looked much the same to Capt. John Smith.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Head back whence you came and try not to roam,</p>
<p>NOW take the Dune Trail and find your way home.</p>
<p>So ends your adventure. The day is now done.</p>
<p>Good luck on your next quest. We hope youve had 
fun.</p></div></body></html>
