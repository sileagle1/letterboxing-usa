Thank you all for your patience while I was away on vacation in the Midwest <br/>
this past month. My time was well spent with friends and family and was <br/>
altogether refreshing.<br/>
<br/>
I am extremely pleased and somewhat overwhelmed at the fantastic volume of <br/>
activity that has occurred in the past several weeks.  Congratulations to all <br/>
the new letterbox creators.  While in The Heartland, my 4 year old nephew <br/>
(Little Foot) and I placed a few letterboxes of our own.<br/>
<br/>
On 9/9/99, we placed The Cornhusker Letterbox in Lincoln, Nebraska, which I <br/>
believe to be the first in that state.  It's location features awesome <br/>
lakeside views of the State Capital and Cornhusker Stadium.<br/>
<br/>
To compliment last year's Kirwin Lake Letterbox, Little Foot and I have now <br/>
completed an entire series of Northwest Kansas Lake boxes.  There are stamps <br/>
to be collected at six lakes, altogether, including Waconda, Sebelieus, <br/>
Webster, Cedar Bluff, and Wilson.  All are easily accessable from either <br/>
Interstate 70 or Historic 36 Highway.<br/>
<br/>
Due to forces of nature, we had to relocate last year's Wheathead Letterbox.  <br/>
Kansas' first letterbox is now located at the Geographic Center of the 48 <br/>
Contiguous States.  Details (and photos) of all these adventures will follow <br/>
in days to come.<br/>
<br/>
I will presently begin my attempt to get the website updated as quickly and <br/>
efficiently as I can manage.  My gratitude goes out to our friend Randy <br/>
(Mapsurfer) Hall who (as always) has been faithfully cataloging all the <br/>
recent letterboxing activity in my abscence.  His support is greatly <br/>
responsible for the quality and accuracy of the Letterboxing North America <br/>
website.  Many thanks also to Tom Cooch, who has been diligently keeping up <br/>
with the letterboxing activity in the NY / New England area.<br/>
<br/>
My prayers go out to all of you in the East who are weathering the <br/>
devestating hurricane onslaught.  May God be with you.<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Love,<br/>
Mitch (Der Mad Stamper)<br/>
Portland, Oregon<br/>
