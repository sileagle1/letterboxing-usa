what the poll reveals.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm not fond of the idea, not because it stinks or anything, but because<br/>
of my early days as a letterboxer.  When I first started I  swore up and<br/>
down that the Mt. Tabor LB in Portland, Oregon was missing and even<br/>
called Der Mad Stamper at home to tell him so.  How embarassing for me<br/>
to post to the list willy-nilly and report a box missing when I didn't<br/>
know what I was talking about.  It took me three times to achieve that<br/>
box and it was, and definitely still is, there!  <br/>
<br/>
I like to place letterboxes that are no-brainers, but that doesn't mean<br/>
everyone else does.  It might seem like you're looking in the right<br/>
place according to the clues, but so much of it is interpretation.  I<br/>
like to think my clues are straightforward, but one of my boxes in<br/>
particular, Mary Hill,  has been reported as missing several times only<br/>
to be found soon after.  <br/>
<br/>
You can do what you will with the database.  People can report or not<br/>
report.  It doesn't matter to me.  If someone wishes to make a report on<br/>
my LB's that's up to them, right or wrong.  If anyone wants a response<br/>
from me about a letterbox, though, they will need to do it through this<br/>
main list or my e-mail. It is doubtful that I will check the database<br/>
myself.  Just plain busy, lazy and untechnical.   <br/>
<br/>
And...I will report my finds, places and adventures as I please to this<br/>
list.  No one has to read them if they don't wish to.  It's a free<br/>
country.<br/>
<br/>
