Clackamas Community College<br/>
Oregon City, Clackamas County, Oregon<br/>

Directions to CCC: from 205, take #10 exit Park Place/Mollala (coming from <br/>
the north, follow the road as it curves around over the freeway; you’ll be <br/>
heading in the correct direction on 213; coming from the south, turn right <br/>
onto 213, and merge into one of the left lanes).  Drive up hill; at the light <br/>
at the top of the hill, turn left onto Beavercreek.  In about 1/2 mile, you’ll<br/>
 see the entrance to the college on your right. <br/>
<br/>
In addition to the academic offerings at CCC, the campus boasts the Haggart <br/>
Memorial Observatory (check out elc.clackamas.cc.or.us/haggart for open hours <br/>
and info about the telescope) and the John Inskeep Environmental Learning <br/>
Center, with its little pond and lots of ducks.  (None of the boxes are <br/>
located in either of these places.) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since these are the first letterboxes I’ve planted, I decided to explore the <br/>
subject of boxes.  Follow these clues to find the boxes in boxes:<br/>
<br/>
A big fat hint: Daorpoolsalguodehtmorftratsseulcxoblla.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Box #1<br/>
There’s a whole lotta rottin’ going on here!  Look at the big sign; to find <br/>
out how many posts you’ll be looking for, minus 8 from the ____ (percent) <br/>
number of all residential garbage in the metropolitan area that is yard <br/>
debris.<br/>
<br/>
To find out how many boulders you’ll be looking for, look for the sign about <br/>
the “Wood &amp; Wire ___-Bin Turning System.”<br/>
<br/>
To find the first box in a box, head south from that sign, and look for the <br/>
correct number of posts/boulders.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Box #2<br/>
There’s a buzz in the air, and love on the ground here.  <br/>
The sun rises over a place where cars are not allowed—but you are.<br/>
Go past the no-smoking tree.<br/>
Look for the next box in a box between the toes of a red cedar.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Box #3<br/>
The Jim Robbins Loop path parallels the road you’ve been following. Leaving <br/>
love behind you, walk on westward on the path.  Watch on your right for a <br/>
youngish cedar taking advantage of an old stump; the next box within a box is <br/>
hidden here.  Be gentle with this old stump—you only need to move aside a <br/>
piece of bark that’s been placed to cover the box, on the western side.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Box #4<br/>
Continuing on the path, watch on the right for a five-in-one cedar.  Hidden <br/>
in its midst is the fourth box’s box.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Box #5<br/>
Continue on the path.  When you see an oak that turns twin beside a fence, go <br/>
north and meander among the firs.<br/>
Caution!  Look between the third and fourth round boulders west of the orange <br/>
stick.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please read the disclaimer about reaching into crevices, holes, and hidden <br/>
places!<br/>
