Thanks for the reply. At the time my wife is not in a wheel chair. However<br/>
that may happen in the future. She has lupus and has had to take lots of<br/>
steroids which has caused weight gain, respiratory problems and tiredness.<br/>
She can do flat walks but hills really mess her up. She is also at the mercy<br/>
of the sun so we must plan all activities in the shade or early or late<br/>
evening. We have been to the diamond mine here in Arkansas and she made it<br/>
pretty good early and late. There is a state park that would be great for<br/>
hiding a letterbox in.<br/>
I think it would be great to add the designation of wheelchair accessible or<br/>
handicapped accessible to all directions (when appropriate). Great idea,<br/>
maybe others will join in.<br/>
Thanks and happy hunting,<br/>
Uncle Clay<br/>

  Hi Clay<br/>
<br/>
  I think it is a great idea to promote boxing for the disabled.  I<br/>
  assume your wife is wheelchair bound?<br/>
<br/>
  Talking in general terms for other wheelchair users.  Does this limit<br/>
  you to paved or boardwalk paths, or is packed dirt in the dry season<br/>
  an option?<br/>
<br/>
  Do you think a clue sheet that mentions "Disabled Friendly Acess"<br/>
  or "Wheelchair Friendly" is appropriate?  I can think of a few boxes<br/>
  here in Puget Sound Country that might qualify for such a rating most<br/>
  of the year.<br/>
<br/>
  I will try to include this designation when appropriate, and hope<br/>
  others will as well.  Now that we can edit our own clues sheets,<br/>
  perhaps some will go  back and re-think their clues shhet and<br/>
  designate the "wheelchair Friendly " ones.<br/>
<br/>
  Hoopoe<br/>
