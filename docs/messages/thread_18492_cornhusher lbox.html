                    <div class="plaintext-content">i'm in lincoln, ne for business and wanted to find the cornhusker <br/>
lbox..the first lbox in this state. i followed the clues, but i <br/>
believe that the little park has changed a little since the <br/>
placement in 1999.  has anyone found this box lately?<br/>
<br/>
tomorrow is my last chance to find this box.  any assistance would <br/>
be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
a funny thing happened though. i followed the clues with regard to <br/>
the bearings and paces, and came to "three steps".  the last clue is <br/>
to look under the steps to the left. so i did. lo and behold i saw a <br/>
plastic container! i was soo excited! so i pulled the box out only <br/>
to learn that the box was a geocache! good think i enjoy the <br/>
geocache hobby too.  so, at least my efforts weren't wasted.<br/>
