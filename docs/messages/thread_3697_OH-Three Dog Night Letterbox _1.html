letterbox in the Three Dog Night Series. I checked out four parks before<br/>
finding a suitable location. Then I had to wait for a gawker to leave.<br/>

Three Dog Night Letterbox #1<br/>
<br/>
November 13, 2001<br/>
<br/>
Ohio is the Buckeye State<br/>
All of us Buckeyes think our state is great!<br/>
<br/>
At the top of Ohio is Williams County<br/>
This is where you will find the bounty.<br/>
<br/>
George Bible Park is where it is at<br/>
Never heard of it? Imagine that!<br/>
<br/>
Look between Montpelier and Bryan<br/>
If you cant find it, just keep tryin.<br/>
<br/>
At the corner of Williams County Roads 13 and J<br/>
When you get here, you are on your way!<br/>
<br/>
The park entrance is out of sight<br/>
If you go too fast, miss it you might!<br/>
<br/>
Park your car and travel on foot<br/>
Youre getting closer to the loot!<br/>
<br/>
Walk around the chrome guardrail<br/>
Now you are almost on the trail!<br/>
<br/>
Walk to the sign that says Bible Park<br/>
You might miss it after dark.<br/>
<br/>
Turn to your left and walk 28 paces directly east<br/>
Youre getting very near the feast.<br/>
<br/>
Turn right at the flower bed<br/>
The prize you are seeking is straight ahead.<br/>
<br/>
30 paces to the south is a gnarled old tree<br/>
With gnarled roots; you are now home free!<br/>
<br/>
Carefully reach up inside<br/>
That is where the treasure will hide!<br/>
<br/>
