                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just like much else about this hobby and assemblage of your boxes, I <br/>
think it is a personal preference.<br/>
<br/>
I personally like to see boxes and stamps that have a kind of theme <br/>
appropriate to the location, i.e. either in keeping with the name, <br/>
history, activity, landscape, mood, etc.  It would seem this would be <br/>
particularly meaningful when later looking back through your log.  If <br/>
you are using purchased stamps, it can be a bit more difficult to <br/>
make it all work together since you are limited to what you can find <br/>
ready-to-buy.  Of course, if you are carving or have a stamp <br/>
commissioned, it is your choice!<br/>
<br/>
As I am putting together ideas for boxes and stamps, I am trying to <br/>
stick with themes for places that lend themself to a theme.  For <br/>
those that are just a pretty spot along a hiking trail in a woods <br/>
somewhere, it is a great opportunity to do a stamp that I've been <br/>
wanting to do but is just a nice design or graphic, or to create a <br/>
theme around a feeling or mood or even a favorite color or word!  In <br/>
this case, the box sets the theme and the stamp is in keeping with <br/>
this -- with the ideas people have been giving for containers, you <br/>
can really make the entire package work together, and turn a ho-hum, <br/>
non-specific location into a true treasure hunt!  That is where the <br/>
creativity comes in!<br/>
<br/>
I know some people like to put the name of the box or location on <br/>
their carved stamps and I like this particularly when the name is in <br/>
keeping with a landmark or historic site.  Others routinely put the <br/>
date on the stamp, which I have decided to do only for hitch hikers <br/>
and stamps that may be for a specific, dated event.<br/>
<br/>
I saw some cool containers yesterday at the local dollar store here <br/>
(Dollars &amp; Deals).  They were called beach capsules and are available <br/>
in the shape of a buoy (2 sizes - small one is about 4.5" long x 1" <br/>
diameter) and also something similar to a binoculars case (about 4.5" <br/>
x 3.5" x 1"), in several bright colors.  They are meant for <br/>
underwater use and have rubber seals and an attached nylon cord.  <br/>
This might be something that would work well in keeping with your <br/>
tropical fish theme.  If you are interested, e-mail me and I can send <br/>
you a picture and would even be willing to mail you one if you cannot <br/>
find these where you live.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents...  Am interested in what others think.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone feel strongly about this?  So far, I think only one of <br/>
the stamps <br/>
&gt; I found was not really specific to it's location.  Out of the boxes <br/>
I have <br/>
&gt; placed, three are very specific, one is generally related and the <br/>
last is my <br/>
&gt; hitchhiker which is a kangaroo.   Last I checked, kangaroos are not <br/>
&gt; necessarily indigenous to Maryland, but I loved how the stamp <br/>
turned out!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just carved a stamp of an aquarium fish - can't think where I <br/>
could place <br/>
&gt; it where it would make sense!  Maybe I could hide it IN an <br/>
aquarium... now <br/>
&gt; that might be fun!  hmmm....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, just wondering if it's good form to put random stamps in a <br/>
box...<br/>

stamp and a logbook in the box when I find it! Homemade stamps, store-<br/>
bought logbooks . . . None of that matters to me. I just want to <br/>
search, find, and stamp!<br/>
