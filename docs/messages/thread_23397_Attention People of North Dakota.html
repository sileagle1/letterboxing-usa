Since Gwen and I have salted a few areas I think planting a few <br/>
letterboxes in a boxless area can be a good thing as long as the <br/>
planter monitors the clues and updates them with any new information <br/>
that they might receive. We have planted in Arizona, Montana, Wyoming, <br/>
Oregon(that certainly wasn't boxless), and areas fairly distant in <br/>
California. Setting up a few boxes in a boxless area can encourage a <br/>
brand new boxer that hasn't found any letterboxes and has read about <br/>
letterboxing or has heard about it. I think the keys are "a few <br/>
letterboxes" and "monitoring" the clues.<br/>

Exactly. Maybe people in North Dakota read the Smithsonian too, but became discouraged when they only saw 3 boxes in the entire state! That's what happened to me. I was sent the article, looked up my area, and saw 3 boxes for all of Onondaga county. I knew nothing about planting and it didn't even occur to me that I was perfectly capable of planting an interesting box. I figured the hobby would get tedious  pretty quickly with so few boxes. So I set it aside. Imagine my surprise 5 years later when I check my area again?!?<br/>
<br/>
  Also, I have no intention of being the ONLY planter. I have invited others to join me in this. I don't think maintaining a couple of boxes will be a big deal..even if I  someday eventually turn them over to a local. Plenty of more seasoned boxers on here have them scattered across the country and I don't hear any complaints.<br/>

<br/>
Having been instrumental in seeding an area with boxes and nurturing an otherwise boxless/boxerless environment, I know both how rewarding and how demanding it can be.  Living in the area has been a key to the success for me.  On the other hand, I have also done this in an area I do not live or frequent as often (about once a year).  It has been extremely difficult to stay on top of those boxes and would be impossible without the gracious assistance of a couple newer boxers in that area and others who travel there periodically.  I don't think that people understand the amount of perseverance and hands-on participation it requires on a consistent basis until things take off in that area.  You asked for opinions and I was only offering what I had learned from personal experience.  <br/>
<br/>
As I said, if you feel you have this covered from afar or otherwise have a plan for monitoring the boxes, go for it!<br/>

  Well without giving too much away, it was NEVER my intent to drop into North Dakota, scatter some boxes about and leave.  I consider myself a very thoughtful and responsible boxer and I believe you could find others that agree.

  &gt; Recently, on the Atlasquest boards, I announced that I wanted to <br/>
  throw a party/event in Fargo, ND during May of 2007. I named <br/>
  it "Don't Forgo Fargo" and asked people to join me in a big planting <br/>
  party. I was amazed at how few boxes there were in your fair state ( <br/>
  3, I believe) and I wanted to help share some letterboxing <br/>
  brotherhood with you all.<br/>
  &gt;    <br/>
  &gt;   Some people expressed concern that they're weren't enough boxers <br/>
  interested in North Dakota and thought the boxes might languish for <br/>
  a long time before being visited. So I am wondering, is this true? <br/>
  Will this event be known as "Lock Wench's Folly?"<br/>
  &gt;    <br/>
  &gt;    Or, if they were planted...would you come?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, but I think even more discouraging for a new boxer than the lack of many boxes is seeking boxes that are not well maintained.  Over and over again we hear complaints on the list from newer boxers about going out for the first time and looking for a box, only to come up empty-handed.  Their frustration is only increased when they contact the placer to find out if the box is active and are told that they placer does not live in the area and cannot confirm the box one way or the other.  As people grow in the game and gain experience I think the missing box syndrome is more understood and not quite as discouraging, but to a new boxer and their family, it is often the make or break criteria as to whether they continue in the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
There is a fine line between planting boxes and making sure the boxes are actually available.  This is where is becomes not just a matter of planting boxes, but nurturing the boxing environment.  This is different than just dropping off a box as you pass through an area on vacation as Don was pointing out.<br/>
<br/>
The key will be getting involvement from boxers in that area and building a network of folks whom you can rely on to help monitor the boxes.  Good luck!<br/>

  Exactly. Maybe people in North Dakota read the Smithsonian too, but became discouraged when they only saw 3 boxes in the entire state! That's what happened to me. I was sent the article, looked up my area, and saw 3 boxes for all of Onondaga county. I knew nothing about planting and it didn't even occur to me that I was perfectly capable of planting an interesting box. I figured the hobby would get tedious  pretty quickly with so few boxes. So I set it aside. Imagine my surprise 5 years later when I check my area again?!?<br/>
<br/>
    Also, I have no intention of being the ONLY planter. I have invited others to join me in this. I don't think maintaining a couple of boxes will be a big deal..even if I  someday eventually turn them over to a local. Plenty of more seasoned boxers on here have them scattered across the country and I don't hear any complaints.<br/>

It's kind of suprising, but boxes off the beaten path don't really<br/>

I just always bring extra ziplock bags. Seems logical to me.<br/>

Oh so true, I have a letterbox (Arboretum) that has been found by at least 4 muggles - they've left notes in the log. Last week I went to check on it and it was sitting by the tree (it should have been inside the tree), right next to the trail. It's had over 40 visitors and it's still going strong after 4 years (planted April 2002). I'm completely amazed.<br/>
