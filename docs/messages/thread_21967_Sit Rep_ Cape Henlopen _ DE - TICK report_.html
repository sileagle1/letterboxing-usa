<br/>
	We explored Cape Henlopen which is a great park. Lots of trails for<br/>
bikes and hikes. Close to the beaches too.<br/>
<br/>
	We can confirm that the  "Cape Henlopen Tower" LB is missing! .<br/>
<br/>
	The second LB , "The Cape Henlopen Devil"  is well and in good shape. <br/>
There were many stamped in LBer's before us.  The coastal waters and<br/>
marshes were beautiful except for one thing...Lots of TICKS! ......Not<br/>
only the regular size ones but the very small ones , less than a tenth<br/>
the size of a match head. There were 5 on me after 24 hours and they are<br/>
really difficult to spot. <br/>
<br/>
********    Is there any thing that you can "put on" that can guard you<br/>
from them?   *****************<br/>
<br/>
There were no ticks on "Bud", maybe he was protected by the bike cart<br/>
that we pedal him around in?<br/>

"Cutters Outdoors" repels ticks along with mosquito's.  I seem to be <br/>
the mosquito magnet and put the stuff on like a thick heavy coat of <br/>
spray paint, works like a charm.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Right, Cutter or Deep Woods Off works OK. You want at least 25% DEET. <br/>
More is better as far as ticks are concerned and some of <br/>
the 'outdoorsman' brands have as much as 50%, but some people have a <br/>
skin sensitivity at that level. Best to keep it on clothing.<br/>
<br/>
Pyrethrum sprays work the best. This is for clothing only and should <br/>
not be applied to skin. WalMart Outdoors Dept. sells one under the <br/>
Permanone(sp) brand.<br/>
