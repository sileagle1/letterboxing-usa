Mansfield. I noticed an earlier posting about letterboxers missing <br/>
the first part of trail at My Fav. Actor.  We did also, and ended up <br/>
going to the lookout point, finding "The Hanging Hiker"--cute stamp, <br/>
then backtracking for Actor stamps and  some Musical stamps  Pine <br/>
Tree did not have yet.  We could not find #3) "Much Ado" of Actor <br/>
series.  Too soon it will be fall and the hunting through woods will <br/>
be easier. We Shall Return!!<br/>
