                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to share a caution about these. There is a planter in my area who has used <br/>
these in 9-10 boxes thus far. After they get some use [from lots of finders stamping and <br/>
looking/reading] the pad of paper detaches from the backing. In addition, since these are <br/>
not actually "bound" like a book, the pages themselves easily come dis-attached after too <br/>
many people have looked at the book and turned the pages. So the pages for the first few <br/>
finders were coming out when I have found these books. And the pages themselves are <br/>
very thin paper and stamps show thru on the other side. I think these are intended as <br/>
notepads, not as books with pages to remain inside them.<br/>
