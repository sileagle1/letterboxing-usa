IT SOUNDED LIKE A NEAT PASTIME SO WE FOUND THE WEBSITE AND STARTED <br/>
FINDING OUT INFORMATION AND CLUES.<br/>
    OUR FIRST BOX WE FOUND WAS PART OF THE CONCH REPUBLIC SERIES IN <br/>
THE FLORIDA KEYS, 3-25-07. THIS IS THE ONE NEAR LAYTON CITY IN THE <br/>
KEYS.  THE TRAIL WAS NEAT AND FINDING THE BOX WAS FUN.  EVEN THOUGH <br/>
IT WAS UNDER ABOUT 40 LBS. OF CORAL. THE CONTENTS WERE IN GOOD SHAPE, <br/>
ALTHOUGH THERE WAS SOME WATER IN IT. MOSTLY THE INK PAD WAS WET. WE <br/>
DRIED IT OUT AND REPLACED THE PLASTIC BAGS.<br/>
  3-26-07 FOUND TWO TODAY. WE ARE ON A ROLL.<br/>
SONGBIRD BOX - AT DOVE CREEK HAMMOCKS IN KEY LARGO. PROBABLY THE MOST <br/>
DIFFICULT SO FAR. WEEDS AND BRUSH HAVE GROWN UP KNEE HIGH OR BETTER <br/>
AND CLUES WERE HARD TO FIND. ESPECIALLY THE LIMESTONE ROCK.  THIS <br/>
CONTAINER WAS ALSO WET. THE LOG BOOK IS VERY DAMP AND THE PAGES ARE <br/>
STUCK TOGETHER. WE DRIED IT OUT THE BEST WE COULD AND REPLACED IT. <br/>
SAND SPURS AND STICKERS ARE VERY BAD IN THIS AREA.<br/>
  3-26-07 LOST TREASURE OF THE SPANISH GALLEONS - THIS WAS A REAL <br/>
TREAT. THE BOX IS IN "THE DAGNEY JOHSON KEY LARGO HAMMOCK BOTANICAL <br/>
STATE PARK". WHAT BEAUTIFUL PLACE! IT WAS WORTH THE DRIVE AND WALK. <br/>
FOUND THE BOX AND IT IS IN GOOD CONDITION.<br/>
    WE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO "JOHN PENNEKAMP STATE PARK" IN A FEW <br/>
DAYS. THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO THERE. THEN ON TO KEY WEST NEXT WEEK. <br/>
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW DOWN THERE.<br/>
    WE WILL BE IN THE KEYS FOR ABOUT TWO MORE WEEKS IF THERE IS <br/>
ANYTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT A BOX LET US KNOW.<br/>
