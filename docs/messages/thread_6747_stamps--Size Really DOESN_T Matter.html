I have one letterbox log book which is like 2" X 1 1/4" -- in that situation, you could imprint a cropped view of your stamp -- art neuvo.  Sounds like your stamp would fit most logs -- just write on the backside of your stamp's page if it doesn't?<br/>
<br/>
You have an opportunity for some creative stamping, I'd say!<br/>

&gt; I also have a general opinion question...  I spend many, many hours carving<br/>
&gt; a celtic design stamp with the idea of using it as a box stamp some day.  I<br/>
&gt; liked it enough that I want to use it as my personal stamp; however, it's<br/>
&gt; quite big... it's a circle measuring 2 3/4" across.  I used it in the ASA<br/>
&gt; pond letterbox in Peacedale (RI), and it and my dog's stamp pretty much<br/>
&gt; filled the log's page (3x5 index card) with just enough room left for our<br/>
&gt; names and date.  I noticed that just about everyone else had either a small<br/>
&gt; commercial stamp or an eraser sized carved stamp.  Since any other people I<br/>
&gt; may go boxing with will spill onto a second page of the <br/>
&gt; log, will I be<br/>
&gt; considered a space-hog if I continue using this stamp?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for any feedback.<br/>
