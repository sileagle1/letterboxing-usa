                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well Sir B,   Your comments sparked my interest in exploring <br/>
geocaching so I took a few minutes from a slow night at work to check <br/>
out the site.  AND I agree with you whole heartedly!!!<br/>
<br/>
I see a lot of folks on that site trying to make caches into boxes <br/>
and incorporate both. I can also see where someone would take a stamp <br/>
instead of some of the other "trinkets" left in the caches. While I'm <br/>
not opening the Pandora's box of caching vs boxing, I will say that I <br/>
don't see Heidi and I geocaching anytime soon : ) <br/>
<br/>
We treasure the walk that each voyage brings us on. We also try to <br/>
make the hike memorable when we place our letterboxes. Looking <br/>
through our finds makes us remember certain things about each hike <br/>
that we associate with each stamp...i.e. the simplicity of a dilemma, <br/>
the view from Canopy Rock, the blood thristy hummingbird sized <br/>
mosquitos at Dancing Men (still itching!).  <br/>
<br/>
Ok enough rambling.... I think you can extrapolate what I just <br/>
mentioned to grasp our thoughts on caching. Again, I'm not on a cach-<br/>
bash here : ) <br/>
<br/>
Anyways.... please DO include a note on your letterbox about it not <br/>
being a geocache. If it gets vandalized, well thats part of the <br/>
sport. We have copies of all the images we place....most are <br/>
scanned...and they all can be recarved. <br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails!!!!<br/>
<br/>
