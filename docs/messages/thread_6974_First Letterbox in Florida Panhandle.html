Hidden August 13, 2002 by "Dave P" in Tallahassee, Florida (Leon County).<br/>
<br/>
I have been geocaching since March 2001 and hid the first geocache in this <br/>
area (go to www.geocaching.com for more information).  I decided to give <br/>
Letterboxing a try and found my first one in Atlanta, Georgia this past <br/>
weekend with my wife, Ellen (I learned how to use a compass while on the <br/>
hunt).  I have been planning to hide this one for a while and found a good <br/>
spot for it.  With the tree cover, it would be hard to find a geocache, so a <br/>
letterbox works real well here.<br/>
<br/>
I named this Letterbox for the local terrain and my 'mantra' while riding <br/>
mountain and road bikes in the area.  If you don't love the hills, they will <br/>
defeat you.  This search will take you on a short up-hill hike (less than <br/>
one-mile round-trip).  The letterbox is a sandwich sized, plastic container.  <br/>
It contains a handmade stamp (my first one), an inkpad, a logbook, and a pen. <br/>
 Please e-mail me at david1959@juno.com to let me know of your find.<br/>
<br/>
The letterbox is hidden in San Luis Park on San Luis Road at San Pedro Ave.  <br/>
My siblings and I played in these woods with our friends while growing up in <br/>
nearby San Luis Ridge in the early to mid 1970s, long before the park was <br/>
here.  There is no charge to enter the park.  The trails are well defined but <br/>
sandy and crossed by lots of tree roots.  Stick to the trails until the final <br/>
direction.  Wear comfortable walking shoes and bring insect repellant.  <br/>
Beware of poison ivy and local wildlife.  There is a water fountain and <br/>
bathroom in the park but you may want to bring a water bottle for the hike.  <br/>
Don't forget your compass and your stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Start off at the tic-tac-toe game at the playground.  Take a bearing of 10 <br/>
degrees and walk 85 paces.  I am a 5'9" tall male taking normal sized steps.  <br/>
A pace is counted on a footfall of either foot, i.e. two paces are counted <br/>
each time the right foot hits the ground.  You will have to cross several <br/>
obstacles here.  You will see a light pole.  From the light pole, take a <br/>
bearing of 30 degrees.  Follow the path uphill. <br/>
<br/>
 You will come to a pine tree in the middle of a fork in the path.  From this <br/>
tree, head 0 degrees north, following the trail until you come to a bench.  <br/>
You may take a short break here.  From the bench, take a bearing of 320 <br/>
degrees and follow the path until you get to a "T" in the trail.<br/>
<br/>
At the "T", take a bearing of 280 degrees and follow the trail to a second <br/>
bench.    Don't take a break now, you are almost at your goal.  From the <br/>
middle of the three-way intersect in front of the bench, take a bearing of <br/>
340 degrees and walk 50 paces, sticking to the trail.  Turn to a bearing of <br/>
100 degrees and take 8 paces off the trail.  Be careful of the flora and <br/>
fauna here.<br/>
<br/>
The letterbox is at the base of the tree, covered with large, dark stones and <br/>
leaves.  After leaving your stamp's imprint and any message you may want to <br/>
write, and stamping your book with my "Love The Hills" stamp, please seal <br/>
everything back up and replace the letterbox just as you found it.  Cover it <br/>
up well so that it won't be found by accident.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you had fun.  Please e-mail me at david1959@juno.com to let me know of <br/>
your find.<br/>
