question <br/>
<br/>
     "Would you feel more comfortable on a longer hike with a series <br/>
      of boxes to bring you along?"<br/>
<br/>
Poll is on my blog  http://bakersoutdoors.blogspot.com/<br/>
<br/>
I am thrilled that so many of you have let me know how you feel on this <br/>
question and you have left some real constructive comments.<br/>
<br/>
I am definatly going to change the way I hide boxes in wooded or wild <br/>
areas and I am going to take a little more time in my preface to the <br/>
clues to describe the terrain and difficulty of the hike in more detail.<br/>
<br/>
I have three boxes that are in wilder areas. One is a 2.5 mile hike to <br/>
the box. As an example of what I plan on doing, based on the comments I <br/>
have received, is to discribe the trail in the same detail as a trail <br/>
guide and to hide boxes at important points (Not too many) or describe <br/>
landmarks a little better so that the boxer can use that to find their <br/>
way there the woods and more importantly to feel more comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
With the box that is a 2.5 mile hike, I start the box clues at a trail <br/>
intersection, that you would need a trail guide to find. So far in a <br/>
year only one boxer has found it. I think that instead of finding new <br/>
places to hide boxes this fall and next spring, I am going to work on <br/>
these wilder areas to try and tame them a little. This one, the 2.5 <br/>
mile one, is one that I really can have some fun setting up.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the poll is still open on my blog <br/>
http://bakersoutdoors.blogspot.com/ if you would like to add your 2 <br/>
cents. I really apprecaite the comments, as both have been very useful.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much,<br/>
