also).  I've been trying to figure out how to work it into the sport, so...<br/>

There are 23 lines.  I thought it would be fun to have 23 different boxers <br/>
each carve a stamp with one line on it, and send them out Across the <br/>
Universe :) as Hitchhikers or Travellers.  Which makes more sense?<br/>
<br/>
I'll get the ball rolling by saying email me offlist and I'll "assign" lines <br/>
to avoid duplication.<br/>
<br/>
It'll be up to whoever receives the various stamps to stamp them in the <br/>
correct order in their log books!  Fortunately there are websites for <br/>
Beatles lyrics, for those of you who are deprived of the liner notes.<br/>

<br/>
I guess we're forgetting about _Mercury Smile_ by Treble Charger :-) (from<br/>
the "mabye it's me" album).  Fantastic album, BTW.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, couldn't resist ...<br/>

&gt; What is a Traveller and how does it differ from a Hitchhiker?<br/>
<br/>
Travelers are found on people (their creator) (and travel with them <br/>
in the field, and sometimes require a riddle, task, etc. for their <br/>
holder to reveal them); hitchhikers are found in other boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Some American boxers, however, use the term "traveler" when I think<br/>
they mean what everyone (in America) would also call a "hitchhiker".<br/>
