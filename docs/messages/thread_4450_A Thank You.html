<br/>
While researching updates to letterboxes in Western MA, I found a <br/>
message posted by Bonnie Sennott asking us to express our <br/>
appreciation to the webmasters of this site.  Duly reminded, I wish <br/>
to say "Thank you" for all your hard work and effort in maintaining <br/>
this site.  I was amazed at how quickly the letterbox clues I <br/>
submitted for the Four Ponds Letterbox was added to the Clues page. <br/>
And being able to search the archives for problems or changes with <br/>
existing or missing letterboxes is a terrific aid in avoiding <br/>
unnecessary disappointment.  At the same time I realize that new <br/>
clues, updates, etc. can not always be processed as fast. So thanks <br/>
again - and may you have a 'lovely' Valentine's Day!<br/>

September," I've had a lot less time to enjoy the woods, hills, and <br/>
open spaces, but keeping up vicariously with my friends in <br/>
letterboxing by staying active with the site is a good substitute.<br/>

See you out there!<br/>
