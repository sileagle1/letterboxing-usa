<div>    Just thought you might like to know 
that someone has visited your letterbox at Lion's Head.  Apparently a bunch 
of kids found it first while looking for firewood.  They all wrote in it 
but put it back, thank goodness.  We were up there the day after 
Thanksgiving with family in the area.  I'd been up there many times as a 
kid, but it's been awhile since then.  What a view.  We can see 
our family farm and even make out the houses.</div>
<div>    In your instructions you mentioned this 
being "another for the Appalachian Trail".  Is there a page with other AT 
letterboxes listed?  I haven't seen any other AT clues anywhere in 
Connecticut.  We're thinking about putting one up on Belter's 
Bump.</div>
<div>    Anyway, thanks for a reason to get out 
and hike up there!</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow! I'm so happy to hear that the Lion's Head letterbox has been visited!<br/>
Thank goodness for well meaning kids! I suppose that is a frequently<br/>
visited area up there. However, I thought my placemement was a little more<br/>
out of the way. Oh well, at least it's still there! I had a lump in my<br/>
throat as I read your email in hopes that it wasn't a report of it being<br/>
missing. I kinda like the stamp I carved for that one. Hmmm, actually, I<br/>
guess I assumed that there were other letterboxes on the Appalachian Trail.<br/>
Honestly, I don't know if there is a page for them or not. Although I do<br/>
know of a few up at Sherburne Pass up in Vermont where the AT and the Long<br/>
Trail split so I can't take credit for the first on the AT at all. The<br/>
Sherburne Pass letterboxes are quite a hoot too!<br/>
