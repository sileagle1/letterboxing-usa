As I said I am going to go look for it again.  The "Recycle a Can for <br/>
the Pelican Man" sign has completely peeled all of its lettering off <br/>
except for the "Can".  There is a lot of traffic back there and some <br/>
construction.  The sanctuary people park their cars on the grass <br/>
around the <br/>
palm trees to the right of the sign, perhaps because of the <br/>
construction.  But it still might be possible to plant the box in the <br/>
palm tree <br/>
cluster, though I would recommend saying in the clues that that is <br/>
where <br/>
to look instead of all around the area.<br/>

am planting a box in a park very nearby.  I'll try to replant yours <br/>

<br/>
The stamp I carved is more appropriate for your box so I may carve a <br/>
different subject for mine.  If you send a new stamp mine would make <br/>
a good hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
So sad about the missing stamp.  I am still in the stage of carving <br/>
outlines on erasers for stamps.  I hope to think they turn out pretty <br/>
well though.<br/>

stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the information needed to adjust the clues.  I just ate <br/>
Thanksgiving dinner so I am not my most coherent.<br/>
<br/>
The "Recycle a Can for the Pelican Man" sign has all the lettering <br/>
torn off but the word "Can".  The recycling center is still there <br/>
though and the road has a sign to the "Recycling Center" that <br/>
includes the Pelican logo.  The site is the staff entrance at the <br/>
rear of the Pelican Man Sanctuary.  To the right, as in the original <br/>
clues, there are some clusters of palm trees.  Look in the first big <br/>
cluster of palm trees, close the staff entrance. The letterbox is <br/>
hidden under some bark and leaves in the middle of the cluster.<br/>
