                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think DMS' post demonstrated his passion for<br/>
letterboxing rather than harshness.  He is a great<br/>
contributor to letterboxing, someone I aspire to be<br/>
like in this hobby.<br/>
<br/>
The cold hard truth is - we put those boxes out there<br/>
and someone is going to put their hands on them.  We<br/>
may not like how they bag them back up, we might not<br/>
like that they stamped the back of a page, we might<br/>
not agree with a HH they dropped in our box, we might<br/>
not like that they didn't hide them back well, but we<br/>
invited them to touch and feel our artwork and we<br/>
should respect the fact that they gave us the gift of<br/>
a visit and communicated that by making their mark.<br/>
<br/>
When I read his post, I finally understood what it is<br/>
I truly love about letterboxing - it IS a dynamic art<br/>
form.  I tried geocaching, and while I can see why<br/>
some folks like it, it wasn't for me.  It was sterile<br/>
and the "high" of the find was pretty short-lived.  <br/>
<br/>
When we pack up a box and set out to plant it, there<br/>
is a reason for what we've put in the box and a reason<br/>
for why we put it where we do (at least in my case<br/>
there is).  That's our gift.  We set it in its perfect<br/>
condition into its hiding place and walk away from it.<br/>
 Before the day is out, the elements set to work on<br/>
it.  Wouldn't it be interesting to set a hidden camera<br/>
on a box and video "The secret life of a letterbox"?<br/>
<br/>
The first finder comes and stamps in and immediately<br/>
changes the art of the box - now there are two images<br/>
in it.  And not only that, but the box has changed the<br/>
dynamic of the finder's logbook too!  And so the<br/>
interaction begins.  <br/>
<br/>
After reading his post, it made me realize I should<br/>
treat my logbook like the work of art that it is (it<br/>
looks like it's been carried around in a backpack - oh<br/>
wait!  It has!).  I should take a little more time<br/>
stamping in to a box.  I should think a little harder<br/>
about the logs I put into my boxes.  If I'm actively<br/>
participating in an art form, I need to remember that<br/>
I am an artist, whether I'm carving or stamping or<br/>
placing.<br/>
<br/>
I've always maintained that for me it's all about the<br/>
experience, but looking at it after reading DMS' post,<br/>
I have to admit that I haven't given due appreciation<br/>
to the artistry of the stamps and the logbooks at the<br/>
end of the journey.  Not saying I don't appreciate<br/>
them at all, because I really do, but what's in that<br/>
box IS important!  <br/>
