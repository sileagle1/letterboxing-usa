<br/>
Only two days from when I first heard about letterboxing, I had <br/>
found four of Spring Chick's boxes, carved my first two stamps, make <br/>
a soft-wrap dual-log book, placed my own first letterbox, posted it <br/>
to the LbNa website, and created quickie little letterboxing website <br/>
for myself. http://home.comcast.net/~bindlestiff_boxer/  <br/>

As of this afternoon, I had privately emailed Spring Chick a status <br/>
report on the boxes I found, two of which I did some minor <br/>
upkeep/repairs to, have gotten a nice reply back from her already, <br/>
planned out a whole themed series of letterboxes I want to plant, <br/>
and carved the first four stamps for said series.<br/>

Wha-d'ya think?  I am Letter-Boxer material or simply suffering from <br/>

there is no cure, but luckily, it's GOOD for you health! <big grin=""> Welcome<br/>
to Letterboxing! Unfortunately you came in during one of the little 'flame<br/>
ups' about the database <subject dispute="" du="" jour="" of="">. We really are a great<br/>
bunch of people, honest!<br/>
<br/>
Great job on the website and the stamps! I love the knots, you did a really<br/>
great job on them. I visit the Houghton Lake area each Summer, any chance<br/>
you are near there? I'm guessing that if you found Spring Chick's boxes,<br/>
that you are farther West.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you many happy trails, great weather, good company and oh yeah, Happy<br/>
Thanksgiving!!<br/>
If you have any questions, I'd be happy to share what I know.<br/>
