                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey folks - I sent out a mass email today to everyone who moved along <br/>
one of the critters and emailed me with an update. I had to wipe out my <br/>
hard drive thanks to a computer virus and I know I lost a few of your <br/>
names and email addresses, so if you didn't receive an email from me <br/>
regarding the Carrier Pigeon PLB and feel you should have, please <br/>
contact me at hitchhikerrace @ sbcglobal . net. (If you have already <br/>
received a prize plb from me because one of your racers won, then you <br/>
received this with it, and don't need to contact me.)<br/>
<br/>
These are some that I know for sure I lost contact info:<br/>
<br/>
Wild Rose (you had Purple Turtle)<br/>
Elizabeth (you had Blue Cat)<br/>
Arttrekker (you had Yellow Kangaroo)<br/>
Sarah (you had Pink Pig, and I haven't been able to contact you)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!  -Q<br/>
