<br/>
Kerblammo and I were up in Portland over the weekend.  We happily <br/>
solved the clues to Turtle Soup and were able to capture our very <br/>
first multi-colored stamp...a beauty!<br/>
<br/>
Saturday we made a valiant, and somewhat desperate set of attempts on <br/>
the Spirit of Dartmoor box.  I am completely willing to bet (being <br/>
from Las Vegas and all) that we solved the clues correctly and were <br/>
in the right spot, or at least the right vicinity, but alas, we came <br/>
up empty-handed(Ryan, does this sound familiar?). Without giving away <br/>
where we were, I can say that the folks we encountered knew nothing <br/>
about the box and, in fact, considered us a little looney.  I'm sure <br/>
that's a letterboxing first.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday we had planned to hike in Washington Park, but my parents (who <br/>
were also visiting for a family wedding) wanted to hang out, so we <br/>
settled for more modest, but fun, hunts in the area and picked <br/>
up "Puff the Magic Dragon" in the Fate of Childhood series, "Winking <br/>
Eagle" and "Packy's Place."  I had hoped for more scores, but the <br/>
time with my folks was precious too.  My Dad really seems to enjoy <br/>
going on these odd little hunts with me.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to get back to Portland someday and do it right,<br/>
