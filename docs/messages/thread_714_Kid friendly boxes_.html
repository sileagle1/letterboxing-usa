fundimental part of the week long day camps.  (Southern NH, near Nashua).<br/>
The day camps were outdoor rock climbing and adventure theme.<br/>
<br/>
As a break from rock climbing we'd take out the letterboxing gear.  The we <br/>
would have stamp carving for arts and crafts.  Later we would have map and <br/>
compas technique for outdoor skills class.  Then put it all together a day or <br/>
so later by seeking pre-hidden boxes as an incentive for a hike in the woods. <br/>
 (it seems ya gotta do what ever you can to get kids motiviated to go in the <br/>
woods!)<br/>
<br/>
We dad pre-placed four easy boxes with cool, wacky stamps or themes related <br/>
to the area where we were hiking.  The kids collected impressions from each <br/>
to add to their own passports.<br/>
<br/>
With 16 to 20 campers it was impossible to hide each camper's new box.  <br/>
However, detailed instructions on all aspects of the hobby were given to each <br/>
camper / family on the last day, along with a complete box to hide with <br/>
family later on. (including completed stamp of varying artistic quality, ink <br/>
pad, simple passport and Glad-Ware container to hold all).<br/>
<br/>
It was a hit with most of the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I'd be happy to share my experiences with anyone who might want to consider <br/>
letterboxing with a group of kids.<br/>
<br/>
I also have clues for four boxes in the Nashua, NH area.  E-mail me for the <br/>
clues until which time I get them published properly.<br/>
<br/>
May be at the Killington meet in Nov.  Still undecided.<br/>
Cheers everybody!<br/>

would love to see you in Killington and hear of your experiences first-hand!  Do you know if any of those campers have successfully hidden their box?  Sounds like it was a great camp.  Nice work<br/>
