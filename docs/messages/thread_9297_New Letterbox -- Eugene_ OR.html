placed the "Mount Pisgah Letterbox" near Eugene, OR, in Lane County.<br/>
<br/>
Rumor has it that the top Mount Pisgah offers a great view of the <br/>
surrounding area.  However, when I went up there, the fog was so <br/>
thick I could hardly see 100 feet ahead of me!  Maybe another day <br/>
will treat me better . . .<br/>
<br/>
On a brighter note, my stamp carving skills are slowing getting <br/>
better.  This stamp is a notable improvement over my previous stamps!<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead:  From I-5, either north or southbound, take exit <br/>
189.  Exits parallel I-5 until 30th Avenue. Turn onto Franklin <br/>
toward Texaco station. Turn right after Texaco station (I believe <br/>
there was a County Parks Sign at this turn).  Go a quarter of a mile <br/>
and make a left onto Seavey Loop Road.  Follow Seavey Loop about 2 <br/>
miles.  Cross one-lane bridge and go straight into the Mount Pisgah <br/>
Arboretum.  Parking lots are about an 1/8 of a mile with ample free <br/>
parking.  <br/>
<br/>
To the box:  Start on the trail heading up the mountaint.  Stay <br/>
going straight on the main wide path and ignore the smaller ones <br/>
that branch off of the main summit trail.  Along the way, you'll <br/>
come to a couple of trail junctions.  Just follow the signs to the <br/>
summit.  When you get to the top, there will be some sort of bronze <br/>
map of the surrounding area.  From there, go roughly 200 paces <br/>
further down the trail.  At this point you will see a cluster of <br/>
deciduous trees, all by themselves, about 100 paces (I didn't <br/>
measure this one) off the trail to the east.  From the middle of <br/>
these trees, head 25 paces at 140 degrees to a small cluster of <br/>
rocks.  The box is hidden in these rocks.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
<br/>
Barry and his letterboxing understudy, Justin<br/>
