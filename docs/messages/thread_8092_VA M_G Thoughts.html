amusingly stated already by other attendees.<br/>
<br/>
For me personally, it was one of the best weekends I've had in a long <br/>
time. I have lost count of the number of times I have pulled out my <br/>
now-bulging logbook and leafed through the stamped pages. Everyone was <br/>
so cool and friendly. And Mother Nature looked kindly on us after all. <br/>
<br/>
It's official. Rivah City is a fab place for letterboxing now! I think <br/>
we should alter the official city slogan from "Historic Richmond <br/>
Region: Easy to Love" to "Historic Richmond Region: Easy to <br/>
Letterbox"! I mean, we did that with the official state slogan on an <br/>
HH: "Virginia Is for Lovers" became "Virginia Is for Lovers. And <br/>
Boxers."<br/>
<br/>
Again, much props to those who organized and attended in both body and <br/>
spirit.<br/>
