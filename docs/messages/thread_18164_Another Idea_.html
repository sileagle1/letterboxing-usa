<br/>
There was just a discussion in our NE area talk list about the first <br/>
letterbox in CT. That got me to thinking . . .<br/>
<br/>
What would you think about having the first letterbox in each state, <br/>
linked to it's clues, all in one place? I will be glad to add and <br/>
maintain it as a subpage to my website, but need help with the <br/>
research.<br/>
<br/>
Please email me offlist letterboxes that you are sure are the first <br/>
in the state and I will compile and post.<br/>
<br/>
Any takers? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

it under good authority that the 'letterbox' listed is actually a <br/>
hybrid (gasp!) geocache, and to add INSULT to INJURY, it has a store-<br/>
bought stamp.  Nope, the Piedmont Park letterbox is the first REAL <br/>
letterbox in Georgia, and it's still there at last check.  Of course, <br/>
I did hide that box, so I may be arguing this point for no other <br/>
reason than my self-glory.  ;o)  But then, I do have several first-<br/>
finds for entire countries, so why should I care about having the <br/>
first placed box in the state of Georgia?<br/>
<br/>
In other news, I've managed to nab the first boxes in the states of <br/>
California, Oregon, and Washington.  I unwittingly missed Max Patch <br/>
when I hiked through the area not realizing there was a letterbox <br/>
there--much less the first letterbox in North Carolina and the first <br/>
one entered on the LbNA website (I think).  It's shameful I missed <br/>
it, but alas, I did.  *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many "first boxes" Wanda and Pete have managed to get.  <br/>
Out west it's a bit more difficult to rack up the counts since our <br/>
states are SOOOO big, but sheeze, in New England it would be a cinch!<br/>

<br/>
I saw on Silent Doug's list that a series in Wendell are listed as <br/>
Massachusett's first LBs.  But I have a question:<br/>
<br/>
Jay and I found "The Birdhouse" in Needham and we saw on the clues <br/>
sheet that we printed off the website that it was placed December <br/>
31st, 1969.  I have NO CLUE if that is true or not, but just thought <br/>
I would mention it.  Maybe someone else knows!<br/>

A 1969 date means that the box was transferred to the new database from the <br/>
old site and there was no info on the date that the box was planted -- it's <br/>
the default system date for the database and is meaningless beyond that.<br/>

entered.  Since everyone that I have spoken to puts the beginnings of<br/>
Letterboxing as starting in the mid to late 80's at the earliest, then 1969<br/>
must be a database error.  Of course, I could be completely wrong and not<br/>
know my butt from a hole in the ground!  (GRIN!!))<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Well - I had another idea. Sue thinks I'm crazy but after almost 30 <br/>
years of marriage, nothing really surprises her anymore!<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to devote a page on our website for your individual first <br/>
box - that initial find that got you started.<br/>
<br/>
We can do this through email - just send me your trail name, State in <br/>
which you live, the box name, State in which it's located &amp; the date, <br/>
including the year.<br/>
<br/>
I think we all may get a kick out of learning everyone's first box as <br/>
well as when and where it was. Be advised: if you email me, I will <br/>
post this info on the website so if you are not interested in having <br/>
this info on a website, please do not respond. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! [I know I am!!! ;-)]<br/>
