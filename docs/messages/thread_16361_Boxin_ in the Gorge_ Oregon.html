So far I still haven't gotten over the gratitude for letterboxing <br/>
getting me out into the beautiful Columbia Gorge.  I set out today <br/>
for the Wahkeena Falls and Fairy Falls letterboxes.  I never found <br/>
Fairy Falls.  At least I couldn't tell where to look from the trail.  <br/>
I'm wondering just how subjective this rule of (paraphrasing <br/>
here) "no trample" is.  <br/>
I'm sorry I missed the stamp if it is anywhere near as pretty as <br/>
these falls.  The silver water fans out over thousands of layers and <br/>
levels; substance to shimmer. Gleaming droplets cling coyly to the <br/>
saturated green moss.<br/>
Chewy, my 11 year old Rottweiler, is a little tuckered and he cares <br/>
nothing for the falls.  He guards the trail.  He's pissed I didn't <br/>
share my bagel.  <br/>
I'm so thankful for the blessing of this lovely day.  Almost <br/>
completely at peace.  Chewy looks so intently down the trail, my only <br/>
worry is someone will surprise me-- and they did!  But no worries.  A <br/>
couple guys from SF, one taking the other's picture while he grins <br/>
cheesily in front of the falls sign: "Fairy".:)<br/>
It seems to me the whole of Wahkeena falls begins from Fairy and just <br/>
keeps going till the parking lot.  We rush down the trail, inspired <br/>
by the river and a spunky Irish Setter in front of us.  We soon catch <br/>
up to them and learn they are on a treasure hunt of their own, of <br/>
sorts.  Apparently, when the retaining walls for the trail were <br/>
built, the workers drilled holes into the large stones and cemented <br/>
coins into them.  The Irish Setter's friends had found 3 out of a <br/>
possible 7, I think.  <br/>
So, there are many reasons to hike the Wahkeena Falls trail.  I hope <br/>
to get to Angel's Rest next time.  Thanks to a box being at the top, <br/>
it will probably be sooner, than later.  :)  And next time, I <br/>
remember to bring that stamp I carved.  My first one turned out <br/>
pretty good, if I do say so myself.  Course I am tempted to put that <br/>
one in a box of my own, at the bottom of the damnation creek trail <br/>
outside Cresent City.  Heh heh heh.<br/>
