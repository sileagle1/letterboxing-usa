Box Name:  Hole In The Wall<br/>
Nearest Town: La Push<br/>
County: Gray's Harbor<br/>
location: hole-in-the-wall, Rialto Beach, WA<br/>
hike: moderate (1.5 mi if low tide, 2.0 and more difficult if high tide)<br/>
clues: realatively easy.<br/>
<br/>
 From Hwy 101, north or south,take the 110 west.  (Also called La Push <br/>
Road)  Drive 7.6 miles to Mora Road. Turn right and continue to the <br/>
Rialto Beach Parking Area, 4.8 miles.<br/>
<br/>
Park in the Day Use parking area.  To the North, find the rest rooms and <br/>
the information kiosk.  Follow the one trail (marked with a sign to the <br/>
picnic area) and continue on the walkway as it makes a 90-degree turn. <br/>
Stop at the sign about the wildlife (we saw commorants, otters, and <br/>
maybe a sea lion...), and look to your left.  See the circular sign <br/>
nailed to the tree?  It's black, red, and white -- memorize it.<br/>
<br/>
Go out onto the beach and take a right.  Walk for 1.5 miles, across <br/>
Elinor Creek and past several huge stone monoliths, until you reach Hole <br/>
In The Wall.  (You'll know it because there is, literally, a huge hole <br/>
you can walk through.)<br/>
<br/>
Now, if it's low tide, this is easy:  Climbing on the rocks, go through <br/>
the hole to the beach beyond.  It's a popular camping site, you'll <br/>
probably have company.  Walk on down the beach, away from the hole <br/>
until, to your right, you see the sign I had you memorize back at the <br/>
trailhead.  Go over toward it.  You'll see four huge stairs.  Climb to <br/>
the top of them, but don't take the extra two steps to the trail.  On <br/>
your right is a log parallel to the stairs.  Under this log, at the side <br/>
closest to the sign, is the box, hidden under some bark and sticks.<br/>
<br/>
If it's high tide, you've got your work cut out for you.  Facing the <br/>
cliff, look to your right and the forest.  There's that sign I had you <br/>
memorize.  It marks the overland trail, which, in this case, leads you <br/>
STRAIGHT UP THE CLIFF and over to the other side.  Steel your resolve <br/>
and head on over.  Once you get there, there will be another one of <br/>
those round signs next to some rough stairs that can take you down to <br/>
the beach again.  At the top of these stairs, to your left if you're <br/>
facing the beach, is a log that's parallel to the stairs.  At the side <br/>
closest to the path you just came from and nearest to the second round <br/>
sign, is the box, hidden under some bark and sticks.<br/>
<br/>
This is a well-used area.  Please use extreme caution when removing or <br/>
replacing the box, making sure it's well hidden.  And watch the surf <br/>
around dusk -- the sea otters come in and bob along the waves on their <br/>
backs, cracking up dinner on their bellies.  It's an amazing sight.<br/>
