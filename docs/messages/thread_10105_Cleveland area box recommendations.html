                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was in Cleveland this fall and found most of the boxes in the area <br/>
at that time.  A couple of the easier ones (shorter distance and <br/>
relatively flat hike) are Bradley Woods and Huntington Reservation.  <br/>
Both should be findable even in the snow.<br/>
<br/>
Black Walnut (aka Nuts) is a short distance but up a steep hill, <br/>
which may not be too feasible in the snow -- this one was also <br/>
missing the log book when I was there, but it may have been replaced <br/>
since then.  Just Above Par and Parker's Ranch were both great hikes, <br/>
but a bit longer and some hills -- would depend on the weather, <br/>
especially Parker's Ranch (this was my favorite hike though).<br/>
<br/>
French Creek, Punderson Park and Burton's Log Cabin were all longer <br/>
hikes with some moderate hills.  Burton's Log Cabin begins with a <br/>
walk through town, but then heads into a creepy, muddy part of the <br/>
woods.  I was the first one who had been there even though it had <br/>
been in place several months.<br/>
<br/>
Don't bother with Letterbox on the Ridge because it is a very steep <br/>
climb and a treacherous walk along the ridge -- not a good idea with <br/>
small children or in slippery conditions.  Also this one may be <br/>
missing as I looked over, under, etc...  and never did find it.  <br/>
Others also have noted problems finding it.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are a few other boxes that I did not do.  Hope this <br/>
helps!<br/>
