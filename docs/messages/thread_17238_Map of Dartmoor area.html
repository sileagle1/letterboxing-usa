                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, I know I have far exceeded my 1 post per hour limit, but I have a question about the location and area surrounding Dartmoor.  I've looked up, but I'm not getting exactly what I need.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to figure out where Dartmoor NP is in relationship to the towns of Topsham and Exeter.  I've been putting off some family research in Topsham.  BUT, if it's as close to Dartmoor as I think is is, I'M THERE next vacation.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has a map or link to a decent map, I'd be great.<br/>

Mapquest.com has maps from all over the world, not just the U.S. On the <br/>
main page of their site, just select the UK as the country, then enter <br/>
Topsham or Exeter. That enormous green area on the left side of the map <br/>
(zoom out if you need to) is Dartmoor National Park.<br/>
<br/>
Also, using the driving directions feature on the site, I found out that <br/>
it's 33.21 miles from Topsham to Princetown, which is roughly in the middle <br/>
of the park.<br/>

can drive the length of it in a day! And Dartmoor is awesome!<br/>
