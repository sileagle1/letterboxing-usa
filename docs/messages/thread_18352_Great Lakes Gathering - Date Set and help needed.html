<br/>
The polling is complete, and we now have a date set for our<br/>
gathering! The 2004 Great Lakes Gathering will be on June 12, 2004.<br/>
<br/>
You can go to the "official" website at:<br/>
<br/>
http://home.wi.rr.com/dragonlber/GLG.htm<br/>
<br/>
Remember - if you want to make an event box, whether you'll be in<br/>
attendence or not, it can be based on any theme you wish. We would<br/>
like to have a number of boxes based on the theme "Cooler by the<br/>
Lake", however.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxers from outside the Great Lakes region are invited to come <br/>
as well!  If you cannot make it, we would love to have event boxes <br/>
and travellers from other areas of the US.  Contact me if you are <br/>
interested in sending event boxes/travellers.<br/>
<br/>
Please email me to let me know whether you plan to attend and<br/>
whether you will help in any area noted on the website.<br/>
<br/>
I should have a location picked early in Easter week.  Somewhere <br/>
around Chicago...<br/>
