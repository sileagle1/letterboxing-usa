<br/>
My husband and I are new to letterboxing, and had chosen to find the ones <br/>
at Huntley Meadows last weekend as well.  We, too, only found the second <br/>
one, but being so new, we figured we may have just missed the first one <br/>
(the Frog Box).  The second one, the Dragonfly, refers to a "bat tree/J + B <br/>
heart" - never did find this tree, but did see a stump that we apparently <br/>
guessed correctly could have been the correct tree, because, according to <br/>
the directions ("look for a big tree bearing 300 degrees about 35 steps <br/>
forward") from this stump was the letterbox!  And boy we were thrilled to <br/>
see it!  :)<br/>
<br/>
What a beautiful place Huntley Meadows is - we had no idea it was there, <br/>
right in the "middle" of civilization - a true treasure.<br/>
<br/>
Take care!<br/>
