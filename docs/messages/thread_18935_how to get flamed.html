                    <div class="plaintext-content">To answer the question of what you have to do to get flamed, it <br/>
appears to be:<br/>
A) You could ask a question about letterboxing.<br/>
or<br/>
B) You could set up a webpage for the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
and yeah, I could leave the list because I don't like the tone at <br/>
times, but I don't believe in rewarding others for acting like <br/>
losers.  if people need to relive junior high, it's fine by me.<br/>
<br/>
by the way, mr. rayvenhaus, i have repatedly tried to sign up for <br/>
the new forum, but it keeps telling me it can't accept new members.  <br/>
what's up with that?<br/>
