Saint Veronicas Letterbox<br/>
Lourdes of Litchfield Shrine<br/>
Litchfield, CT  (Litchfield County, Connecticut)<br/>
Rating: Very Easy<br/>
Placed by Magic Mike and his wife on October 5, 2002 (Our 17th Wedding <br/>
Anniversary)<br/>
<br/>
Lourdes of Litchfield Shrine is located in the beautiful town of Litchfield, <br/>
CT on Route 183.  It is very easy to find and is a peaceful quiet spot for <br/>
meditation or picnicking.<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is placed to honor the courage and selflessness of one <br/>
persons act of compassion.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most enduring and inspiring stories of a saint is that of <br/>
Veronica.  Little is known about her life, but she lived at the same time as <br/>
Jesus and was present during his trials on Good Friday.<br/>
<br/>
While Jesus carried the cross, he was shouted at and spit upon by a furious, <br/>
almost uncontrollable crowd; his face was covered in sweat, blood and mud, <br/>
and he was having difficulty remaining on his feet.<br/>
<br/>
Watching Jesus fall was so painful for Veronica that she stepped out of the <br/>
angry thong, despite the risk to her own life.  With true compassion, she <br/>
knelt in front of Jesus and used her veil to gently wipe his face clean.  <br/>
This simple act of kindness still resonates all over the world.  The event <br/>
is commemorated on the sixth station of the cross.<br/>
<br/>
As soldiers pushed her away, Veronica went home and discovered that Christs <br/>
face was imprinted on her veil.  It is believed that Veronica later traveled <br/>
to Rome, leaving the veil in the care of Pope Clement I and his successors.  <br/>
Her name and legend is said to come from the words vera icon (true image), <br/>
which is what the veil is called.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout history, Veronica herself as well as her veil have been part of <br/>
various legends.  According to a popular Italian legend, the veil was used <br/>
to cure the Roman emperor Tiberius of an illness.  French legend holds that <br/>
Veronica came to the region of Bordeaux shortly after the Ascension of <br/>
Christ, and preached there for many years.  In all its many forms, <br/>
Veronicas story is a lesson about selfless compassion, and inspires us to <br/>
show love for each other.<br/>
<br/>
This box is placed in honor of Veronicas selflessness with the hope that <br/>
her courage and compassion will spread throughout the world.<br/>
<br/>
To find the letterbox, you must walk the Stations of the Cross.  It is a <br/>
nice and peaceful walk along a paved pathway.  While St. Veronicas act is <br/>
located on the Sixth Station, you will find the box located at the Fifth <br/>
Station.<br/>
<br/>
Right next to the Fifth Station, there is a large uprooted tree.  Go behind <br/>
the tree, the box is placed behind it.  There is a bench at each station, so <br/>
there is a place to sit down and stamp in.  Feel free to leave a note or <br/>
thought or contemplation.  Just remember to hide the box in the same <br/>
location, hidden from view.  Thanks.<br/>
