Easy, great for families.  But watch for cars.  <br/>

	This would be the most ordinary of dingy strip malls, were it <br/>
not for its owner, an art patron named David Bermant.  Instead, <br/>
thanks to Bermant's passion for public art, the mall has<br/>
more than twenty pieces of sculpture towering over the parking lots <br/>
and lining the sidewalk in front of the stores.   Many of them move<br/>
some almost imperceptibly, some with the push of a<br/>
button, others with every breeze.  For a complete list of the art, <br/>
and the controversies that have sometimes surrounded it, see <br/>
http://www.enteract.com/~jdeubel/plaza/<br/>
	Undoubtedly, the best-known piece of art in the Cermak Plaza, <br/>
thanks both to its size and its cameo role in the movie "Wayne's <br/>
World," is an 80 foot tall spike that appears to have been<br/>
pushed through a stack ofeight cars in various stages of <br/>
disintegration. The sculpture is officially named "Spindle" but at <br/>
our house we've always just called it "Cars-on-a-stick."  This<br/>
letterbox is placed in honor of this quirky piece of public art and <br/>
in the hopes that you'll stop awhile and appreciate this too-often-<br/>
neglected collection.  <br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
    The Cermak Plaza is located at the southeast corner of the <br/>
intersection of Harlem Avenue and Cermak Road in Berwyn, Illinois.  <br/>
For those familiar with the Chicago grid, that would make it<br/>
2200 South and 7200 West, or about eight miles from downtown <br/>
Chicago.  Both the Eisenhower expressway (I-290) and the Stevenson <br/>
Expressway (I-55) have Harlem Avenue exits (the mall is<br/>
about two miles south of the Eisenhower and about four miles north of <br/>
the Stevenson).  If you want to avoid the expressway,  it's also fun <br/>
to take Cermak Road all the way out, through the<br/>
heart of Chicago's large Mexican community.    <br/>
	Once you've located the mall, start your search at the base <br/>
of the Cars-on-a-stick.  Note and remember the artist's nameyou'll <br/>
need it later.  Now look toward the horizon, facing the<br/>
same direction as the spindled car with the license plate KPA 807. As <br/>
you scan the horizon to your left you'll see a water tower, and then <br/>
just below and to the left of the water tower, you'll see a moving <br/>
sculpture that just sticks above a small square building.  That <br/>
sculpture is called "Bee Tree" by artist George Rhoads.<br/>
          You're going to go over by Bee Tree, but you'd be<br/>
crazy to just cut across the parking lot. Instead walk over to the <br/>
strip mall and walk along the sidewalk in front of the stores, <br/>
admiring the other sculptures on your way.  As you come to the small <br/>
square building you'll notice a tiny area with a picnic table and <br/>
some benches.  That might be a good place to come back to with the<br/>
letterbox after you find it.   Now go to the Bee Tree.  Starting from <br/>
in front of Bee Tree, go around the square building until you find <br/>
another sculpture by the same artist who did the cars-<br/>
on-a-stick.  As you read the sign, notice that you are in an <br/>
extremely public spot.  So read the sign very intently as you <br/>
carefully and quietly reach behind the rear wheel well to pull out the<br/>
letterbox.  Then move away as discreetly as you can to stamp up.  <br/>
Please remember to be equally careful as you return the box.   <br/>
