                    <div class="plaintext-content">I noticed that somebody asked about this.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't planted any boxes, but I've found a lot, and found a lot to be<br/>
missing.  So I may not have room to talk, but I have room to bitch :)<br/>
<br/>
The missing ones were in STUPID places.  (we could also blame whoever<br/>
found it last, that perhaps they left it in the open, I've heard of this<br/>
happening).<br/>
<br/>
One box was supposed to be under a pile of rocks under a bridge, up<br/>
against a wall that was supporting the bridge.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, this wouldn't be so bad if it was just a little itty bitty foot<br/>
bridge.  But this was a covered bridge, with TONS of partying room<br/>
underneath.  It looked like it got some graffiti action and someone had<br/>
used some rocks to build a fire.  The place we guessed where it was was<br/>
just against a nice handy dandy wall for leaning up against/sleeping<br/>
next to.  It was relatively clean, nothing in the way.  It looked rather<br/>
cozy actually.  Having a pile of rocks right against the wall with no<br/>
other rocks along that whole wall? Good gourds, man!  Its our guess that<br/>
whoever built that fire found the box.<br/>
<br/>
Now, a more LOGICAL place to hide the box under that bridge was actually<br/>
a little further river side.  There was another wall supporting the<br/>
bridge, with a TON of big, heavy river rocks piled all around one side<br/>
of it and the other side was teaming with blackberry bushes and there<br/>
was a small pile of rocks there and a couple others scattered about. <br/>
There was a few -very- good places to hide a small box where it wouldn't<br/>
have been found by accident.<br/>
<br/>
Now to be fair, maybe that's where it -might- have been hidden<br/>
(sometimes clues suck horribly!) and the last placer didn't hide it<br/>
well.  I can't get too upset at the Planter because I wasn't there.<br/>
<br/>
Just be logical about where you hide your boxes! Don't put them<br/>
somewhere that a cleanup/maintenance person can get them by accident. <br/>
Don't make anything look out of place.  If you go box hunting and you<br/>
have found several boxes to be missing, ask yourself WHY are they<br/>
missing? Just because its in a high foot-traffic area doesn't mean its<br/>
poorly hidden.<br/>
<br/>
And after you've been boxing for a bit, you should be able to get a feel<br/>
for where a box is.  It -can- mean that it was poorly hidden, but it can<br/>
also mean that you're At One with the Box and you're used to the feel of<br/>
hidey holes... if that makes sense :)<br/>
<br/>
That's all I can think of off hand.  I tend to be too wordy sometimes<br/>
and don't actually get around to saying everything I want to because<br/>
then it ends up really long like this :-p<br/>
<br/>
If you want to hear about the other boxes we've found to be missing,<br/>
just let me know.  I'll explain the details behind them as much as I<br/>
can, just so you can get an idea.  I could also go into details of some<br/>
well planted boxes :)<br/>

They were too public, the area too well manacured and attended, and too much risk of someone cleaning up the hiding spot and finding the box.<br/>
<br/>
  Finding a really good location to plant the box is a lot of fun, and also challenging!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">as far as what makes a poor quality box, that is going to vary from <br/>
person to person and it comes down to personal preference.<br/>
<br/>
store-bought stamps are somewhat disappointing, but i will look for a <br/>
box regardless of what kind of stamp it has, if i'm in the area.  i <br/>
like the challenge of the hunt.<br/>
<br/>
a poorly planted box is basically one that is poorly hid and in a high-<br/>
traffic area.  you can plant boxes in high tourist areas but hide them <br/>
a little away from the beaten path.  i have found some that were very <br/>
poorly hidden, and one has recently gone missing.  i expect another <br/>
one, planted within the last couple of weeks, to go missing soon too <br/>
because it is an extremely poor location -- will be seen easily by <br/>
muggles.<br/>
<br/>
when we hide boxes, we try to chose places that are a bit out of the <br/>
way, but not difficult to get to.  we also try to plant them out of <br/>
sight of roads, houses, gift shops, parking lots, etc. so there is <br/>
less chance of someone finding them being seen.<br/>

Hey, Xeen,,, Gary here,,,<br/>
<br/>
I'm not "attacking", just trying to be helpful.  You stated "attack" <br/>
wasn't the right word,,,  The word I've usually heard on forums, when <br/>
someone feels that others are "attacking" them is "flames".  (OR, <br/>
even if they ARE "attacking" them  :-)   )  You can get flames at <br/>
times, and you can get flowers.  Not every time someone has a <br/>
different opinion and maybe expresses it bluntly (or maybe not so <br/>
bluntly) is considered "flames".  Anyway, you said you couldn't think <br/>
of the right word, and I thought I'd pass along the one I have always heard.<br/>
<br/>

The thing is..........as you said........it's a fact of life that boxes are<br/>
going to go missing and that boxes, particularly by newer folks (since<br/>
there's a learning curve)are going to be poorly planted at times.  If<br/>
everyone came on here and complained about it.....yuck!<br/>

Someone else mentioned the newboxers list -- that list is generally a lot<br/>
more tolerant I think.  And you also might want to check yahoogroups and see<br/>
if there's a regional group encompassing your area -- those are generally a<br/>
bit more tolerant.<br/>

<br/>
For a letterboxing database that is concerned about abandoned boxes see Atlas Quest http://www.atlasquest.com <br/>
In April 2006, Atlas Quest came up with an 'abandoned box' policy....<br/>
"For all boxes that don't have an owner who has logged into AQ for one full year, [the webmaster is] going to set those boxes up as being available for adoption. Less than 1% of  the boxes on AQ fit this description, and as long as you log in once a year,  you're boxes won't go up for adoption. This is about people who've stopped  letterboxing altogether--or at least left clues on AQ that they no longer  maintain." You can see more of the message at:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/boards/message.html?gMsgId=20557<br/>
<br/>
For more genteel discussion boards I recommend the Atlas Quest boards: http://www.atlasquest.com/boards/categories.html and the Newboxers yahoo group: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>

might want to try both sides of the coin- the planting in addition <br/>
to the finding- before coming to any conclusions about planting 9see <br/>
title of post).  While both are intregral, they often require <br/>
somewhat different skill sets and there's no reason, this early in <br/>
your game, to ostracize yourself and those planters of the boxes <br/>
you've already found, or not, by complaining about them publically.  <br/>
<br/>
Complaining does make you come across as an ungrateful newbie even <br/>
though you intend the message to be otherwise. You feel you are <br/>
under attack, how must the planters of those boxes must feel when <br/>
someone so new is so ready to take them to the cleaners?  There is <br/>
room for everybody- even those you might think are crappy placers <br/>
and those someone else might think are crappy carvers.<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend the newboxers list, not because there is less <br/>
flaming there, but it's a great place to learn why some things are <br/>
done the way they are and ideas on how to improve your own boxing <br/>
and to share ideas to help others see things perhaps differently.<br/>
