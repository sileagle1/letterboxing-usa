                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well I wrote to Jars of Clay telling them that the box #1 at Henry <br/>
Cowdry Nature center in Lunenburg was missing.  I went in the woods the <br/>
next day letterboxing with a friend and out comes this guy with two <br/>
boxer dogs . He said the dogs brought the box home and since I knew <br/>
about letterboxing could I tell him where the box belonged. I had the <br/>
directions in a notebook and told him. so now all is well. What a hoot. <br/>
Donna P  PS Please Jars of Clay replace Diana's angel in the Rollstone <br/>
cemetery near the metal grate, under the tree.<br/>
