did manage, in the past couple weeks, to find the wehr nature center box<br/>
<good condition="">, the boyhood adventure series (good shape, though the<br/>
doctor's park one had obviously been water damaged prior - it was dry and<br/>
sealed tight when we found it, though), the and on easter sunday we traveled<br/>
to geneva, illinois and found the island park box, also in fine condition.<br/>
we were there for a cougar's ballgame and used the time before the game to<br/>
go letterboxing...a great way to spend a sunday!<br/>
