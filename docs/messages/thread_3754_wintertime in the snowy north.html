There is a product called PZ Kut that is great to<br/>
carve and reasonably priced. You can find it at: <br/>
http://www.investorsnet.com/stampeaz/<br/>
<br/>
They also have the Speedball lino cutting tools. They<br/>
are v shaped cutters and range from #1 for fine cuts<br/>
to #5 for gouging out large areas. You can buy them<br/>
individually or in a set. You can also pick these up<br/>
at most art supply stores.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a set of boxes to put out and am wondering<br/>
if I should wait until Spring.  I can't wait to hear<br/>
(see) the responses you get.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Carving,<br/>

On one hand, I'm itching to get some out there so we can begin to give<br/>
back to all of you who have provided us such great entertainment this<br/>
year.  On the other hand, I'm thinking it could be fun to stockpile a few<br/>
through the winter and offer them all at once, especially since one will<br/>
be located near a seasonal attraction that is now closed for the winter.<br/>

&gt;We're on the verge of planting a few boxes in CT, but were wondering if<br/>
&gt;it would be best to hold off until spring.  Do many of you bring your<br/>
&gt;boxes home for the winter and place them back out when the trails clear,<br/>
&gt;or are most boxes out year-round?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Definitely put them out now!!!  Dan and I usually find more boxes in the<br/>
winter, than in the summer.  The weather is nice and cool for hiking, and we<br/>
seem to have more free time.<br/>

regardless of weather...the only exception is when we have Erin AND <br/>
the snow is deep--she's not quite that much of a trooper. But snow <br/>
doesn't keep us grown-ups inside.<br/>
<br/>
As far as box conditions go, we haven't found any problems in winter <br/>
that aren't also present in summer. Ink pads don't seem to freeze.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">    In my opinion, you should go ahead and plant the boxes, but just take<br/>
into account how the clues might work out if there is a foot of snow there.<br/>
I loved a hike we did in Durham last fall where one of the clues was "a<br/>
flat-rock cairn".  Great clue for most of the year (the cairn would be<br/>
missed if you weren't looking for it) but it would have been undetectable<br/>
under snow as it only stood a few inches tall.  And a vague clue like one in<br/>
Hartman Park that is actually for pre-school children and older siblings<br/>
told you to go up on a hill  where settlers'children fished from all three<br/>
sides and find Letterbox #3. Well, okay, but when the hill is totally<br/>
covered with snow it becomes quite the challenge!  The hiding places become<br/>
much harder to notice.   Just my opinion.  Ann T. in Connecticut<br/>
