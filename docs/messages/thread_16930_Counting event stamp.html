                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've been to 1 event. We counted the event stamp as just that, an <br/>
event stamp. Everyone wanted to sign our HH before we set it loose. <br/>
Being new, we allowed that. In the future I think we will keep HHs a <br/>
secret. I believe the event stamp should be counted, as it brings us <br/>
together to share this wonderful hobby. I don't believe, however, <br/>
that it should counted as a find. There should be a consensus at <br/>
events as to what the "official" event stamp is. Other stamps made <br/>
for that gathering should be planted so people can enjoy "The hunt". <br/>
Perhaps this issue should be the next poll that is taken.<br/>
