10 boxes. Four of them shall remain nameless as they were mysteries,  - <br/>
we love them -  Peggy Dow , pretty place ,pretty stamp, pretty windy !! <br/>
Indian in a Cupboard,!! Well, bring your River Raft !! Actually it was <br/>
only a stream, but fast moving and coming from a magical place that even <br/>
with her Headlamp, Bluebird could not see the back of the cave. No <br/>
problem but  lots of giggles.  Read the Log Book.!!  The Bike trail, <br/>
which we walked to  off Silver Lane. Nice wind there too and there was a <br/>
Walk A Thonn going on . We were the only ones going in that direction, <br/>
so it looked as if we were all finished and on the way back. !! Got the <br/>
box and it is hidden so great. No one except a boxer would pick up <br/>
trash.  Music Woman's house box she so kindly left out for us as she was <br/>
in church praying for us. Her cat Sammy would not come to the window, <br/>
but we tried, so did stamp into his box too.  A little cheating there <br/>
 Got to finish up two bonus clues that we had before Christmas and the <br/>
snow kept us away.  All in all A great day and thank you Bluebird for <br/>
driving  into places that I dare not drive !! She is a Cowboy !!<br/>
Smile,   Butterfly<br/>
