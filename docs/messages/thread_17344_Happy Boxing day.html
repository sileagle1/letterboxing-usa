work so hard to make this hobby happen.  From the webmasters who <br/>
provide such a vital service that it could not exist without them.  <br/>
To the planters who find wonderful parks to visit.  To the stamp <br/>
carvers who make beautiful works of art.  To the finders who leave <br/>
inspiring messages in the log books for us to read and enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
This hobby has been a great pastime for me.  It gets me out to visit <br/>
lots of places I would never have known about.<br/>
<br/>
New year's resolutions are easy for me ... plant (or adopt) more <br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Now get out there and find those boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing day to all.<br/>
