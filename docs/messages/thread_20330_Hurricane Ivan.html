Thanks Devonpeter,<br/>
Your prayers are so welcome. Zed and I and others were<br/>
talking this morning about how and what we should pray<br/>
for.... My personal prayer would be that Ivan takes no<br/>
more lives. I have lots of folks in FL. so I know that<br/>
you are all a bit relived. With boxdn and photobug to<br/>
entertain us I'm sure we will all be just fine. Guess<br/>
we will have to conjure up a drink and name it after<br/>
our favorite hobby!! Then we can manufacture it and it<br/>
can be a letter (box drink) :)<br/>
<br/>
   Hope all of you New Orleans will be safe! <br/>
Grits<br/>

sound.  My husband, who is in the Navy reserves, left for Gulfport, <br/>
Mississippi on Sunday, just in time for this storm.  He was moved <br/>
into a storm shelter on base from his off-base seaside hotel this <br/>
morning and will be doing disaster relief work if necessary when Ivan <br/>
has passed.  God bless and keep you all.<br/>
