<br/>
Just wanted to put out there that I found a half empty box in the<br/>
Charles Ward Reservation, at the base of Hollt Hill.  It was very<br/>
close to the final location of the "Due North" box we were looking for<br/>
and found.  After contacting "Due North's" placer I've found that they<br/>
know nothing about it.  There are no other listed or non-mystery boxes<br/>
in the immediate area other than "Great Blue Heron" in the same<br/>
reservation, but several miles away.  <br/>
<br/>
It was found in the open and opened at the base of a fallen stone<br/>
chimney. The existing contents were a black pen, and a "Dino Thunder -<br/>
Power Rangers" ink pad. There were no other distinguishing marks on<br/>
the box itself.  <br/>
<br/>
I've re-hidden it close by.  If it is yours email me.<br/>

We stumbled across this box while hiking towards "Due North" on<br/>
August 12. It was left out in the open at that time and the blue <br/>
color stuck out like a sore thumb against the predominantly green <br/>
background. <br/>
<br/>
The original information inside the box stated that it was the<br/>
"Junior Girl Scout Troup 3703" letterbox. Apparently the troup (from <br/>
Reading, MA if memory serves me correctly) placed it there to earn <br/>
some sort of badge. The notebook is the waterproof kind so any stamps <br/>
are probably smudged. It was never listed on either LB site.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, this was what I was referring to with my answer to the "most <br/>
bizarre" question on the Atlasquest interview.<br/>
