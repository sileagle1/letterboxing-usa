<br/>
  Currently, the website lists the "Hal and the Magic Mushroom" box as being <br/>
reported lost. It is not lost, but was misplaced and damaged. Water entered <br/>
the box, and the log book is a puddle of mush, but the stamp has survived. I <br/>
did not have a new logbook for the box, so someone may want to bring an extra <br/>
one along - I might not be able to get back the box for some time due to <br/>
heavy work schedule. I've put the box back where I believe it was supposed to <br/>
be, and was able to isolate the stamp in a new plastic bag. Happy hunting!<br/>
