Sorry to hear that you couldn't find Fort Trumbull: alot of these <br/>
close-to-the-water's-edge boxes are floating off and we've resolved <br/>
not to plant any more. We'll try to stop by later in the week and <br/>
check on that one.<br/>

&gt; Hi, Elizabeth! I just checked on Aix sponsa while doing "Bridges of<br/>
&gt; Pequot Woods" (whose clues are not online but available at EMS) maybe<br/>
&gt; 3 weeks ago and both boxes were safely in their nests. I did see the<br/>
&gt; message in the second box about the first being missing. Maybe we<br/>
&gt; need to re-read the clues since both are meant to be easy boxes.<br/>

Hi Jay!<br/>
<br/>
"Frogger" and I were at Aix sponsa on April 22 and the first box was<br/>
intact at that point; if fact, it was left with some company (I think a<br/>
cat was prowling around the nest - hint, hint).  I am ashamed to say<br/>
that we did not find the second box even though the clues were pretty<br/>
straight forward.<br/>
<br/>
Today was a day of drive-by boxes for us.  We stamped in on the last<br/>
page of the Big Sugar Maple Letterbox log book.  I would have replace<br/>
the log but we brought only the bare minimum supplies as we knew we<br/>
would be driving through the area.  It is a popular "first letterbox"<br/>
for many.  We also "Zoomed" to Essex for another quick stop.<br/>
<br/>
We hope this weather keeps up far into the fall!<br/>

Zero" series (clues only at EMS) have gone missing. We'll try to re-<br/>
carve and re-hide in the next couple of weeks. We've got a stamp <br/>
redone for the missing first letterbox at Devil's Hopyard in East <br/>
Haddam and hope to get that one stashed soon as well.<br/>
