                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've completed most of my adventures down Highway 101, looking for <br/>
and hiding a blizard of boxes.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Before leaving Portland, I tried to nab Funhog's Hidden Dragon box, <br/>
but to no avail.  Where I thought the box was located was <br/>
approximately five feet from where some maintenance workers were <br/>
working, so being indiscreat was hard.  I suspect they were looking <br/>
at me with highly suspicious looks.  And when I did finally try to <br/>
check out the area, I didn't find the box.  Is it missing?  Was I <br/>
looking in the wrong spot?  Or was it so far in that crevess I <br/>
couldn't reach it?  We may never know....<br/>
<br/>
However, I did find Funhog's Bluebird Trail letterbox.  Watched a <br/>
beautiful sunset from there.  I stopped by on April 1st, and it had <br/>
one of those ticket dispenses.  Put three bucks in and out pops your <br/>
day pass.  I noticed the date stamp was March 32nd.  I'm not sure if <br/>
that was meant as an April Fool joke or if there was a glitch in <br/>
their system, but I've saved the ticket as proof.  =)<br/>
<br/>
I also tried checking up on my Wappato Island Mystery box, mostly <br/>
because so many people seem to have visited it!  (At least six that I <br/>
know of!)  Unfortunately, it seems to be MISSING!  *sobbing*  Yes, I <br/>
hunted all around for it and the box is gone.  It didn't last long, <br/>
but I'm glad so many people got to visit it in its short lifespan!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Alas, I had to leave without finding the series the Traveling Circus <br/>
was in the process of hiding.  *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
Then I headed out to Lincoln City, nabbing the Devil's Lake State <br/>
Park letterbox.  Beautiful stamp!  It sadly hasn't been visited <br/>
often.  Just two yahoos from Colorado until I showed up.  =)  But the <br/>
box is alive and well, and the stamp is definitely worth nabbing!  <br/>
Adorable!  =)<br/>
<br/>
The next couple hundred miles I spend hiding four letterboxes.  I've <br/>
posted clues for one of them already, but more will be forthcoming.<br/>
<br/>
Then I decided to nab the ultra-elusive boxes at Paradise Lodge, <br/>
placed by Don and Gwen.  My first Don and Gwen boxes--I HAD to nab <br/>
those!  =)  They mentioned rafting in to the place, and an airstrip <br/>
nearby you could fly into.  Being a spur-of-the-moment decision, I <br/>
settled for hiking in.  I'm now suffering from a few blisters since <br/>
25 miles of hiking is a bit excessive, even for me, but I happily <br/>
nabbed both boxes.  Very cute stamps, too.  =)  The river looks like <br/>
it would have make a fabulous rafting trip!  I'll have to try it <br/>
again someday, using the raft instead of my feet.  =)  Not <br/>
surprisingly, not many people have visited these very off-the-beaten-<br/>
track letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Northern California seems devoid of letterboxes along Highway 101, <br/>
but that's okay, because after that 25 mile hike, I was ready for <br/>
some serious driving time.  =)  As an aside, if you find an Oregon <br/>
license plate XFL 310 on Highway 101 in southern Oregon or northern <br/>
California, it's MINE!  <br/>
<br/>
That got me to Santa Rosa late in the afternoon the next day.  Nabbed <br/>
the Sugarloaf letterbox, alive and well.  The Annadel State Park box <br/>
appears to be missing, though.  In fact, the area where it was <br/>
supposed to be was torn up pretty badly from someone obviously <br/>
looking for the box.  Very sad.  It's people like this that make park <br/>
administrators not want letterboxing in their area.  Whoever did that <br/>
damage is on my Dumb Bastard of the Week list.  Sometimes, I think a <br/>
missing letterbox causes more damage than ones that are there!<br/>
<br/>
Then I headed off to Bay Wildlife Refuge series.  Speaking of which, <br/>
if you're looking for a place to sleep in that area, the cops <br/>
informed that there's an ordinance in Newark making it against the <br/>
law to sleep in your car anywhere in the city.  And they WILL wake <br/>
you up at 2:30 in the morning by shining large spotlights into your <br/>
eyes and inform you of this.  =)<br/>
<br/>
The first box of the series was reported missing, and I agree since I <br/>
couldn't find it.  Got the second one okay.  The third one, which was <br/>
there as far as I knew, I wasn't able to find.  I'm not entirely sure <br/>
if my search just wasn't thorough enough or if it's really missing.  <br/>
In any case, I did get letterbox #2 of the series.<br/>
<br/>
And then I headed over the bay to nab the two boxes at Palo Atlo that <br/>
were reported as still being there.  Happy to say, I nabbed them <br/>
both.  Biggest honking stamps I ever did see, too.  =)<br/>
<br/>
And last, I headed out towards Santa Cruz to nab the Loma Prieta <br/>
Earthquake letterbox.  My eyes nearly popped out when I saw the size <br/>
of this letterbox.  I thought it was a geocache the thing is so <br/>
honking big!  (You KNOW it's big if I call it "honking" big.)  If you <br/>
have a stereo system you want to store, it might fit in this box.  <br/>
=)  In any case, it's a wonderfully put together box including <br/>
information about the earthquake, 911 transcripts, pictures of some <br/>
of the damage, etc.  It's been a very well visited box, however it <br/>
seems only Pam and Todd are the only ones were were actually looking <br/>
for it.  The box does explain what letterboxing is and to "stamp in <br/>
and sign your name", which is exactly what all the visitors did.  <br/>
They stamped the log with the stamp inside the letterbox (ink pad <br/>
provided), and many pages are now covered with that one stamp image <br/>
over and over again.  Very amusing.  =)<br/>
<br/>
I was going to nab the letterbox at Morgan Hill, but it was starting <br/>
to get late and I wanted to reach San Luis that evening.  However, I <br/>
do go through Morgan Hill several times a year, and I figured that <br/>
one could wait until another day.<br/>
<br/>
Still have about 200 miles left of traveling before I reach Los <br/>
Angeles (my final destination), but it's been a wonderful adventure <br/>
so far!  =)  Thanks to everyone who helped provide information on the <br/>
boxes that were there (or not!).<br/>
<br/>
Farewell!<br/>
