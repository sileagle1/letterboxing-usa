                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yup, Culex and I are trying to lure some letterboxers our way. We just <br/>
planted "Vaughan Woods" in South Berwick, ME on 8/31. As a <br/>
reminder, since mid-August we have also planted:<br/>
"Two-Faced Fox" in Springvale<br/>
"Mystery (you'll find out the name when you get there)" with clues <br/>
inside it leading to "The Green Fox"<br/>
"Goldeneye" in Ogunquit<br/>
"Fort Foster" in Kittery<br/>
There are also some new hitchikers you might see thumbing their way <br/>
around in these parts including:<br/>
"Predator and Prey", "The Love-ly Hitchhiker", and "The Maine Event" <br/>
an event stamp turned hitchhiker.<br/>
Please, please, please, please, come check these boxes out.......<br/>
