Just a note to let everyone know that 3 out of 4 apples are alive and <br/>
well in New York. It took hours of computer research, long distance <br/>
phone calls and brainstorming sessions  into the wee hours of the <br/>
morning, but Princess Lea and Amanda from Seattle were able to figure <br/>
out the letterbox clues for this series (with help from Funhog and <br/>
Legerdemaine himself)!!<br/>
<br/>
We went a hunting for the boxes and sadly, Liberty Apple was the one <br/>
missing. We were also victorious in translating the ghoti letterbox <br/>
clue (Funhog take a bow). It is alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
Gorgeous Stamps from Legerdemaine, as usual. Well worth the workout <br/>
our grey cells endured!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for the challenge.<br/>
