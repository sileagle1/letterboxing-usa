for him that Butterfly and Bluebird were flying by and grabbed it for <br/>

gets this stamp in their book in one happy boxer. It is beautiful and <br/>
the carving is top of the heap. Aili and Bruce , you did a great job and <br/>
we three feel honored to have the image in our books. The way it gets <br/>
'planted'  is great fun and gives us pause to look around looking for <br/>
another spot to plant.  How in the world do we count this guy ??<br/>

Lobsta is the one that found the Peter McGuire Traveller. She read and<br/>
enjoyed the whole story. Even commented to me how interesting it was.<br/>
You did some big research on that one and we do thank you for that.<br/>
However to be honest,  I glanced at it , a real quick read,  [not a<br/>
history buff ] and Bluebird flew over it !! We really were excited about<br/>
the whole thing and yes, Aili, the stamp is still to die for.!<br/>
