WAAAAAAAAAAAA!<br/>
<br/>
I will consider replacing it in the future.<br/>

Did anyone ever find this box?<br/>

I found it on August 25th, and--if I recall correctly--I was the <br/>
first person to find it.  I could be wrong, though, since it was a <br/>
while ago.<br/>
<br/>
I'd suggest that if you replace it, to find a different location for <br/>
it.  From the litter and alcoholic bottles laying around in the area <br/>
along with the relatively remoteness of the area despite being in the <br/>
middle of the city, it seems like quite the party place and it was <br/>
just a matter of time before one of those partiers found it <br/>
accidentally.  And I suspect those kind of people probably have <br/>
little respect for things like letterboxes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Amanda and Ryan, thanks. When I first placed the box it was clean and gated.<br/>
My concern then was from the people fishing on river. If I had found the box<br/>
intact I would have pulled it after seeing the place this past weekend.<br/>
Things have only gotten worse there. My error was going on the far side<br/>
there. Oh well. :-(<br/>
