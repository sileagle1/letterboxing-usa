<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Follow the directions to the Scott's Cove box.  When you have finished with <br/>
that box face the water and look to your left where you see the next point of <br/>
land.  Make you way back to the trail and head for that point.  When you arrive <br/>
at the end of the trail facing the open water turn around 180 degrees and find <br/>
a leaning oak tree between two pines.  At the base of the tree you find what <br/>
you seek under a rock.<br/>
<br/>
After you have enjoyed the scenery and maybe caught sight of a Heron or an <br/>
American Bittern, head back down the trail to find box #3.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Box #3. The Stump<br/>
<br/>
Make your way back on the same trail, cross the creek and follow the trail to <br/>
the left until you see a skinny tree with a white blaze on the right.  Take the <br/>
way less travelled up the hill and at the wide trail at the top,turn right.  <br/>
Continue on past the crooked tree with the grey rings until you come to a metal <br/>
gate.  At the gate turn left onto the small trail and go 10 paces.  On the left <br/>
<br/>
of the trail you will see a tall tree stump with lichen on its bark.  At the <br/>
foot of the tree is a fallen tree (probably the top half of the stump), Where <br/>
the fallen tree breaks you discover the box.<br/>
<br/>
 Back on the trail, follow it down the hill where it will intersect with the <br/>
trail that leads back to the parking lot.<br/>
