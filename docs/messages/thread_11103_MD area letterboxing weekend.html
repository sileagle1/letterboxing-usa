frazzled mom snarling at her two bickering children! I hereby <br/>
announce a belated new year's resolution: I will not be shy on the <br/>
trail. I will greet you cordially and ask if you are letterboxing. We <br/>
shouldn't pass up the opportunity for an exchange. And meeting Dead <br/>
Duck Chuck on the trail is probably the only way to acquire his <br/>
stamp...if you can catch him!<br/>
<br/>
Hope we cross paths again!<br/>
<br/>
Donna and family<br/>

&gt; 2.  went out to rocky gorge and got dogpaddle beach<br/>
&gt; and the fishing one by the beaver dam.  Realized after<br/>
&gt; we saw them that we probably missed the opportunity<br/>
&gt; for an exchange with the 4 people walking up the hill<br/>
&gt; as we were walking down.  Which is unfortunate because<br/>
&gt; dead duck chuck has the best stamp we've ever seen.<br/>
