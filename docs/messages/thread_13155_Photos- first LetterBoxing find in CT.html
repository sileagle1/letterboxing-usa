 PAM! yes, I am the fabric-stamping scarf woman . . . . but Ahhhhh, <br/>
I believe you came to one of my classes, bringing along your stuffed <br/>
Log Book as you had just found 2 or 3 more that morning! You really <br/>
did peak my interest. Prior to that day, I had read some about LB, <br/>
but it was not until you shared all of the boxes that you had found <br/>
via your log book and all of the cool, mainly hand-carved stamps <br/>
that I actually went to letterboxing.org &amp; looked up some clues! <br/>
Frankly, I was amazed by how many there are near us her in CT. <br/>
<br/>
 So, a heartfelt thanks to you, and hello to Sue S. out there -- <br/>
thanks so much for your note too!<br/>
