Besides Letterboxing one of my favorite past times is Racing, I love<br/>
watching those men and women push it to the edge.Sometimes they go too<br/>
far and fate steps in.In 2001 the Winston cup devision lost one of its<br/>
biggest icons in motor sports,and he was also my favorite driver.This<br/>
Letterbox is dedicated to the man in black Dale Earnhardt.April 29<br/>
1951-Febuary 18 2001.                              Directions: From<br/>
Interstate 395 North or South take exit 99. Coming from the north bound<br/>
lane at the end of the exit take a right.South bound lane take the exit<br/>
and then take a left.Now you are traveling east on RT.200,keep going<br/>
until you come to a stop sign.you will turn left here onto RT.193,go 1.5<br/>
miles and you will see a billboard for Thompson Speedway take that right<br/>
onto East Thompson road.Travel down a ways and you will pass Thompson<br/>
Speedway on your right,then you will go pass the speedway golf cource<br/>
also on you right.Then you will go up a small hill,you will see a<br/>
cemetery on the right just before you get to the top of the hill pull<br/>
into the first driveway of the cemetery and drive straight back to the<br/>
end.There will be a huge pine tree to the right,go behind that tree and<br/>
walk over to the medium size tree with the smaller trees growing around<br/>
it.You need to go down behind this tree,the Letterbox is under some<br/>
sticks and pine needles.Off in the distance you can see the speedway and<br/>
if you come at the right time you can watch them racing,we come here<br/>
alot.They usually race on thursday nights starting at 6:00 p.m.The<br/>
