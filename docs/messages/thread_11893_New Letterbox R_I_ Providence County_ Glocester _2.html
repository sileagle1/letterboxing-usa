Location: Glocestor R.I.<br/>
Rated: easy<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Heading east on Rt. 44 it is 3.3 miles east of the Ct. &amp; <br/>
R.I. state line.  Take a right into the enterance across from Howie's <br/>
Sales &amp; Service.  It is unmarked gravel driveway with a parking lot <br/>
to the right.  This is the same starting point as the Burlingame <br/>
Reservoir Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Walk around the orange barrier and down the trail.  The path <br/>
bends right and left.  At the telephone pole with a red arrow on it <br/>
pointing staight ahead, count off 2 more telephone poles.  This pole <br/>
has the #355-41 on it.  Take a reading of 180 degrees.  Under a big <br/>
rock from the back right side is the Laurel Letterbox.  Continue on <br/>
the path.  Walk until you come to a telephone pole with spikes in <br/>
it.  Take a reading of 150 degrees and follow down to the stream.  <br/>
There will be a stone foundation on the right.  At the end of the <br/>
foundation, you'll see a big fallen tree.  Near the base of the tree <br/>
covered with sticks and a red brick is the Hardy Letterbox.  Please <br/>
rehide well.<br/>
