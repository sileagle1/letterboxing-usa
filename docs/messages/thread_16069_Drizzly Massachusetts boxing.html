checked out Emerson College, we were PSYCHED to find some Blue Hills letterboxes. <br/>
There's getting to be quite a gallery up there. The boxes were wonderful and <br/>
the hiking sublime: if you're ever in Red Sox territory during their annual <br/>
choke-fest, hit the Blue Hills! We found<br/>
<br/>
-Ponkapoag Turtle (have been meaning to get there for years. Saw our first <br/>
carnivorous plants in the wild, too)<br/>
-Two of the Time Traveler series by TeamGreenDragon (need to arrange a *BC* <br/>
visit so we can *go back in time* for the rest)<br/>
<br/>
Jay in CT, wondering who is going to pay for Emerson....hopefully our fellow <br/>
taxpayers<br/>
