What a great sport.<br/>
We had an awesome first day of letterboxing.  Thanks very much to the ADG,<br/>
psychomommy, the Squirrel<br/>
Girls and others for the wonderful boxes.<br/>
<br/>
The 8 boxes in Greenbrier are in great shape...what a beautiful park!!  I<br/>
think we were the first ones to stamp<br/>
into the Rupert Pawe Fault trilogy boxes, after all the stamps from the<br/>
planters.  The notebooks were just as neat as the boxes!  We have been on<br/>
the LBNA talk list for several weeks and so are pretty much up to speed on<br/>
everyone...at one point we had to navigate a flooded, muddy area and our 8<br/>
year old said, "don't pull a psychomommy!"...had to laugh at that!<br/>
<br/>
The Gambrill State Park box is in great shape...took us a little longer to<br/>
find this one as we, in our excitement, went south when we <br/>
should have gone north.<br/>
<br/>
The Washington Monument notebook is soaked and ruined...we tried to dry it<br/>
out and put another ziploc around it but it needs to<br/>
be replaced.<br/>
<br/>
We were unsuccessful in locating psychomommy's Lost Directions Mystery box<br/>
(I know, you said not to search during the week but we were right there and<br/>
couldn't resist!).<br/>
<br/>
My question is this...we are a military family and move fairly<br/>
frequently...we would like to plant some boxes but wonder what will happen<br/>
to them when we leave this area...we do seem to be in the vicinity of lots<br/>
of active letterboxers so perhaps if we plant some, they can be adopted out<br/>
when Uncle Sam says it is time to move on...opinions?<br/>

welcome!  <br/>
<br/>
I planted two boxes prior to my latest move.  One came<br/>
up missing just before we moved, and the other was<br/>
reported missing a few months after.  Another family<br/>
(also military, but unfortunately no longer on the<br/>
list)in the area used to check on them for me and give<br/>
me updates.  <br/>
<br/>
Finally, after the last box was reported missing I<br/>
decided to pull the clues.  Another boxer in the area<br/>
asked if she could recarve the stamps, revamp the<br/>
clues, replace them and take over maintenance- for<br/>
which I was grateful. I'm hoping they are still there,<br/>
but I haven't seen her post lately, either. <br/>
<br/>
I'd say it sounds like there are enough boxers in your<br/>
area that someone would probably volunteer to adopt<br/>
them once you leave if you ask.<br/>
<br/>
The more boxes the merrier.<br/>
