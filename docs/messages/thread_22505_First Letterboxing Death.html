can be deadly...<br/>
<br/>
But I just checked the statistics about places people<br/>
get killed or injured...and he's right, hikers do die<br/>
in the wild..sure...<br/>
<br/>
BUT.... THE most deadly place for Americans is in<br/>
their bathroom !<br/>
<br/>
THE place that most accidents occur by far !! is IN<br/>
THE BATHROOM...<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me the solution is obvious..for safety sake<br/>
...Heck I'm not gonna wash no more !<br/>
<br/>
Oh and the first item on my "what to take on a<br/>
letterboxing trip" ... I borrow my neighbours luxury<br/>
equipped "2006 Itasca Horizon Winnebego"...with<br/>
Jacuzzi hot tub(I'll risk it!) , plasma TV, 5+1<br/>
channel surround sound  and fully stocked wet<br/>
bar...makes the stresses of Letterboxing just that<br/>
"little" more bearable!<br/>
<br/>
Sigh....we adventurers all !<br/>

<br/>
Got your attention, didn't I? =)<br/>
<br/>
But seriously.... Silent Doug's comment about "These<br/>
are all<br/>
heartbreaking stories, and I'd be very happy to not<br/>
hear another one<br/>
in my lifetime...." I think we can all agree with that<br/>
sentiment, but<br/>
there is a particularly scary slant to consider:<br/>
<br/>
Someone will eventually die while letterboxing. Not<br/>
BECAUSE of<br/>
letterboxing, but while letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it will happen. Not if, but when.<br/>
<br/>
Anything you do that has more than a non-zero chance<br/>
of death (which,<br/>
let's face it, is anything you do--including doing<br/>
nothing!) will<br/>
EVENTUALLY cause a death. It's a number game,<br/>
essentially. Hikers die<br/>
every year out in the wild. So far, it's never<br/>
happened to a<br/>
letterboxer, but there are FAR more hikers than<br/>
letterboxers in the<br/>
general public. The numbers just haven't caught up<br/>
with us--yet.<br/>
<br/>
So look at what does kill or seriously injure people<br/>
in the wild who<br/>
aren't letterboxing, because those are the same issues<br/>
letterboxers<br/>
face. Even if you're an urban boxer, there are still<br/>
risks--car<br/>
accidents, muggings, drive-by shootings, etc. Just<br/>
sitting at home and<br/>
knitting puts you at risk of a meteorite shooting<br/>
through your roof<br/>
and killing you.<br/>
<br/>
There's not much you can do about meteors falling<br/>
through your roof<br/>
short of living in an underground bunker (which has<br/>
its own risks<br/>
anyhow!), but here's the thing: Most of those<br/>
incidents you hear about<br/>
on the news--lost hikers, hypothermia, drownings, and<br/>
such are<br/>
preventable. Pay attention to your surroundings, use a<br/>
little common<br/>
sense, don't push yourself past your abilities, and<br/>
don't take silly,<br/>
unnecessary risks. Nothing is more important than your<br/>
own safety, so<br/>
remember that first and formost. No letterbox is worth<br/>
endangering<br/>
yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Be safe--don't become a statistic. <br/>

He heard the statistic on the radio that most car accidents occur <br/>
