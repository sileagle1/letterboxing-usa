                    <div class="plaintext-content">We found all ten ants on July 26.  All were doing well, though Ant 10 <br/>
was quite exposed together with the Troll.  The big event for us was <br/>
accidentally discovering one of the Celestial series; we wish we'd <br/>
realized that this series was in the same spot, and we'd have picked <br/>
these up at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Ant #2 was a bit challenging and requires braving some Poison Ivy.  <br/>
Ant #3 was a bit longer walked than we anticipated but be patient.<br/>
<br/>
Plan on spending 2-3 hours picking up all ten.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

Seekyr, Blaze, and Mobius.<br/>
