                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well first off I do not object to paying for parking at our SP.  <br/>
Washington ranks 47th in the country in spending on its public <br/>
lands.  If this can help I don't mind.  It doesn't help the public to <br/>
now turn its backs on the park as the government has done since the <br/>
60's.<br/>
<br/>
The community of Pt Townsend has PAID for all the parking so there is <br/>
no parking fee at this venue.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry that the "authorities" have pulled the boxes.  I wonder if <br/>
it is because it is a historical site?  Can it be worked out?  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the city of Pt Townsend should ban spray paint as it <br/>
certainly has done more damage to this venue than 5 letterboxes ever <br/>
would.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congratulations.  Our SP Rangers are very a protective lot.  They <br/>
take their parks very seriously and want to do everything to stay on <br/>
the good side of those who sign their checks ( many of whom have <br/>
never been to the park :-p )<br/>
<br/>
Our Ranger at Bridle Trails was thrilled with the presence of the <br/>
LB.  She signed into the log book using the stamp that they use for <br/>
the Junior Ranger Program.  It is quite a nice one, each stamp <br/>
specific for the park.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to returning when the LB's are back in place and <br/>
finding them at last.  I hope Amanda will do the same.<br/>
<br/>
I was disheartened to see all the graffiti on the historic <br/>
buildings.  I am sure it troubles the park staff as well.<br/>
<br/>
It is nice that the community of Pt Townsend supports the park by <br/>
financing the parking fee.  This community is suffering with the <br/>
current economy and unemployment.  They recognize the importance of <br/>
that park.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder who I can tweak in the community of Bellevue /Kirkland / <br/>
Redmond to do the same for Bridle Trails.  Hummm who do we know there <br/>
who has money????<br/>

I've heard rumors that Bill Gates lives in the area, but I don't <br/>
think he's much of an outdoors kind of person.  He looks like he <br/>
might have a heart-attack if he tried something as 'strenuous' as <br/>
Bridle Trails.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
That would be kind of cool, though, bumping into Bill Gates on the <br/>
trails.  It would be even more cool if he had a stamp and some clues <br/>
wandering around the trails....  I haven't seen him logging into any <br/>
boxes, though!<br/>
