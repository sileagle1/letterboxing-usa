Sounds like Cowboy and Cody had a great time despite being wet. To <br/>
end the day at KJ is always a delight for the youngsters.I bet you <br/>
had a great time too. We were suppose to head out on the trials <br/>
yesterday, but by the time church got out, it was time for Little <br/>
Bears nap and by time she woke up it was 3:45, a little late to get <br/>
started. I had all my clues ready. Maybe we will have better luck this <br/>
weekend. <br/>
Happy Boxing.<br/>
