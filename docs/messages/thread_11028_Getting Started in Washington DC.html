The piece(s) of information I am most interested in now is creating a<br/>
stamp so I can mark books that people have left.<br/>

I live in the Washington DC metro area (specifically, Fairfax) and was<br/>
wondering if anyone could suggest a good store where I could buy a<br/>
high quality stamp which I could then carve.<br/>

(online stores could be useful as well, but I was hoping to pick<br/>
something up soon)<br/>

Pointers to tutorial/tips for doing the actual carving (I'm not an<br/>
art-inclined person) would be helpful as well.<br/>

It is! You're lucky to have a lot of boxes nearby just waiting to be found.<br/>
<br/>

I didn't think I was very art-inclined before I carved my first stamps, <br/>
either. I still consider myself a bit creatively challenged, but my stamps <br/>
(while not masterpieces in any way) have turned out a lot better than I <br/>
anticipated. You might be surprised by what you can create. Let go of your <br/>
expectations, have fun with the carving and see what happens. :-)<br/>
<br/>
This is a great place to find links on all sorts of basic letterboxing <br/>
topics if you're just starting out:<br/>

You can try the Total Crafts stores - they have a stamp section but you usually have to ask for carving meduim and tools.  I got an excellent kit there and it has worked well for me but I have mostly saved the pink stuff and ended up doing a lot of my stamps on white erasers from the Dollar Store.  On letterboxing.org there's a link to Der Mad Stamper's page and that's where I got my "training and inspiration".</body></html>
