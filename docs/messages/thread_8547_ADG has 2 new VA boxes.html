It's almost magical - the Celtic Pride gals were just talking about <br/>
Fountainhead Park and, poof, there you are with your boxes.  It's <br/>
another great day in Virginia.<br/>

&gt; 2 Fountainhead State Park boxes <br/>
&gt; Near Occoquan, VA, Fairfax Co<br/>
&gt; Park occasionally closed due to weather or events (703-250-9124)<br/>
&gt; Placed October 20, 2002<br/>
&gt; From the Apple Dumpling Gang<br/>
&gt; Difficulty: Moderate hike on well blazed horse trails, about 4 <br/>
miles <br/>
&gt; round trip<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From 123 south (Old Ox Rd), take a right on Hampton Rd and follow <br/>
&gt; signs to the park entrance on the left.  Fountainhead has lots of <br/>
&gt; specialty areas like a designated mountain bike trail, archery <br/>
range, <br/>
&gt; swimming, equestrian trails and even mini golf.  Please follow all <br/>
&gt; signs in the park as some areas are not safe to walk in.  There are <br/>
&gt; bathrooms, picnic pavilions and soda machines for your convenience.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mother Nature's Weaver<br/>
&gt; Park in the first lot on the right and begin your hike at the trail <br/>
&gt; sign in box at the far right corner of the parking lot.  The trail <br/>
&gt; entrance is marked by a set of split rail fences (do not start at <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; set behind the Bull Run sign).  See the blue horse shoe blazes?  <br/>
You <br/>
&gt; will follow this trail to both boxes. At the first two fork's you <br/>
&gt; find, go right at both. Follow the blue trail along a fenced in <br/>
&gt; maintenance area on your left and at the next fork, go right again, <br/>
&gt; following the blue trail parallel to the road you drove in on. Keep <br/>
&gt; going past a twisted tree that has fallen over the trail.  Shortly <br/>
&gt; the trail will take a sharp left turn away from the road and along <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; small dry stream bed.  A few yards more and you will be stepping <br/>
over <br/>
&gt; some small fallen logs.  If you look to your left you will see a <br/>
most <br/>
&gt; unusual tree.  It is shaped like a perfect backwards number 4!  <br/>
&gt; Mother Nature's Weaver is behind the tree under a white rock.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A Boxer's gotta box!<br/>
&gt; Continue down the blue trail.  At the fork in the road, follow the <br/>
&gt; blue trail to the right and across the road.  (From this point your <br/>
&gt; prize is about a 20-25 min hike at a good pace)  As you cross back <br/>
&gt; into the woods you will see "Danger archery range" red signs on the <br/>
&gt; right side of the trail.  You are fine on the blue trail, but <br/>
please <br/>
&gt; do not wander off to the right (there are no boxes down there!).  <br/>
As <br/>
&gt; you continue on the blue trail eventually it will turn to the left <br/>
&gt; away from the archery range and head down a large hill.  Climb up <br/>
&gt; another big hill and back down again.  As you start to get near the <br/>
&gt; road again the blue trail will take a sharp right and run along a <br/>
&gt; deep gully to the left of the trail.  A short way down this part of <br/>
&gt; the trail, you will spot a very gnarled tree on the left.  Looking <br/>
&gt; southwest from this tree, spot the next tree with a blue blaze and <br/>
an <br/>
&gt; arrow pointing right.  The Boxer is behind that tree under some <br/>
rocks <br/>
&gt; and sticks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The blue trail you are on is a 6 mile loop trail, so if your <br/>
feeling <br/>
&gt; ambitious you can continue on or backtrack to the road and walk to <br/>
&gt; your car from there.<br/>
