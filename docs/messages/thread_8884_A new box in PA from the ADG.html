boxes this weekend when Cat and Sarah visited Allentown.  We hope the <br/>
local boxers in PA like our offering and will come for more in MD and <br/>

West Park is located on Turner and Linden streets, between 15th and <br/>
16th.  Enjoy looking around the neighborhood here too, there is some <br/>
amazing architecture and wonderful homes.<br/>
<br/>
Rumor has it that John loved to walk alone in West Park on cool <br/>
autumn days and look at the trees.  He usually started at the band <br/>
shell and walk across the grass to the tall Victorian fountain.  <br/>
There is a circular cement path around the fountain with four spurs.  <br/>
Today he took the second path to the left and wandered past his <br/>
favorite large tree with white peeling bark.  At the next circular <br/>
area John took the second path to the right.  At the T he took a left <br/>
and then the next right.  He followed this sidewalk towards the <br/>
fence.  Where the slated picket fence meets a taller privacy fence, <br/>
he looked down behind the left edge of the privacy fence, and found a <br/>
perfect hiding place for his letterbox, under a few rocks and a scrap <br/>
of concrete!  Now there was another reason to visit the park.<br/>
