<br/>
Rustypuff and I just got back from a few days in Rochester, visiting <br/>
my family for the holidays.  While there, we were able to indulge in <br/>
a little bit of letterboxing activity.<br/>
<br/>
First, we exchanged stamps with my niece and nephew.  We had given <br/>
them letterboxing kits on our last visit two years ago, but they <br/>
hadn't had the opportunity to put them to use.  Now, with a willing <br/>
uncle to drive them, they picked trail names, Horse Girl and Sox fan <br/>
in NY, and we set out to get them started in the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Our first stop was the home of Roc'n Ron where we exchanged stamps <br/>
with Ron and The Dancer.  Ron was also gracious enough to supply us <br/>
with a copy of the clue for Ad Astra to the Stars, as well as some <br/>
advice about boxes we were likely to find.  Thanks, Ron!<br/>
<br/>
Next we went looking for a mystery box, but it eluded us.  Although <br/>
not noted in the clue, we suspect it was a temporary box.<br/>
<br/>
Our next attempt was successful, as Ad Astra to the Stars fell easily <br/>
into our hands.  In addition, we found a hitchhiker there.<br/>
<br/>
Our last attempt, Blue Cut Marsh in Newark, was another <br/>
disappointment.  The park displayed signs of both extensive damage <br/>
from last April's ice storms, and resulting rehab and re-routing of <br/>
trails.  The box may be there, but some of the landmarks listed in <br/>
the clue seem to have been destroyed, hidden, or removed.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the two unfound boxes, we counted our day as a success.  <br/>
Horse Girl and Sox Fan in NY are looking forward to finding more <br/>
boxes, and to placing their own.  Even their father seemed to be <br/>
showing some interest when he heard our stories upon our return.<br/>
<br/>
Box on,<br/>
