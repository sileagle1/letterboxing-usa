experience, and what we found was truly inspiring to keep boxing, AND <br/>
to plant boxes ourselves-- many thanks to FOX 412 and everyone else <br/>
who helps to make this such a wonderful pasttime. We've only been at <br/>
it since March of this year and have already met several wonderful <br/>
people, and have hiked in places we otherwise would never have gone <br/>
to--- Happy Boxing Everyone!!--Sunshine and Swamp Yankee :0)<br/>
