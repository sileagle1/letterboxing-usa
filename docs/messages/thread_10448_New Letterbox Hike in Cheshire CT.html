Name of Boxes: A Roaring K.I.M. (Kids In Mind) Hike, Boxes 1-5 <br/>
Placed: October 2002<br/>
Located in Cheshire, Connecticut, New Haven County at Roaring Brook <br/>
Park<br/>
<br/>
These wonderful letter boxes have little historical bits of <br/>
information on the park and the waterfalls written on the front <br/>
inside cover of the book.  To get the whole story and to complete the <br/>
poem find all five letter boxes with their fantastic stamps to help <br/>
tell the story.  To get to Roaring Brook Park, take rt. 10 in <br/>
Cheshire to rt. 42.  Go west on rt. 42 to Mountain Rd.  Take a right <br/>
onto Mountain Rd.  Go to Roaring Brook Rd. (Second left once on <br/>
Mountain Rd.)  Follow Roaring Brook Rd. to gate.  Small parking area <br/>
in on the right.  Trail map is posted on sign at this area.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Follow "road" on foot through the ponds before starting clues.<br/>
Box #1: Stand in front of the Roaring Brook Park blue sign.  Walk ten <br/>
steps down the path.  Look right.  There is a pile of rocks to your <br/>
right.  Look under the rocks.<br/>
<br/>
Box #2: Continue up the path to the Orange Trail sign on the left.  <br/>
Follow the trail past a large stone chimney on your left.  Continue <br/>
on the trail over two bridges.  Once over the second bridge look for <br/>
a big tree on the left. Look down at the base of the tree.  There is <br/>
a stone wall.  The box should be hidden at the base of the tree on <br/>
the left side.<br/>
<br/>
Box # 3: Continue along the orange trail past Thomas P. Poll's <br/>
memorial stone.  Climb the steep hill with a "staircase."  At the <br/>
14th step, turn left.  There should be a big tree to your left split <br/>
into a "V." Look in the "V."<br/>
<br/>
Box # 4: Continue on up to the rest area at the "Big Falls."  After <br/>
viewing the falls, the path takes a left up a small hill -- look for <br/>
the third tree on the right with rotting base. Look there.<br/>
<br/>
Box # 5: Walk on up to the "campfire."  Standing at the campfire, <br/>
head off 30 child's size paces in a 140 degree southeasterly <br/>
direction.  Find the box tucked in a rock wall    <br/>
