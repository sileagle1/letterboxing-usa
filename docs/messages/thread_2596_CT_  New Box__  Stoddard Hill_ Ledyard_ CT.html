                    <div class="plaintext-content">1 box at Stoddard Hill State Park, Ledyard, CT (New<br/>
London county)<br/>
<br/>
Terrain: short walk, with moderately steep climbs<br/>
Clues: easy<br/>
Time: about 30 to 45 minutes<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS: Driving north on Route 12 from Groton, CT,<br/>
pass the junction with Route 214. Continue for 0.5<br/>
mile, to find the brown state park sign for Stoddard<br/>
Hill State Park on the left side of the road. Park in<br/>
front of the picnic area.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES: Walk uphill to the left (340 degrees) on faint<br/>
path through the grassy area. At the top of the hill,<br/>
keep right. Pass an old cemetary with gravestones<br/>
dating back to 1776 (Revolutionary War!). Continue<br/>
with a high wall of boulders on your right and the<br/>
river on your left. At a faint "Y" in the path, keep<br/>
right to climb sharply uphill (120 degrees). The path<br/>
levels out, then gets steep again. At the top, veer<br/>
right again, and now you are heading back in the<br/>
direction you came, but at a higher elevation. This<br/>
path brings you to a rocky area that is high above the<br/>
wall of boulders that you just passed.  Now you are in<br/>
the right general area, but which rock is it under??<br/>
To orient yourself, stand at the highest point, facing<br/>
the river. On your left is a large tree that appears,<br/>
from this angle, to be growing directly out of the<br/>
rock. The rock you are interested in is directly in<br/>
front of you at 270 degrees, nearest the edge of the<br/>
cliff. Instead of heading directly to it, go around to<br/>
the right and approach it from the side. There is a<br/>
double beech tree (I think it is a beech, I'm not very<br/>
good at identifying trees!), and another tree of the<br/>
same type that has initials carved into it. Look<br/>
between these two trees, under the rock.<br/>
<br/>
RETURN: Continuing on the same path, past the rocky<br/>
area, the trail gradually slopes downward to bring you<br/>
out at the back of the cemetary that you passed on the<br/>
way in. From here, retrace your steps to the parking<br/>
lot.<br/>
