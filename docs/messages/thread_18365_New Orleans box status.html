                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, perfect timing!  We're headed to the Big Easy in about a <br/>
month.  Can't wait--glad there's something there to look for.  We're <br/>
still trying to sort out dates for our trip (as it revolves around a <br/>
business conference 13-16 May) but if anybody will be available for <br/>
exchanging signature stamps, we'd love to meet up!  We're thinking <br/>
about coming out around 8-10 May depending upon plane tix, fares and <br/>
finding reasonable hotel rates in the region.  Let us know if you're <br/>
interested in getting together.  We won't have a car--so we'll be <br/>
stuck in and around the trolley line...<br/>

Hey, armyswmr99 (from Central TX) will meet up with us, too!!!<br/>
