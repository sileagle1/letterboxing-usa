I agree with you as most of the distances are short and USGS maps are <br/>
usually not needed. I just wanted to get a make sure that I give my <br/>
clues in a system that is generally used by LB'ers. I don't want to <br/>
confuse things because I use a different system.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>

<br/>
As one mapping profesional to another, when I search, I read the clues <br/>
with the attitude that they were written by somebody who wasn't <br/>
trained to describe things like an outdoor professional.  ie, calling <br/>
a forked tree a tree that's split in half.  When I read that I assume <br/>
they're talking about a tree that was split in half by lightning.  <br/>
Being that this is not a professional endeaver and lives and <br/>
livelihoods are not dependent on it, it's not to big a deal.  <br/>
<br/>
However, I must say that no matter how hard a clue is, it has to make <br/>
some kind of sense to a normal thinking person once the pieces are in <br/>
place.  There are some placers who think that because they make a <br/>
connection, everyone else should when that's not possible without <br/>
psychoanalizing them.  The hardest mystery box I've found was deepest <br/>
NJ.  It took me more than a year, but when I found the pieces, it made <br/>
perfect sense.  <br/>

The opposite is true.  Assume magnetic north unless told otherwise.  I<br/>
too have my compass declinated to True North, and find I have to<br/>
adjust the 15 degrees 95% of the time.  Matter-of-fact, I'm<br/>
considering undeclinating my compass to make it easier.<br/>

<br/>
What do YOU consider to be key features of a good<br/>
compass?  What features are NOT good or unnecessary?<br/>
<br/>
Would you recommend a specific type of<br/>
compass/specific brand?<br/>
<br/>
What do you think is the minimum you would have to<br/>
spend to get a reasonably good compass?<br/>
<br/>
Here's where I am coming from:  In addition to being a<br/>
letterboxer, I'm also a scouter, and while I use a<br/>
compass in both of those pursuits, there is no chance<br/>
I would need one professionally in the foreseeable<br/>
future.  I am willing to spend more on my own compass,<br/>
especially if it means I can do a better job of<br/>
teaching compass skills.  I would also like to be able<br/>
to either purchase or recommend a solid compass for<br/>
older cub scouts (10-11 year olds).  I don't support<br/>
the idea of buying cheap because they are boys - I<br/>
think it's important to give them a reasonably good<br/>
piece of equipment to learn on.<br/>
<br/>
I know this discussion has been covered before, but<br/>
it's been awhile and it doesn't hurt to revisit it<br/>
occasionally.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You don't have to spend too much.  My compass is a Silva Ranger <br/>
which cost around  $50.  You could get a decent one for between $12 <br/>
and $25.  The silva explorer is what I used when I was a scout.  <br/>
Most of the "baseplate" type compasses are good because they can be <br/>
used more easily with maps.  <br/>
<br/>
Other than that you'd want a 360 degree azimuth dial with 2 degree <br/>
calibrations.  Don't let anybody fool you.  You can't read any more <br/>
accurately than that with a hand compass.  The baseplate has a <br/>
direction of travel arrow.  Also, there are some compasses that have <br/>
declination scales to estimate true bearings.  Some compasses, like <br/>
mine, allow you to actually set declination so that you're always <br/>
working in true north in a particular area.  Those compasses are <br/>
more expensive.  I'm involved with Search &amp; Rescue and I always keep <br/>
mine set for TN.  However, you have to remember to reset it when you <br/>
go to another area.  It's also good to have a compass that is liquid <br/>
filled to prevent the needle from shaking too much.  Make sure to <br/>
have a laniard to keep in around your neck where it's available for <br/>
easy readings.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that was helpfull.  <br/>

&gt; they're talking about a tree that was split in half by lightning.  <br/>
&gt; Being that this is not a professional endeaver and lives and <br/>
&gt; livelihoods are not dependent on it, it's not to big a deal.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, I must say that no matter how hard a clue is, it has to <br/>
make <br/>
&gt; some kind of sense to a normal thinking person once the pieces are <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; place.  There are some placers who think that because they make a <br/>
&gt; connection, everyone else should when that's not possible without <br/>
&gt; psychoanalizing them.  The hardest mystery box I've found was <br/>
deepest <br/>
&gt; NJ.  It took me more than a year, but when I found the pieces, it <br/>
made <br/>
&gt; perfect sense.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yep...it's useful.  I'v used several different models<br/>
of Silva compasses, but I've wondered if I didn't need<br/>
to look a little harder at other brands or types.  <br/>
<br/>
I had one recently that seemed to start sticking.  I<br/>
only noticed it after someone questioned some clues I<br/>
wrote and I got to looking at the compass and noticed<br/>
it didn't float freely.  I have no idea whether it<br/>
developed a small leak or what, but I threw it away so<br/>
I wouldn't try to use it again.  <br/>
<br/>
I bought my kids the blue Silva with a compass,<br/>
thermometer and whistle - I haven't quite figured out<br/>
why the thermometer is important, but I liked the idea<br/>
of them having a compass and a whistle together.  I've<br/>
noticed though, that the compasses don't react quite<br/>
like my compass that I really like.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband has had his eye on a $100 lensatic - who<br/>
knows why, except that it would be a new playtoy!<br/>

&gt; Okay you professional compass folks:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do YOU consider to be key features of a good<br/>
&gt; compass?  What features are NOT good or unnecessary?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Would you recommend a specific type of<br/>
&gt; compass/specific brand?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do you think is the minimum you would have to<br/>
&gt; spend to get a reasonably good compass?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here's where I am coming from:  In addition to being a<br/>
&gt; letterboxer, I'm also a scouter, and while I use a<br/>
&gt; compass in both of those pursuits, there is no chance<br/>
&gt; I would need one professionally in the foreseeable<br/>
&gt; future.  I am willing to spend more on my own compass,<br/>
&gt; especially if it means I can do a better job of<br/>
&gt; teaching compass skills.  I would also like to be able<br/>
&gt; to either purchase or recommend a solid compass for<br/>
&gt; older cub scouts (10-11 year olds).  I don't support<br/>
&gt; the idea of buying cheap because they are boys - I<br/>
&gt; think it's important to give them a reasonably good<br/>
&gt; piece of equipment to learn on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know this discussion has been covered before, but<br/>
&gt; it's been awhile and it doesn't hurt to revisit it<br/>
&gt; occasionally.<br/>

Actually I went in for "trinkets" as a teeny weeny.  Still have them all.  I<br/>
carry a couple of old Cracker Jack compasses in my glove box.  Just in case<br/>
I leave home without my "real" one.  I get lost.  I also forget and leave<br/>
things at home.  JC compasses have worked just fine so far.  I don't know<br/>
whether that says something about me as a finder or something about the<br/>
placer. :-) Or something about Cracker Jack.<br/>
<br/>
One of my most memorable hours was having a cop pull over behind me on a<br/>
highway.  He came up to my window, thinking I was having truck trouble.  I<br/>
said nope, I was just temporarily lost, just checking my compass.  His eyes<br/>
bugged out better than if he'd spotted a hundred kilos of cocaine in my<br/>
truck.  He said "Holy! That's a Cracker Jack!"  I said yep, sure was.  He<br/>
said "Does it work?!?"  I said yep, sure does.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Don't be confused.  Compasses point to magnetic north, which is not <br/>
actually at the North Pole.  Magnetic North is southeast of the <br/>
North Pole by several hundred miles.  Therefore, depending on where <br/>
you are looking at a compass, there is a "true" north which is the <br/>
North Pole (and what maps would be using), and  a "magnetic" north <br/>
which could be as much as 30 degrees or more different.<br/>
<br/>
Are you really confused now?  I would assume most clues would be <br/>
based on magnetic North, as others have said.<br/>
