<br/>
Just wanted to let you know that SunvalleySu, JoltionJess and <br/>
Jakizard finally found Charge.  We tried last October but didn't get <br/>
that we needed to cross the river so we didn't get the find!<br/>
<br/>
This time we found a low water cement bridge and even though the <br/>
freezing cold water was rushing across it we waded on over in our <br/>
sandals.  Of course, par for the LB course (or curse) as soon as we <br/>
got across we heard the thunder start and by the time we got to the <br/>
box the heavens opened up.  My kids are convinced that Letterboxing <br/>
will end a drought.  <br/>
<br/>
We were the first finders!  We also found the Silver Bullet HH which <br/>
will travel with us next weekend across state lines!  Thanks for <br/>
planting one in our backyard.  We are doing our best to up the <br/>
numbers in the Shenandoah Valley.  Plant them and they will come!<br/>
<br/>
Box on,<br/>
SunvalleySu<br/>
