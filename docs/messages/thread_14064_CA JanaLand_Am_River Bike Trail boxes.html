stamped in our new Best of Davis series. So, like good letterboxers that we are, <br/>
we returned the favor and sought out her American River Bike Trail series. <br/>
Great stamps--not to be missed!! Very doable, good clues too. <br/>
<br/>
The only bad part was that Funhog had been the first to stamp in and had <br/>
planted an HH, then "nebiru" stamped in a claimed it just before us!! Would LOVE <br/>
to have had another HH! Oh well. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great series!<br/>
