word of caution to make sure that rubbings are allowed of whatever you want<br/>
folks to take the rubbings of.  For example, the last time I was in<br/>
Salisbury, they have several fantastic items over there very suitable for<br/>
some beautiful rubbings.  Rubbings were allowed with some and not with<br/>
others, and with still other items, people could buy rubbings but they<br/>
couldn't make them themselves.  So, even if you didn't mention letterboxing,<br/>
I would just quietly find out if a rubbing is allowed of whatever plaque or<br/>
art you'd be using.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, do not pick your nose in London unless you're OK with it showing up on<br/>
a TV camera someplace.  :-)<br/>

Trafalger square. It is one of my favorite places. I've spent hours in there. My daughter and <br/>
I did a rubbing of the very large knight in there, it took 5 hours, it was pouring rain <br/>
outside.<br/>
And don't take my word as gospel, some places may alow rubbings. I think your idea has <br/>
potential and would apeal to me.<br/>

Ooh, wait. How would you know who's visited the site?<br/>
Would there be a logbook anywhere? Because half the fun<br/>
of letterboxing is seeing everyone else's stamps.<br/>
<br/>
If you do plant one of these boxes, please post back to the <br/>
group and let us know how it goes. (And most definitely let<br/>
us know where it is so we can be sure to go find it if we get<br/>
to London!)<br/>

Don't take my words about not alowing rubbings as the gospel truth or as a <br/>

shoots of the original concept of letterboxing, postals, virtuals for example. And i'm sure <br/>
there will be more to come.<br/>

I do rubbings all the time - in fact have a "rubbing journal" just  <br/>
for rubbing that I do when I travel....<br/>

I wouldn't rub something valuable, or historical - but there are lots  <br/>
of "everyday" signs and objects that could be utilized and rubbed if  <br/>
a planter wanted to do this.<br/>
In fact, once you start noticing - the whole world seems to be  <br/>
"rubable" without rubbing something old, historical and valuable.<br/>
