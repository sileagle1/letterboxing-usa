box and moved it.  When I wrote to her thanking her for letting me <br/>
know that she moved it but that really it was supposed to stay where <br/>
I put it, she said "the instructions on the box said log in and re-<br/>
hide the box.  I thought I was supposed to hide it in a new place."<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'll need to be more precise in my directions.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if the log is there or not. She said there was a spiral <br/>
notebook, which I don't use, and a stamp of a chicken.  A hitchhiker <br/>
maybe?  Right now I'm just hoping someone will rescue poor Pogo and <br/>
put him back in the camelia garden.  <br/>
