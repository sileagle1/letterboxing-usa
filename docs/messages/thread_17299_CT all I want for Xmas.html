<br/>
All I want for Xmas is someone to find my very first letterbox. :) <br/>
The Baltic Mill Letterbox (Sprague, CT) is still out there. I checked <br/>
it today, and even though it has been out for MONTHS, nobody's put <br/>
the first stamp in it. Since it is season of giving, I want everyone <br/>
to know that the stamp is handcarved, the stamp book is home made, <br/>
and there is a humble but festive "first finders" certificate in it.<br/>
<br/>
I know you guys can find it. I even taunt you with this--the start <br/>
point is marked on every topo map since 1950. Tis the season HEE HEE.<br/>
