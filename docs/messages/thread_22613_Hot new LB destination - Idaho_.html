                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just sending in a quick report from our recent trip to Idaho.  Who would have <br/>
thought that such a small group of far-flung letterboxers could create such a <br/>
treasure trove of delightful boxes!  Soon after we landed, we were enjoying <br/>
sampling the chocolates and smelling the roses in the Boise area, traipsing <br/>
along the "woodsy" river for which that city is named, and finding a variety of <br/>
cute carvings by A-Bear, Blackvelvetrav, Lizman, and WD'A, whom we were <br/>
glad to meet for exchanges as well!  <br/>
<br/>
Then we headed up into the Sawtooth Mountains for some hiking and <br/>
camping before attempting to climb the state high point, Borah Peak, which <br/>
was to be our next to last state high point "close approach" - save for Denali in <br/>
Alaska.  We got hailed and snowed out even before reaching "Chicken-Out <br/>
Ridge", but had a great time anyway, and even left a little "RI Red" chicken up <br/>
there about half a mile as our letterboxing memento!<br/>
<br/>
Next we drove down to the black lava area of south central Idaho to spend a <br/>
hot fun afternoon rocking and caving with Cadenza on the Craters Of The <br/>
Moon, after finding her finely Land Of The Yankee Fork series up in the cool <br/>
mountains the day before.  We then swung back up into the frosty mountains <br/>
north of Sun Valley for a bit more hiking, camping and exploring before <br/>
beginning our final descent to Boise and one more big day of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
We ended up finding well over 100 boxes in just a few days, and only wish we <br/>
had more time for some of the many other nearby boxes we simply could not <br/>
get to on such a short visit.  Now we are already hoping to get back and make <br/>
a bigger loop through Idaho, Montana and Utah in a couple of years.  <br/>
Meanwhile, thanks so much to that prolific little bunch of Idaho letterboxers <br/>
who helped make our trip so pleasant, and especially to A-Bear and J-Bear, <br/>
who joined the ranks of such such legendary letterboxing hosts as the <br/>
Doubtful Guests of VA, Don and Gwen of CA, Scout Dogs of IN, Mountain <br/>
Scorpia of NC, and many other fine folks all over who have shown us such <br/>
great hospitality as we letterbox our way around the country.  Many thanks to <br/>
you all!<br/>
