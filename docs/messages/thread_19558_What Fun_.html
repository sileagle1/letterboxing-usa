  On Tuesday, I read the article in TIME Magazine. This Friday morning, I  <br/>
  found my first two letterboxes. However, I didn't have a pen with me so I could  <br/>
  not leave the date and where I'm from. My question is: Have any FBI agents ever <br/>
  confronted any of you during your covert activities? I certainly had many <br/>
  park  maintenance people watching my curious activity and I felt sure they  were <br/>
  going to call the authorities.<br/>
