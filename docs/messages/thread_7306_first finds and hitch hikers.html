                    <html><body>I had such a great day!  Went to two parks in MD that I'd never been to before and was the first finder of four different boxes  AND I found my very first hitch hiker!  In addition to all this fun, I am also pleased to announce that I have my very first case of poison ivy, making my ankles very itchy!<br/>
<br/>
I started my journey at Black Hill Regional Park where I found The Two Squirrels Black Hill Shore Box.  The park was very busy, but the box was in a nice secluded place with a view of the lake.  <br/>
<br/>
Then it was off to Burkittsville, MD where I found all three of the South Mountain Trinity boxes placed by the Apple Dumpling Gang.  What a great place.  Very historical with lots of really cool things to look at.  These are the first boxes I've ever found that the log books were as beautiful as the stamps.   I want to take art lessons from the Apple Dumpling Gang!  The stamps and the books were great.<br/>
<br/>
And the bonus was that I found the hitch hiker "Honda Road Again" in the third box!  I was so excited - my first hitch hiker!  Woo Hoo!  Now, where to place it.....<br/>
<br/>
So, four first finds, first hitch hiker, poison ivy and I also won a free coke today.  Can't beat that for a good day!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the e-mail!  We are beside ourselves that you enjoyed the <br/>
boxes so much.  You deserve the hitcher for making that last hike!  <br/>
<br/>
Sarah is beaming with pride!  She is quite an artist and already has <br/>
4 stamps ready to be placed.  If we weren't so beat from boxing we <br/>
would be out there placing boxes today.<br/>
<br/>
Rest assured that more are coming soon.  Sorry you got poison ivy.  <br/>
Sounds like it was worth it though.  Hope to meet you at the upcoming <br/>
East Coast gathering.<br/>
