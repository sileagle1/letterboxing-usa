You don't trade the actual stamp...just the stamp image.<br/>
<br/>
So if we met you would get my "Peppermint Patti" stamp in your book and I would get your personal stamp image in mine! To remember that we met! :)<br/>

No, Jena, it is even more strenuous than that. You must immediately <br/>
exchange your log, your clothing, your credit cards, and even your <br/>
car keys. Now you must live as the other person until you can find <br/>
another letterboxer on the trail. Then you get to enforce the same <br/>
thing upon them. So pick wisely and well.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I drive an Olds Aurora, have 59 finds, but work at a nuclear <br/>
power plant. Hope you don't have dachshunds!<br/>

&gt; --Mahjong<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Let's see: I've been a pauper, a puppet, a pawn, and a king...<br/>
<br/>
I started out as a prelaw student. Switched out of that really <br/>
quickly when I saw what lawyers do. <br/>
<br/>
Next, I happened upon a young Army recruit. Wound up in Vietnam, not <br/>
a good choice.<br/>
<br/>
Switched back into the body of a biology major. Got the BS and MS <br/>
degrees and got really tired of hurting mice in PhD research.<br/>
<br/>
Switched into a Health Physicist. Got an exciting trip up to help <br/>
recover the mess at Three Mile Island.<br/>
<br/>
After tiring of the long hours (10 hr days, 7 days a week), I found a <br/>
body of a teacher at a technical junior college in Texas. That was a <br/>
sweet gig.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I was hijacked to another body where I found myself in <br/>
Louisiana designing training for a reactor. I learned to bite the <br/>
tails and suck the heads on dem crawfish.<br/>
<br/>
I found a letterboxer hitchhiking to California and I managed to wind <br/>
up here on the coast. Now I teach at a nice reactor, beautiful but <br/>
expensive area where I can not afford a house, plant stamps with <br/>
JugglerMouse, Emily the Rose, Sade from Nebraska, Pandora, and of <br/>
course Ash Raven. Pretty sweet deal but I may now start having to <br/>
feed those danged toy poodles. Gack!<br/>
