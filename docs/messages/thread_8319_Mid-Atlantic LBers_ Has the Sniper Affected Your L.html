can't believe this craziness! How sick, how sad. My brother just moved from 
Manassas, VA to Nebraska about 2 months ago. The shooting in Manassas was a 
short distance from their home and they often did their shopping and got their 
gas right there. The one today just outside of Fredricksburg was just one exit 
from where my brother worked. It is mind boggling. Well this really had nothing 
to do with your question. I just started ranting. </span></div>

    If on the remote chance that a letterbox was found, they would <br/>

    I'm not going to let anything stop me from my day to day living. <br/>
Yes, it's in my mind but I don't live close to Interstate 95. I could <br/>
get killed in a car accident before getting shot by some crazed <br/>
sniper. Take for instance those 9 people in Wisconsin (I think that's <br/>
the state) that were killed today in a fog related pile-up and <br/>
explosion. Both situations are horrible. I'm just not going to live <br/>
in fear. Fear will make you crazy.   <br/>

be focusing on "suburban/urban" activities such as going to shopping centers <br/>
and gas stations.  So, you would think the woods are safe (but then, there <br/>
was that note about the hunters....).  Who knows.  They believe that he is <br/>
responding to what the media suggests.  So, if they mention that crowded <br/>
events, for example, appear safer (although almost everything has been <br/>
cancelled) he may turn around and head there just to spite them.  That is <br/>
what the rumor mill is suggesting about the "out of character" attack on the <br/>
school child.<br/>

Whether you go about your business or not, though, I doubt there is one <br/>
individual who doesn't have worries in the back of their minds.  Just adding <br/>
one more worry (did I see a white box truck?!....) to the seemingly growing <br/>
list.  That is why it is especially nice to gather the family and go looking <br/>
for a little treasure along a leafy path.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just returned from a week long trip to the East Coast (I live in <br/>
the greater Seattle area) and spent a lot of the time within the <br/>
current sniper-affected areas.  It did cause me to think twice about <br/>
venturing out for some LBs but I decided I wasn't going to <br/>
let 'them' run my life; that in itself is a form of terrorism!  <br/>
Several times yesterday and the day before that, I traveled past the <br/>
school where the young boy was shot last week in Bowie and it caused <br/>
me to reflect on the situation, say a prayer for him, his family and <br/>
the other victims and their families, but I continued to the park <br/>
where I was planning on looking for some boxes.  There are four <br/>
letterboxes about 1 mile from that particular school.  Yes, we were <br/>
extremely concerned about the situation but life must continue...<br/>
<br/>
See you on the letterboxing trail...<br/>

Finally bagged some East Coast boxes (10 but no HHs)!!!  Was even <br/>
first finder for one that was placed many moons ago!!!  ;)  Solved <br/>
many mystery boxes in the process but ran out of time in the <br/>
area...  :(  <br/>
<br/>
So many boxes, so little time!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Bethany,  I was wondering how you were doing on the east <br/>
coast.  I remembered that you were planning a trip out there just <br/>
this week.  I also have missed your many new plants.  We havent <br/>
seen much activity out here since you had your big run a few <br/>
weeks ago.  I had planned to get out and get some of those <br/>
boxes you put out but we have been franticly working in the yard <br/>
getting ready for winter.  Our family is leaving tomorrow for a <br/>
short vacation in Sun River Oregon near Bend and  plan to check <br/>
out some of Funhog's boxes.  Hopefully we can get some time <br/>
next weekend to place a box or two for the South Sound <br/>
gathering.  My boys have been going wild with carving.  Now we <br/>
just need to get out there and plant some boxes.   I also have an <br/>
idea for a stamp for the South Sound gathering that may fit into a <br/>
large series I am working on with a lake theme.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, its good to see that you made it back safely and that the <br/>
sniper didnt stop you from getting some 'boxing in.<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail and at the meet and greet.<br/>

&gt; I just returned from a week long trip to the East Coast (I live in <br/>
&gt; the greater Seattle area) and spent a lot of the time within the <br/>
&gt; current sniper-affected areas.  It did cause me to think twice <br/>
about <br/>
&gt; venturing out for some LBs but I decided I wasn't going to <br/>
&gt; let 'them' run my life; that in itself is a form of terrorism!  <br/>
&gt; Several times yesterday and the day before that, I traveled past <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; school where the young boy was shot last week in Bowie and it <br/>
caused <br/>
&gt; me to reflect on the situation, say a prayer for him, his family <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; the other victims and their families, but I continued to the park <br/>
&gt; where I was planning on looking for some boxes.  There are <br/>
four <br/>
&gt; letterboxes about 1 mile from that particular school.  Yes, we <br/>
were <br/>
&gt; extremely concerned about the situation but life must <br/>
continue...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See you on the letterboxing trail...<br/>

&gt; Finally bagged some East Coast boxes (10 but no HHs)!!!  <br/>
Was even <br/>
&gt; first finder for one that was placed many moons ago!!!  ;)  <br/>
Solved <br/>
&gt; many mystery boxes in the process but ran out of time in the <br/>
&gt; area...  :(  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So many boxes, so little time!!!<br/>
