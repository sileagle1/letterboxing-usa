rock.....many opinions have surrounded this discovery.  An early <br/>
species of bird?  A tyrodacatal?  What can it be?  Inside information <br/>
has it that this fossil proves Dragons once roamed the earth.  This <br/>
information has been kept secret.  However, a replica of the fossil <br/>
has secretly been made and placed in the very area in which the <br/>
original was found in the hopes this information will be made <br/>
public!  If there is proof that Dragons were once real....this could <br/>
be it.  Decide for yourself.  Stamp----"Dragon In The Rock"--and help <br/>
uncover this secret....<br/>

 Smuggled Document #223.2     <br/>
     "Draco-Inviolatus: Evidence points to this branch of the family <br/>
being ground dwellers, walking on all fours, and spending little time <br/>
in the air. The 'inviolatus' specimens have been mainly found in the <br/>
sub-terainian levels, in family groups with sizes ranging from 10cm <br/>
long to almost 3 metres in length. As with all dragonkind the caves <br/>
where they lived were found to be heavily laiden with gold."  <br/>
