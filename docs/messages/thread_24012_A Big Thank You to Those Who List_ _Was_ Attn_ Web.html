Why  should Phyto be limited to what boxes she is allowed<br/>
to find just because  she is offering more than the average box and<br/>
straight-forward clue? Do you  really think, or want, that the most<br/>
clever and imaginative box creators  would limit themselves to what the<br/>
two main clue sites have to offer in the  way of clue placement or<br/>
composition?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am a newbie, and have no opinion on this topic yet. But I do have a  <br/>
question that I have been wondering about &amp; can't find the answer to on any  of the <br/>
sites I've been going to. How *do* you find out about boxes that are not  <br/>
listed somewhere on a website? I imagine word-of-mouth and clues in other boxes  <br/>
would be one way, but are there others?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
