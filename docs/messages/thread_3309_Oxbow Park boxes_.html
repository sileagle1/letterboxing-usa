*rolling eyes*  If you had REALLY found Oxbow #1, you'd know that I <br/>
have yet to look for those two boxes since I've never stamped into <br/>
them.  Now I'm beginning to wonder about that F-count of <br/>
yours....  ;o)<br/>

We keep talking like it, but haven't done it yet.  Maybe someday!<br/>
