<br/>
An update on RayvenMom:  The doctors sent her home late yesterday evening, in their words, because she was healing well and could do better at home, I think it was because she was raising hell with them about having just about ENOUGH Beef Broth for an army, thank you very much!!!  Needless to say, whatever the reason, she is home, safe and sound and on the mend!<br/>
<br/>
Now, as far as Fright Fest '03, NO, it will not be delayed. Matter of fact, getting out that day will be good for her anyways, so, Yes, we're still on and the specifics are available at the website mentioned below.<br/>
<br/>
ScoutDogs, thank you, your stamp as arrived and it is TRULY beautiful! I only hope to carve as well one day!<br/>
<br/>
Fright Fest '03 is shaping up to be a frightfully wonderful time!<br/>
