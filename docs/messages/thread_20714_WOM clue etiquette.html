Just curious here.  Once you receive WOM clues...are these to be <br/>
passed on if ever requested by anyone...or are these only to be <br/>
passed by the placer?  Thanks!  BugZ<br/>

I wouldn't pass on anyone else's WOM clues unless given permission <br/>
to. If someone saw a WOM stamp in my journal and asked where I got <br/>
it, I would give them the contact info for the box in question.<br/>
<br/>
I'm new at this though so I don't really know what is "standard". <br/>
That's just what I'd do.<br/>

I know of some boxes that are fun to find but not on the site.  What <br/>
I did was contact the placer myself and ask them how they felt about <br/>
me sharing clues with others.  We came to the agreement that if I <br/>
felt confident that they were reputable/responsible boxers, I could <br/>
pass the info on.  It has helped me.  I have shared the information <br/>
with several people, and there are some that I didn't know as well <br/>
and held back until I knew them a little better.  It has worked out <br/>
pretty well so far, but I'm glad that I know I am not giving out <br/>
something the planter would not wish for me to share.<br/>
