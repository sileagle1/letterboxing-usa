                    <div class="plaintext-content">Am I the only one who has trouble writing clues? As I leave the <br/>
plant location, I think I'm doing great. As I type up the clues, I <br/>
worry about being too confusing or not challenging enough. <br/>
When I read the clues a week after they are posted, they sound <br/>
extremely lame.<br/>
<br/>
We have two planted boxes that have not been posted yet <br/>
because of my frustration. (You'd think it would be easy for me <br/>
because I'm an editor.)<br/>
<br/>
I think part of my problem is I get frustrated when other people's <br/>
clues don't make sense. I hate going through all of the clues  <br/>
thinking we are solving the puzzle only to realize we're in the <br/>
wrong spot and we don't know where we went wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

Have a friend or local letterboxer be a "beta tester" for you and <br/>
give you feedback.  I do it all the time.<br/>

<br/>
CSCM and I do that for each other and we have done it for other boxers as <br/>
well. Then you can get feedback about what they found confusing or what could be <br/>
decribed differently etc.<br/>
<br/>
happy boxing<br/>
