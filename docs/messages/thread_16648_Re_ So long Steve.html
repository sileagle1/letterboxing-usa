lurking like the rest of us, the huddled masses. It's not like he is <br/>
going on a long challenging trip...like hiking the Appalachian Trail <br/>
for instance ;-) <br/>
  Steve made a personal decision to take a break. Let's keep it <br/>
personal, drop the issue, and get back to l.b.ing.  As the infamous <br/>
Swartzenagger (wow, butchered that spelling didn't I?)  He'll Be <br/>
Baaack!" when he is ready.<br/>
  On to the topic of letterboxing!!  I'm eagerly gathering Cape Cod <br/>
clues for our upcoming long weekend away Nov. 7th.  Thanks so much <br/>
for the suggestions which have been offered. Now the Haunted <br/>
Letterbox Series planted here in CT by the Maplines..that has been a <br/>
real challenge for me.  I cannot find number 1 of the series..wanted <br/>
to find them all and find them in order.  To add that special element <br/>
of high drama, the series gets pulled on Oct. 31.TICK-TICK-TICK-time <br/>
is running out! Do you think they might give me one more day to find <br/>
the boxes if I whine loud enough?? <br/>
