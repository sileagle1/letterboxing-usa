&gt; Hi Jena!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I am the owner of the two letterboxes in Estabrook Woods, and I plan<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; keep the ownership of them - Henry's Sawmill Site and the Limestone<br/>
Quarry.<br/>
&gt; I do check on them periodically, so I would not appreciate your taking<br/>
over<br/>
&gt; their ownership!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     You probably are going to tread on people's toes by suggesting this.<br/>
&gt; Why did you suggest this anyway?  Why don't you carve your own stamps?<br/>

undelivered, I did not hear back from this individual.  Finally after <br/>
almost 6 months, I went and picked up the box and made a post here <br/>
that I had done so and that I would be carving up a new stamp for the <br/>

the box was so close to my house.  I got the feeling my efforts were <br/>
not necessarily appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
So when I offered to take the responsibility for some of the <br/>
unclaimed/abandoned boxes in Michigan, I was very careful to state in <br/>
my messages to the original owners that I was just doing so as an <br/>
interim measure to keep the clues from being deleted from the web <br/>
site, and that hopefully I would be able to make contact with them <br/>
and they would still be interested in maintaining their box, at which <br/>
time, I would step back, unless they were not interested in <br/>
letterboxing any longer, in which case I would be willing to maintain <br/>
the box indefinately.  Of the 5 people I contacted, I have heard back <br/>
from 4, all of whom just were not aware of the new site/need to claim <br/>
their boxes.  They were all very pleasant and I didn't feel like I <br/>
had stepped on their toes.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't you know it, the one person that I have not heard back from <br/>

Unforunately, no matter how good your intentions are and how <br/>
tactfully you communicate this, there are always going to be folks <br/>
who get defensive and do not appreciate your efforts.  Don't sweat <br/>
it...  it's not you.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Truthfully, I think some folks are offended at everything. There is no<br/>
reason that either of these people should feel threatened or be so rude,<br/>
especially as was the lady replying to Jena's kind offer. If she was really<br/>
diligent with the care and responsibility, why would she have not checked<br/>
the WEB SITE periodically to make sure her clues were still viable and still<br/>
listed? You can also bet that IF she did log on to the web site and found<br/>
that her clues were dropped and or her boxes listed as abandoned, she would<br/>
be the first to write a flaming letter to the web masters demanding to know<br/>
why. No matter what you do, you just can't please some folks! But, that<br/>
doesn't mean that your efforts were not appreciated by others.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, my suggestion for contacting the owners of such boxes would<br/>
include a note about why this caretaker role has come about and specifically<br/>
make mention of the changes to the web site. I'm sure many individuals don't<br/>
check in on the web site very often and hence, are not aware of such<br/>
updates. Perhaps the web master could put a note on the opening page that<br/>
changes have been made to the web site and boxes placed should be checked to<br/>
make sure that they are not listed as abandoned. I think the key in<br/>
contacting owners is wording of the letter, mainly because again some people<br/>
get easily offended. In the notes I wrote, I stated that I was offering my<br/>
assistance to the box owner in the event that they were no longer able to<br/>
care for their box. Further, I stated that if they did intend on maintaining<br/>
their box that they needed to visit the web site and update their box, as<br/>
that it was currently listed as abandoned because of the web site<br/>
modifications, and that the box would be removed if it was not updated or<br/>
assigned a caretaker.<br/>
<br/>
 Something else to consider is placing a timeline on leaving boxes<br/>
considered abandoned up as active on the web site, say 6 months. If the<br/>
owner has not contacted the web master or the list in that amount of time,<br/>
then the box is adopted or removed. I think this gives some backing to those<br/>
folks willing to adopt orphan boxes and puts a huge glitch in people<br/>
insinuating that caretakers are just out grab ownership of their box. Six<br/>
months seems a very reasonable amount of time for an owner to get in contact<br/>
and if they don't they really don't have a complaint.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
Sheila ( Puppylover)<br/>
<br/>
PS.. Jena, I think I would have written a reply to this woman mentioning<br/>
that your offer was to prevent some really nice letterboxes from being<br/>
removed from the web site because of their listing as being abandoned. And,<br/>
that if she wants to prevent them from being dropped, she needs to visit the<br/>
website and update her information.<br/>
