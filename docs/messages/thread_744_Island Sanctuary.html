                    <div class="plaintext-content">Happy Thanksgiving to all! Hope to get out later and "box off" some of<br/>
the added tonage. We've placed another shorty, which will probably<br/>
complete our Conanicut Island Series, and revisited several of the<br/>
boxes there, all with Tom's marvelous stamp now prominent in the books.<br/>
And, with no modesty, I've got to say that in the fall season fog, the<br/>
spots are really nice!<br/>
<br/>
Island Sanctuary<br/>
<br/>
A single letterbox with views of the marshes over an easy   mile. Just<br/>
north of the Newport Bridge tollbooths, take the Jamestown exit of Rte.<br/>
138 and drive a short way to park at the Jamestown Country Club on your<br/>
right. Walk back northwards along the road about 100 yards to the<br/>
Conanicut Island Sanctuary, and turn left (west) on the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the trail between the golf course and a stone wall to a "T"<br/>
intersection and turn right, east, for a counterclockwise loop. Meander<br/>
through shrubby woods that are reclaiming an old farm, and branch right<br/>
to take in the views at an observation platform. Then continue to the<br/>
next rightward branch, which leads to an overlook without a platform.<br/>
The Island Sanctuary Letterbox is hidden behind a large old maple tree<br/>
on the left (south) just as you turn in on the side trail. After<br/>
stamping in, continue a short way back to your "T" and turn right for<br/>
home.<br/>
