I didn't think it was a problem telling about the fallen tree beng that it's<br/>
no longer an acurate description.  You may have to rehide it and notify the<br/>
caretaker.  Besides, the real challenge is finding the sight via Margaret,<br/>
Mary and Barbara.  Chances are none of the 3 met each other.  Although 2<br/>
could have.  One is only meetable on a wing and a prayer.  I don't think any<br/>
of these clues will help you, but they will make sense when you solve the<br/>
riddle.<br/>
