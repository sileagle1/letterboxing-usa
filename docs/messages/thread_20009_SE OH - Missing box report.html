                    <div class="plaintext-content">FYI - the much overlooked Ridgewood Flower letterbox in Wellston has<br/>
been lost and will not be replaced.  Clues have been pulled from the<br/>
main site.  We went to check on it and found the entire top tier of<br/>
the old stone wall had been removed by maintenance workers who<br/>
apparently removed the box as well.  Our boxes just don't seem to do<br/>
well in cemeteries.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I had a report that the Little Boar box down in Lawerence Co. is<br/>
missing as well but haven't had time to go check it yet.  Hope you all<br/>
are doing better than we are.  Happy boxing!<br/>
