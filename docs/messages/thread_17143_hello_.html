                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi. We're fairly new to letterboxing, but have had a<br/>
great summer in New England turning over rocks. It's<br/>
also neat seeing a few familiar names on this list.<br/>
<br/>
In the summer, Tak was a little wary of the<br/>
mosquitoes, and it seems that this time of year is<br/>
almost nicer for letterboxing than the summer. We've<br/>
been averaging about one a weekend as of late. Last<br/>
weekend had to be one of the nicer letterboxes we've<br/>
found. The day couldn't have been more beautiful. I<br/>
took a few pictures:<br/>

<br/>
Still contemplating where to put our own letterbox. I<br/>
know so many precious places deep in the woods of<br/>
northeastern CT. But we want to get a good feel for it<br/>
before we do.<br/>
<br/>
But that's it for now, I guess. I just wanted to drop<br/>
a quick hello and thank you to everyone who takes part<br/>
in letterboxing. It's been quite a wonderful addition<br/>
to our lives.<br/>
