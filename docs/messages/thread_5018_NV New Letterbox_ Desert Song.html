<br/>
The Desert Song Letter Box can be found in a state park about an <br/>
hour's drive north-east of  "The Meadow."  Drive to the north-east <br/>
from that meadow on the interstate highway. After about 30 miles take <br/>
the exit to the right on a highway whose digits sum to 16. Head east <br/>
along that highway for 15 miles to the park entrance where you will be <br/>
required to pay a modest entrance fee. The sites of the park are well <br/>
worth the cost. Pick up a park brochure there. Continue onward for <br/>
another 3 miles marveling at the wonders on either side of the road. <br/>
You'll pass an area of bee hives where you won't find honey and trees <br/>
that won't burn. Take a left turn toward the visitors' center, but <br/>
don't go there. Rather proceed uphill through extra-terrestrial <br/>
looking terrain. You'll pass the turn-out for the water tank of a <br/>
rodent and continue onward until you arrive at the end of the road. <br/>
Park in the lot there, then read and heed the signs and advisories <br/>
near the public conveniences.<br/>
<br/>
Your quest continues on foot along the marked hiking trail.<br/>
<br/>
The trail should be no trouble for experienced hikers, but it is more <br/>
difficult than a walk in a city park. There are boulders to climb over <br/>
and gullies to walk up. There will be tricky footing in places. Make <br/>
sure that you are prepared for a two hour round trip hike in the <br/>
desert. The desert temperatures can be higher than 100 degrees F in <br/>
the summer. Make sure to take sufficient water and to use sun block. <br/>
Take precautions against the heat. Read and heed the warnings and <br/>
advisories on the park brochures and the trail head signs. The desert <br/>
environment is fragile. Please take care not to disturb vegetation. <br/>
Watch out for the animal inhabitants. Some of them can be <br/>
disagreeable. Take a compass and know how to use it. Exercise proper <br/>
precautions to avoid getting lost.<br/>
<br/>
Continue your search on the marked 1.2 mile hiking loop that leaves <br/>
the parking lot. You'll start out traveling down a gully and then past <br/>
a structure erected as a prop for the 1965 movie "The Professionals." <br/>
The area has been used in the filming of many movie scenes. See if you <br/>
recognize parts of it from any of your favorite movies (not "Gone with <br/>
the Wind" though). Continue on the hiking trail to a narrow corridor <br/>
between two high rock faces. Follow the trail through the corridor <br/>
enjoying the cool relief from the dessert heat.<br/>
<br/>
Upon exiting the corridor the hiking path turns to the right, but <br/>
don't follow it. Rather leave the hiking path and proceed due west <br/>
along a drainage gully also known as a wash. The wash will take you to <br/>
another corridor between two rock faces about six feet high. At the <br/>
exit of that corridor turn left heading due south and continue <br/>
following the wash keeping near the rock face on your left.<br/>
<br/>
 After a short distance, the main drainage path will turn to the <br/>
right; don't follow it. Continue in a southerly direction parallel <br/>
with the rock face on your left. While following that left hand rock <br/>
face, you'll soon be able to observe your next landmark. That will be <br/>
a very large rock shaped like the head of an eagle with beak pointing <br/>
to the left and perched on a very high peak ahead at a bearing of 165 <br/>
degrees. Continue toward that noble bird.<br/>
<br/>
When you get near the base of the eagle's lookout the wash will pass <br/>
to its left. Stay in that wash still keeping the same rock face on <br/>
your left and now the eagle's head on your right. You'll be traveling <br/>
up a gully on a bearing of 130 degrees. The footing becomes more <br/>
difficult in this area, so be extra careful.<br/>
<br/>
The gully will take you to a drop-off looking down upon a large flat <br/>
sandy area. Stop on that overlook, your prize is near. Turn to your <br/>
left looking in a north-east direction. You'll see the end of the high <br/>
rock face that has been on your left and a low hill continuing forward <br/>
like a shoulder from the base of that wall. Climb onto that shoulder <br/>
being careful not to fall off, and proceed to the junction of the <br/>
shoulder and the sheer rock face above it. If you look around the end <br/>
of that face, you'll see the road that brought you to the parking lot; <br/>
but don't go in that direction. Your prize is already within you <br/>
grasp. <br/>
<br/>
Notice the overhang formed at the bottom of the high rock face. A very <br/>
short distance back from the end of the face you'll see a pile of <br/>
rocks that have fallen from that overhang. Your Desert Song is <br/>
crooning sweetly within. After stamping in, make sure to replace it <br/>
carefully protected and covered by those rocks so that other visitors <br/>
may also enjoy its sweet notes.<br/>
<br/>
With a careful eye on your compass reverse your course to return to <br/>
the hiking trail from which you deviated earlier. You can retrace your <br/>
steps all the way back to the parking lot or continue around the <br/>
remaining hiking loop to get there. The distances are roughly the same <br/>
in either direction.<br/>
<br/>
The park has some truly amazing works of nature and of man. If you <br/>
have the time you would be well advised to enjoy them while the notes <br/>
of your Desert Song still ring in your ears.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your visit. This letterbox will be checked very <br/>
infrequently. An email report on its condition would be very much <br/>
appreciated.<br/>
