We are leaving for a 3 week cruise through the Panama canal, from San Fran,<br/>
in 10 days.   We will be arriving in San Francisco on Sunday afternoon and<br/>
the ship departs on Tuesday afternoon.    I would LOVE to do some 'boxing<br/>
while we're out there.    Normally, I would not ask for suggestions,<br/>
however, I've got a few constraints:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
None of us (we're meeting my parents, and Aunt/Uncle out there) have ever<br/>
been to SF before.   There will be 7 of us (including my 16mos daughter)<br/>
sharing one rented van.   We're planning to site see the typical things<br/>
(Alcatraz, Redwoods, ride a cable car).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I pulled up the list of boxes in SF and there are quite a few!!  :-)   I<br/>
have no knowledge of the area, and may be limited in my ability to drive too<br/>
far away.  Long hikes (over an hour) will not fit b/c of the baby and our<br/>
limited overall time in SF.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would love to have some suggestions, if people don't find this request too<br/>
offensive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>

Assuming your cruise ship stops at Panama City for an afternoon, there<br/>
*are* some boxes in Panama City that can be nabbed. ;o)<br/>

My Off to See the Wizard box is a short walk if you park near the <br/>
Conservatory of Flowers.  Practically a drive-by.<br/>
<br/>
There is a box on a certain island off the cost of San Fran as well... peruse <br/>
those clues!<br/>
<br/>
The Ortus Depths one is also a short walk, if you figure it out first and <br/>
learn its location.  I think the walk only took us about 10 minutes.  <br/>
