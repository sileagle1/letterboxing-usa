<div>First off, there won't be a hint in the EMS store 
video, as we weren't able to make the video :)</div>
<div>Now, on to boxes.  We've found Say What, Paint 
Works and the Glendora Tavern box all ok.  Also, we've done our EMS staff 
boxes and they're there with no errors.  </div>
<div>I could not find the 70 million years ago 
box.  I had the spot, and a pile of rocks, but to no avail.  I have 
seen that others have had trouble finding it.  It is a bit of a popular 
place, as there were beer cans strewn about.</div>
<div>Now, on to Splashing in the Devil's tub.  I 
have a friend that found it last week.  I went today however, and the 
wildlife management area in that spot was on fire :-(   I obviously 
could not get it myself.  So you may want to check on it's safety 
soon.</div>
