Congratulations Wanda on reaching PFX 5000. Thats incredible. I cant even imagine ever hitting that. I also enjoyed hearing about your adventures. Wishing you continued success in letterboxing. Hoping to see you and Pete again soon. I was very glad to hear that you will be attending the Mansfield Monster Mash gathering October 2nd. Hope you look forward to doing some hiking and chasing down some monsters in Mansfield this October. The monsters are coming and we expect quite a few of them. Find them if you can ..Chuck and Molly<br/>
