<div><strong>Native Son #6, Lou Little</strong></div>
<div>Planted by David and Deanne Besnia in Leominster MA (Worcester 
County) in Barrett Park on 11/26/01</div>
<div>This one is easy.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Take West Street out of downtown Leominster and turn left onto 
Pond Street.  Follow Pond Street as it winds around to Pleasant Street. 
Take a right onto Pleasant Street and when you come to the fork in the road bear 
right which brings you onto Chestnut Street. Drive up Chestnut Street and look 
for the sign for Barrett Parkway, which is on the right.  Park in the lot 
and walk into Barrett Park.  Follow the trail to the right which brings you 
onto a sandy beach and past a tennis/skateboard/basketball court. Follow this 
trail around the pond keeping the woods on your right and the pond on your 
left.  You will pass several benches and trash receptacles. Halfway around 
the pond you will come to a causeway which you will pass over.  After you 
pass over the causeway the path turns to dirt again.  Look off to the right 
for a stone wall in the woods.  At approximately 10 paces from the 
beginning of the path look for some loose bark in front of the stone wall which 
shelters Native Son #6, Lou Little, who led the 1934 Columbia University Lions 
to the Rose Bowl where they defeated Stanford University 
7-0</div></body></html>
