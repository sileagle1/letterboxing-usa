<br/>
Difficulty: 3 (out of 5)<br/>
Terrain: 2 (a somewhat hilly cemetery)<br/>
<br/>
You'll find this hero resting in the Ohio county named in honor of <br/>
the United States' seventh president.  Our hero is one of a group who <br/>
were awarded the first ever Medals of Honor for their daring heroism <br/>
in service to the country.  He received his medal July 20, 1864  the <br/>
seventeenth Medal of Honor ever awarded.  Our hero's adventure began <br/>
in Big Shanty, Georgia almost exactly a year after the Civil War <br/>
began.  Because the General didn't run fast enough, the mission <br/>
failed and our hero was captured for awhile.  He survived the war and <br/>
died in 1890 at 50 years of age.  You'll find him resting in the <br/>
county seat in lot 149 of the Old Block of a cemetery whose name is a <br/>
euphemism for "Beautiful Mountain".<br/>
In 1962, to commemorate the centennial of his heroism, a local group <br/>
gave him a new stone that features the slow General that got him <br/>
caught.  You must find this stone to find our commemorative <br/>
letterbox.  If you have sharp eyes, the stone is visible from a road <br/>
in the western side of the cemetery, nearer to the top of the ridge <br/>
than the bottom.  After paying homage to our hero and admiring his <br/>
newest stone, take a bearing of 266 and go about 43 paces (1 pace = <br/>
2 steps although due to the terrain and the need to be respectful of <br/>
the graves the count is approximate in this case) to a battered old <br/>
tree that's obviously missing a limb or two.  Look carefully around <br/>
the base of this tree and find our tribute stamp.  Have fun and email <br/>
us if you find it and let us know how it's doing at: <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">"Stars in His Eyes" mystery box. Placed 7-12-03 by Salamander. <br/>
Difficulty: Moderate; drive up. Clues: Once upon a time, there was a <br/>
little frog living happily in his southern Ohio hometown( which was <br/>
the state's first capital, by the way).The frog felt generally very <br/>
satisfied with his life except for one unfufilled ambition---he had <br/>
always wanted to act in a Broadway play in New York City.(His mother <br/>
always said he had stars in his eyes). So the frog saved his pennies <br/>
and was finally able to make the trip to New York. But he was unable <br/>
to secure an audition with any of the big productions. So he went to <br/>
see three plays instead, and found that he was quite happy even just <br/>
being in the audience.  Then the frog returned to his small hometown <br/>
and lived happily ever after, realizing how lucky he was to have a <br/>
great view of the city and at least one big star in his eyes, right <br/>
in his own back yard. He felt very attached to things there, and <br/>
decided that he would forever after guard his small town way of life, <br/>
never leaving his post again whether by air, sea or rail. The little <br/>
frog would welcome a visit from you, IF you can figure out where he <br/>
lives.    *** This box brought to you by the magic of Velcro (hint).<br/>
