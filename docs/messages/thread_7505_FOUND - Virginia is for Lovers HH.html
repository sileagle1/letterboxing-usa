having hung out with the Jolly G-Man's Blue Heron in Fredericksburg, <br/>
VA, for 5 long weeks.  It will be leaving the Commonwealth shortly as <br/>
it tags along to our vacation spot.  Watch for messages about this <br/>
hitchhiker's West Coast adventures!<br/>
<br/>
The log book for this Southern Belle is dressed beautifully in what <br/>
appears to be a handmade gown but she is a fragile little thing and <br/>
already needed a little help to keep her slip(s) from showing.  I <br/>
will attach a note warning the next finder to handle carefully.<br/>
