Hi Choi<br/>
When I cranked our Spam filter to high this last summer and were on <br/>
the road, about the only thing that got through was the "Contact the <br/>
Placer" notes. I might have punched in the LBNA address for favorites <br/>
as I can't figure out what the heck I did. Is there anyway to set up <br/>
an automatic message that we can click on that will send out a <br/>
reply "Can't answer now, on vacation" ?<br/>

The times I've contacted the placers, I've gotten replies back maybe 5% of<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, maybe I should say that it doesn't seem to be that important to *most*<br/>
placers in *my* experience.  For the boxes that I've either placed myself or<br/>
adopted, I'll quite often see stamps in the logbooks from placers that have<br/>
stated at one time or another that they appreciate being contacted when<br/>
somebody finds one of *their* boxes.  However, those same placers often<br/>
haven't contacted me when they've found the boxes of mine whose logbooks<br/>
they've stamped into.  Seems to be a double standard afoot.  If a placer<br/>
hasn't contacted me if they've found a box of mine, do they have a right to<br/>
expect that I'll contact them when we find one of *their* boxes?  Do they<br/>
even have a right to *hope* a finder would contact them?  I feel little<br/>
obligation to do much contacting anymore.<br/>
<br/>
And that's why I don't bother giving "reports" on the local list anymore<br/>
either after we've gone out and found a bunch of boxes for the day.  Folks<br/>
will email me and say they were glad to hear about their box when I used to<br/>
post.  However, I there very few "reports" from those same people after<br/>
*they've* been out finding boxes.  So I just simply don't bother anymore.<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; I'm looking for an answer to what happens to one's messages <br/>
&gt; that are sent through LBNA.  This would be the message from   <br/>
&gt; the clue page where it says "Contact the Placer."  I have sent <br/>
&gt; a few messages this way but never heard <br/>
&gt; back from the Placer.  I have sent myself a message and <br/>
&gt; never received it.  How does this work?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Thanks for any advice.<br/>
