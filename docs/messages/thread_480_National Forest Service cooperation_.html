<br/>
I'm a new subscriber to this list. I apologize if this subject has been addressed; I've gone to the archives, done a search, and found nothing, but realize I may not have looked for the right keywords. <br/>
<br/>
What I wonder is whether anyone who's actively placing letterboxes has had any run-ins, positive or negative, with the National Forest Service. The area where I aim to place my boxes is under NFS control. It seems like the right thing to do to get their permission before planting the boxes, but I foresee red tape (e.g., at one extreme, being required to submit an environmental impact statement for bureau and public review). I've got a month or so before the snowpack melts, so I have time to consider alternative approaches. What has worked? What hasn't?<br/>

with the Forestry Commission to ensure that what we do and the way we do it<br/>
is environmentally friendly and acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed we have to refrain from letterboxing during the months of June and<br/>
October.<br/>
Furthermore there are certain defined areas where we can venture but not<br/>
have a box located.<br/>

I had wondered how long it would be before a subject such as this might come<br/>

Trying to negotiate with a whole host of bodies could be fraught with<br/>
difficulty/delay. However you have certain inalienable rights which would<br/>
also fall to be considered.<br/>

Good Luck!<br/>

I have a call into a couple of relatives who work for the NFS and the<br/>
State Department of Natural Resources with that very question.  I'll let<br/>
you know what they have to say.  My guess is that they'll say fine as<br/>
long as the ground is not disturbed and the boxes are not situated in<br/>
some endangered species habitat.  I'd bet they would balk at actual<br/>
"planting" of the boxes underground where shovels or the like would be<br/>
required, and would likewise have problems if any damage was done to<br/>
surrounding vegitation.  Course this is all conjecture, so i'll quit<br/>
speculating and let you know what i find out.   Its great to hear from<br/>
someone in Montana!            Jim Price<br/>

Mark,<br/>
I also wish to welcome you to our growing clan of Northwest letterboxers.  <br/>
Your concerns are worth discussing.  A similar message was posed recently on <br/>
the California Contacts list (of which I am a member, despite the fact that I <br/>
live in Oregon).<br/>
<br/>
I have placed several boxes on NFS lands.  I agree with Thom that placing <br/>
your boxes responsibly is the key to avoiding problems with government <br/>
officials, whether national or local.<br/>
<br/>
I also include my email address (and phone number) in my boxes.  If there is <br/>
a problem with my boxes, I want to be the first to know.  I also include <br/>
several copies of an info sheet that explains the whole letterboxing concept, <br/>
so that an accidental finder will at least understand what's going on.  (This <br/>
info sheet can be found in the "Getting Started" section of the website.)  <br/>
Fearing that by asking permission, I would be giving someone the opportunity <br/>
to say "NO", I must confess that I have placed my boxes without asking anyone <br/>
if it is okay.<br/>
<br/>
My attitude is that before any officials can get upset about my boxes, they <br/>
will have to FIND them first!!!  (They had better bring their compasses!!)  <br/>
My boxes are well hidden, and can be accessed without having any impact on <br/>
native wildlife or vegetation.  They are near established trails and do not <br/>
require you to trample any grass, moss, ferns, etc. to reach them.  They are <br/>
under rocks and logs, or in natural cracks and fissures, so there is no need <br/>
to bring a shovel.<br/>
<br/>
As long as we all take every precaution to practice responsible letterboxing, <br/>
I do not anticipate problems with the authorities.  If you manage to get some <br/>
official word on the subject, however, I would be interested in hearing it.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mitch (a.k.a. "Der Mad Stamper")<br/>

Thanks, Mitch, this looks like really good info (i.e., precedent and promises) to take with me when I go talk to the district forest supervisor.<br/>

<br/>
I ask Mitch and all of you kindly to accept that we may need<br/>
permission in some cases to do what we are doing.  If we're<br/>
advertising boxes in parks we all know they're there.  If<br/>
public officials think we are some kind of renegades and do<br/>
not respect their authority they may pull the plug on what<br/>
we are doing.  My tack was to contact them to get permission.<br/>
In the parks I used they did not write back to me but I think<br/>
its cool with them.  Its good to ask.  But in the very least<br/>
lets not make statements claiming that we do not need to ask<br/>
at all.  <br/>
<br/>
I'd also like to thank whoever it is who borught this issue<br/>
up again.  We talked about it in the beginning and it was<br/>
never really fleshed out.  I don't think it would be a bad<br/>
idea to talk about it again.  Charles Merchant-White's<br/>
comments I thought were apropos: "Furthermore there are<br/>
certain defined areas where we can venture but not have a<br/>
box located. Failure could mean the banning of this pursuit<br/>
in any area controlled by them."<br/>
<br/>
We are operating in many case under the auspice of the state<br/>
and national parks.  Let's have the utmost respect for that.<br/>
That's the attitude we will need if we want to keep the hobby<br/>
going.<br/>
<br/>
