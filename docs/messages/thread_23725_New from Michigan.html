<br/>
Welcome to letterboxing to you and your daughter!  What part of Michigan are you from?<br/>
<br/>
In answer to your question about the store-bought versus hand-carved stamp.  It is acceptable to put store-bought stamps into letterboxes, however most letterboxers prefer looking for hand-carved stamps.  This is not to say that nobody will look for the box, just that it is the preference.<br/>
<br/>
A first finders prize is something you leave in the box for the person who gets there first.  This is completely optional and not expected, but always a nice surprise.  This can be anything your heart desires -- a hand-stamped or computer-generated certificate, a trinket or hand-made item, a gift certificate/card to a local establishment (i.e. coffee house, craft store), money, a WOM clue to another letterbox -- there is no wrong or right, although it is a bad idea to leave food as this attracts animals.  Also items that would be inappropraite for children (i.e. lighters, adult material, etc.) are not acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, feel free to join us over at the Letterbox Great Lakes Yahoo! Group -- a regional list made up primarily of letterboxers in the western GL states (MI, OH, IN, IL, WI, MN).  It is a good place to keep in touch with what is happening in letterboxing on a regional level and meet other letterboxers in your area.<br/>

  Decided I should spend the time making a homemade stamp, so I bought a box of erasers and a few logbooks.  I'm going to try my hand at carving tonight.  <br/>
<br/>
  I joined the Great Lakes list too.  Thanks for letting me know about it.  <br/>
<br/>
  Spring Chick:  I took the clues to two of your letterboxes with me when me and my friends met last week and we had a blast trying to figure them out!  I am going to the Sugar Shack as soon as I can find it!!  I really loved your clues!  The only down side is that now the pressures is on to make challaging clues like yours.  <br/>
