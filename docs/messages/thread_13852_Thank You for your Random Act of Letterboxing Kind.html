This special box is to give thanks to those kind and generous letterboxing<br/>
souls who commit random acts of letterboxing kindness. This is a box that<br/>
searches for you. If it finds you, your job is to find someone who has<br/>
committed a RALK and pass it along. Please write a note in the logbook<br/>
singing their praises, stamp in, and add one to your 'F' count. <br/>
<br/>
To all recipients - a big thank you from Team Psychokiwi for your kind<br/>
deeds. We have got more out of this hobby than we could ever give back,<br/>
thanks to folk like you.<br/>
