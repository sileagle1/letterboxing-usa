&gt; The first-ever letterbox was planted in Ketchikan, Alaska on<br/>
&gt; September <br/>
&gt; 13, 2002, at Totem Bight State Park. (Unfortunately, the county <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; Ketchikan is in is not known.) It was planted by M. Gainey.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This box does not contain a pencil.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Because this box is an orphan, after you stamp in, could you please <br/>
&gt; drop me a note about the box's condition at mlgainey@y...? <br/>
&gt; Thanks, and happy boxing!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Go to Totem Bight State Park.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the car parking lot, take the trail to the clan house and the <br/>
&gt; totems.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Take the left fork.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Before you reach the clan house, you will see a trash can, a bench, <br/>
&gt; and an informational marker titled "clan house." Go off-trail into<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; woods at this point.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Walk toward a massive uprooted tree.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The box is hidden in a hole in the tree. The hole is on the end <br/>
&gt; closest to the clan house. The box is covered with bark in the <br/>
hole. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once you have stamped in, please rehide it in the hole and recover <br/>
&gt; with bark.<br/>
