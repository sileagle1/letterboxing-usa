<br/>
Location: Mt. Pollux Conservation Area, Amherst, MA<br/>
<br/>
Date placed: 12/31/01 by The L Troop<br/>
<br/>
Time: 10 minutes (from parking lot)<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Easy  good for children<br/>
<br/>
Directions to starting location:<br/>
<br/>
 From Downtown Amherst, proceed south on MA 116. About 1/4 mile past <br/>
the traffic light at the Fort River bridge, take a left onto Shays <br/>
St. Proceed through first Stop sign, and bear right onto South East <br/>
St (in front of a church). The entrance to the conservation area is 1 <br/>
mile on the right, between two houses.<br/>
This point can also be reached from the intersection of Bay Rd and <br/>
South East St,  1 mile north on the left.<br/>
<br/>
 A short,uphill  gravel road will lead you to a small parking lot <br/>
(which evidently is closed off-season, but there is room for one <br/>
vehicle adjacent to the gate). <br/>
<br/>
A short hunt indeed, but one should plan to stay for a picnic to <br/>
enjoy the gorgeous, 360 degree views of Amherst and surrounding <br/>
towns. I've seen Eastern Bluebirds here, probably because of all the <br/>
apple trees.<br/>
<br/>
Clue: From the parking lot, hike to the summit. From the southern <br/>
side of the southernmost tree,  take a compass bearing of 221 degrees <br/>
and walk 50 paces (1 pace = 1 step). The Mt. Pollux letterbox is  <br/>
hidden near where you are standing. <br/>

   In the directions to the starting location below, it should be <br/>
noted that there is a *street* named Mt. Pollux when approaching <br/>
the conservation area from Amherst. It is on the right, about 1/2<br/>
mile before the correct turnoff. There is a small sign that<br/>
states "Mt. Pollux Conservation Area" at the correct junction.<br/>
