Sounds wonderful, Carolyn! What do you have in mind? We've been <br/>
kicking the idea for a fall get together around, but nobody <br/>
(including me!) has taken the initiative. I think it would be <br/>
wonderful to get together and meet folks and enjoy some late-autumn <br/>
hiking and letterboxing. The last two Gatherings were terrific: one <br/>
at a B&amp;B/Inn in Vermont and one camping in coastal CT. They are a <br/>
great chance to swap stories and exchange stamps, too! You meet the <br/>
nicest people letterboxing...<br/>
