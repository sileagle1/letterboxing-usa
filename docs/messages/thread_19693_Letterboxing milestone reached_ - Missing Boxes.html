listed in the LBNA site that are missing, despite numerous reports of <br/>
these boxes being gone.  We can name at least 3 (out of maybe 15) in <br/>
the greater Lehigh Valley, PA area that are gone - Lock Ridge, Just <br/>
Flying Through and Gold Fish.  Several people have verified this, yet <br/>
these are still listed on the LBNA site...<br/>
<br/>
So, our legends may actually be pushed beyond 50%, though SE CT would <br/>
probably push that %age down again.<br/>

&gt; Well, in theory you are corrent about 50%. In practice that number <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; off.  Keep in mind that the letterboxing.org site has no way to <br/>
tally <br/>
&gt; all the unpublished (aka word of mouth, etc) boxes in existence.    <br/>
&gt; Give 2 or 3 experienced boxers about 5 minutes to look at their <br/>
logs <br/>
&gt; and I'd  bet the list of local south eastern Connecticut <br/>
unpublished <br/>
&gt; boxes likely flirts with 100. Thats just ones that we know of!  Add <br/>
&gt; in the ledgerdemaine lore and the idea of bonus boxes and your <br/>
10,000 <br/>
&gt; creeps up fast.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hoever, even if  its 48% or 50% though, Wanda's accomplishments are <br/>
&gt; indeed noteworthy and significant; for that we definately give her <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; pat on the back!  [ and maybe some new hiking boots! ] <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -Steve, Heidi and Madras <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So, in other words, Wanda has handled more than 50% of all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxes in existence!  I'm not sure which statistic is more<br/>
&gt; &gt; impressive, the 5K or the 10K! <br/>
