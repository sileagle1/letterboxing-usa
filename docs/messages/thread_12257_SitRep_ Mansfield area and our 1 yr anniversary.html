                    <div class="plaintext-content">We spent a wonderful day hunting boxes in Mansfield with Bookworm, <br/>
RTRW, and her niece Alana.  We found so many great boxes.  We did the <br/>
3 Wizards series in Merrow Park, all in good shape, as well as the <br/>
Merrow Park box.  We picked up the Horse of a Different Color HH at <br/>
the Wizard #1 box and after stamping sent it home with RTRW and <br/>
Bookworm.  We also passed along Spare Tire to them.  Then we headed <br/>
to Mansfield Depot and picked up the Thompson Feed Store, Train <br/>
Tressle, Great Grapes, and Rub a Dub Dub.  And at Train Tressle we <br/>
found another HH- Fingers Crossed.  That one came home with us. Then <br/>
out to Eagleville Preserve, where we found Eagleville Dam and <br/>
Eagleville Preserve all in good shape.  Now for the bad news.  We <br/>
went to find Sit and Relax, and found the box sitting out in the <br/>
open, with only the ziploc bag and a few postcards left.  No sign of <br/>
the logbook or stamp :-(  But we managed to find a few more boxes.  <br/>
We went to Owen's Mere and picked up Queen of Hearts, Cupid, and <br/>
Cupid's Parasite.  RTRW, Bookworm and Alana had to go home, but we <br/>
managed to find Music to My Ears and Winterfest, I think.  We were <br/>
actually following the clues for Chico y Frio Hermano and right were <br/>
the box should be, we found one, but it was labeled Winterfest.  Then <br/>
we followed the clues for Winterfest and came up empty-handed.  So <br/>
I'm not sure if the boxes got mixed up or we did!<br/>
And we realized halfway through today that it was our 1 year <br/>
anniversary of letterboxing.  What a great day!  Thank you to all the <br/>
planters who make this wonderful hobby possible.  And thank you to <br/>
RTRW, Bookworm, and Alana for spending a day tromping around the <br/>
woods with us.<br/>

<br/>
P.S. If anyone is headed out to either Owen's Mere or Mansfield <br/>
Depot, please be aware that we found a deer carcus at each sight.  It <br/>
was a little disconcerting for us, so if you have kids, just be aware.<br/>
