We can set the list up as only members can post, but still<br/>
remain unmoderated.  This may stop some of the spam.  I'll <br/>

I've tried to lurk/post a couple other eGroups lists that were <br/>
members only and have been quite frustrated with that whole thing. <br/>
Sure, it's easy to subscribe ("join"), but what if folks don't want <br/>
to? I'd prefer us not to be a "members only" group.<br/>

I agree completely, when we are trying to build our<br/>
hobby we have enough challenges to overcome, than by<br/>
making it semi elite...saying you need to be a member<br/>
to communicate....if you don't want the message just<br/>
check it and delete it before opening....<br/>

<br/>
I can only recall of actually receiving 3 spam messages thru the<br/>
letterbox mail.  I deleted them quickly &amp; moved on.  In fact, I'm pretty<br/>
sure I have read more e-mail with spam concerns than actual spam.<br/>
<br/>
...oops... I just added to that number.<br/>
<br/>
I also think restricting access is going to curb the interest of some<br/>
people who don't want to subscribe just to get a question answered.<br/>
