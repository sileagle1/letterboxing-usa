"The tao begets the one,<br/>
 The one begets the two<br/>
 The two beget the three and<br/>
 The three beget the ten thousand things.<br/>
 All things are backed by the shade,<br/>
 Faced by the light<br/>
   And harmonized by the immaterial breath"<br/>

<br/>
Background:  When I carved these two simple stamps, I never intended <br/>
them to be their own hike.  I had planned to add them to a box I <br/>
already had in Ninigret.  But there was no safe place to put them in <br/>
Ninigret. I have been carrying them around with me for four months <br/>
looking for a place to plant them.  I finally found the perfect <br/>
place.  I simple hike for two simple stamps.  I would not expect <br/>
anyone to make a special trip out to find these boxes.  However, if <br/>
you are in the area doing one of the more than 50 letterboxes nearby, <br/>
you may want to add these two to the beginning or the end of your <br/>
day.  NOTE: These boxes were at the MA Winter Gathering so you may <br/>
have already done them there.<br/>
<br/>
Driving Directions: The village of Perryville lies north of Rt 1 <br/>
between Matunuck and Charlestown.  Take Rt 1 to Moonstone Beach Rd <br/>
NORTH towards Perryville Center.  At the stop sign take a left.  Take <br/>
your next right onto Gravelly Hill Rd.  Go 1/10 mile to a bulletin <br/>
board on the left side of road.  Park here.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  The trail starts on the opposite (right) side of the road at <br/>
a green sign that says "South Kingstown Land Trust. Pedestrians <br/>
Welcome. Vehicles Prohibited."  From the sign the trail rises quickly <br/>
up a north-south running ridge.  From the top of the ridge you have a <br/>
sweeping ocean view of Trustom Pond, Moonstone Beach, and Block <br/>
Island in the distance.  When you drop down off the ridge look for a <br/>
red arrow trail marker.  From the arrow take 60 steps along the <br/>
trail.  The "Yin" letterbox will be tucked between two tall pine <br/>
trees at 60 degrees.  Follow the red arrows.  The trail is fairly <br/>
flat and passes through quite a bit of mountain laurel.  You will <br/>
soon come to a white diamond "South Kingstown Land Trust" sign high <br/>
on a tree on the right side of the trail.  At this point the trail <br/>
goes down into a valley then up onto another ridge.  From this ridge <br/>
you can see the Narragansett breakwater off in the distance.  As you <br/>
start to come down off the ridge look for a knee high granite post on <br/>
the right side of the trail next to red arrow trail marker #15.  From <br/>
the post spot a rotten log/stump in the woods at 265 degrees.  Look <br/>
for the "Yang" letterbox under this log.  Retrace your route back to <br/>
your car.  Note: the trail continues on but does not loop back to <br/>
Gravely Hill Rd.  <br/>
