We were out in western mass dropping my daughter off at camp, and went to<br/>
Amherst afterwards for some letterboxing. We found the Mount Pollux box,<br/>
After re-reading the instructions it was easy, but we crawled a lot first!<br/>
And we found the Tortoise and the surprise Hare in the park close by.<br/>
Wesley was delighted!<br/>
We've slacked off recently, so this was a good day.<br/>

Hi there!  My name is Bonnie and I am the hider of the This Little Pig<br/>
and Mount Sugarloaf boxes.  I am so happy to hear you had a good day<br/>
of letterboxing.  Yes, those trails on North Mount Sugarloaf are not<br/>
great, but the views are worth it!<br/>
<br/>
I, too, have found the Mount Pollux box, but that was back in March,<br/>
well before poison ivy would have been a problem.  That one, and some<br/>
other local boxes, was hidden by the "F Troop."  Other than that<br/>
family, and myself, I don't think there are a lot of us letterboxers<br/>
in western Mass.  My sister Betsey mostly hides boxes near Boston but<br/>
also has a couple out this way. So I hope you will join in and hide<br/>
some boxes, too.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you continue to have a fun time letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
