<p>I'm not even sure whether this box's name is exactly correct, but i wonder 
  whether it's still there.  The clues were very easy to follow, 
  since I was one of the group who created this lovely trail along the 
  Willimantic river.  howeve, the trail in the open areas is badly overgown 
  today with briars, raspberry bushes (ripe berries too) and grasses as high as 
  my shoulder .  i <strong>think </strong>i found the dead tree, but no 
  sign of a box, but maybe i was discouraged by the thorns!  Any help with 
  this?</p>

  will still be hiding!</p>
