at Pierce College, right across the street from the Western State <br/>
(mental) Hospital.<br/>
<br/>
Now it was a well known fact that you would not pick up any Hitch <br/>
Hikers from in front of the hospital.  Just not a smart thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
Well , yesterdays Quest Fest at Ft Steilacoom Park saw Hitch Hikers <br/>
running wild.<br/>
<br/>
Today I visited the venue to get the boxes I missed yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
I picked up three HH's and have decided to take sympathy upon them <br/>
and give them a ride to cities in Western Washington.<br/>
<br/>
Mountain Maples "Zephyr" and the 7 Nails "The Travaling (sic)Hitch <br/>
Hiker "E" were found at the Washington Territorial Insane Asylum LB.  <br/>
Down the way Fudricks "Psyco" HH was found with "Aunt Beth" Though <br/>
Aunt Beth was out in the cold at the foot of the stump while the HH <br/>
was inside the stump.  I suspect that some folks missed this <br/>
matching. Beth is back where it is warm and cozy.  All the HH's are <br/>
stamped into their appropriate boxes and are on the move.<br/>
<br/>
Not one to be left out of the fun.  I released the "Busy As A Bee" HH <br/>
( in honor of our own DVN2R SKR ) at her WA Territorial Insane Asylum <br/>
LB after removing the other interlopers.  "Busy" was last seen in the <br/>
hands of Amanda from Seattle ( Nancy Drew) HEADING OUT OF THE PARK.<br/>
<br/>
So watch out Western Washington the HH's are everywhere.  Amanda <br/>
might take the Bee just about anyplace she flys so perhaps....<br/>
