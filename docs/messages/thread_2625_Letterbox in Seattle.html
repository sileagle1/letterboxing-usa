                    <div class="plaintext-content">hello there!  I finally got off of my duff and planted my first letterbox.  <br/>
Here is the info:<br/>
<br/>
    Schmitz Park,  Seattle, Washington<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  From I-5 take the West Seattle Bridge to SW Admiral Way.  Follow <br/>
Admiral Way uphill, through the business district, and downhill to SW Stevens <br/>
(watch for the "rainbow" park sign on the left, just before Admiral Way <br/>
crosses a bridge over the ravine). Turn left at the sign and keep right, <br/>
following the road down to the parking area.  Park in the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:  easy<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  From the parking lot, start at the sign that says "Leash Pets and <br/>
Obey Scoop Laws".<br/>
Take the main path to the right past a rock commemorating the bicentennial <br/>
planting of fir trees.<br/>
You'll come to a fork in the path, take the right fork upwards.   Further <br/>
along the trail, there will be a small wooden bridge to your left.  Take the <br/>
bridge and at the second section of bridge, there will be on your left a tree <br/>
with fallen trees on either side of it.  You can step off the bridge onto one <br/>
of these fallen trees.  At the base of the standing tree, within the roots is <br/>
the letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
You can go back the way you came, or follow the trail back to the parking <br/>
lot.  There are many secondary trails that criss-cross this park.  Also, many <br/>
local schools use the park as an outdoor classroom.  Please be discreet.  I <br/>
hope to plant some more letterboxes in this park soon!<br/>
<br/>
This is an Old-growth Evergreen Forest in the heart of Seattle.  There are a <br/>
variety of birds, trees, ferns and shrubs in the park.<br/>
