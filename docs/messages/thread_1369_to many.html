screen went blank it was saving the email. Well one can't be sure so <br/>
I would send it again.  I bet I got cut off 50 times last night it is <br/>
so frustrating. They say we have a lot of mice chewing the phone <br/>
lines in the area but we also have 2 universities in the neighborhood <br/>
and I think usage is so high here. So sorry for jamming up the digest <br/>
with  repeats.  <br/>
   To  the webmaster when you add them to the Canada map they are <br/>
located on the tiny penninsula between New Brunswick and the main <br/>
portion of Nova Scotia it is a road less traveled but beautiful <br/>
country. The seacoast there is very rough and the water cold but the <br/>
scenery is outstanding. Thanks for your great work on the site I <br/>
check in every day. Carol<br/>
