Don't mean to step on any toes but the original place was somewhere across from the ball field but that seems to have all changed. We are planning a trip up there in July and will check into this. I know the feeling of not finding something when you look so hard to find it. This particular box should be a lot easier to find since it would be looked for, during a short break from shopping.

If you want to look for boxes while in Freeport - might I suggest peeking at AQ as there is a series in Leon Gorman Park that you could pick up while in town : )<br/>
