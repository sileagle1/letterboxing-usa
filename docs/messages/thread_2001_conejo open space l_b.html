  Hi Nuthatch<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the new So. Cal box.  We will add it to our to do list when it<br/>
dries out around here.  If you like waterfalls, there are several in the<br/>
area.  Try "Waterfalls of California" as a great guide.  Gwen<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] New box in So. California<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My husband planted this box last Saturday (watch for more from us in the<br/>
&gt; near future). Here are his instructions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Conejo Open Space Letterbox<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This letterbox is located near Thousand Oaks, off of the 101 freeway in<br/>
&gt; Ventura County.  Exit the 101 freeway at Hampshire Road and turn<br/>
&gt; south.  About 1/2 mile from the freeway turn right onto Triunfo Canyon<br/>
&gt; Road.  Drive another 1/2 mile and take the first right turn after Triunfo<br/>
&gt; Park.  Continue up and to the right until you reach a cul-de-sac.  The<br/>
&gt; number of the last house on the left is 981, on the right, 982.  Park your<br/>
car.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A trail exits the cul-de-sac heading northward at about 340 degrees.  At<br/>
&gt; the top of the first climb you will find that you are on a ridgeline.  A<br/>
&gt; trail to your left at 160 degrees leads up a hill; ignore this trail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Continue on. . . passing first a trail, then a fire road to your<br/>
&gt; right.  After a short distance and a couple of climbs, you should be able<br/>
&gt; to look to your right and see right up the 23 freeway where it joins the<br/>
&gt; 101 freeway.  About the time you first see the junction, it will be at<br/>
true<br/>
&gt; north, 0 degrees.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The trail passes over rocky outcroppings--or maybe very old concrete--and<br/>
&gt; starts to head downward.  At this time the 23-101 junction will be about 5<br/>
&gt; degrees; the junction will pass out of sight as you head downhill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A fairly steep, rough, rocky descent ensues.  When the trail levels off, a<br/>
&gt; smaller trail leads off to the right at 290 degrees; follow this trail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As you follow this smaller trail, look to the left toward the near hills<br/>
&gt; and you will see two electrical towers.  When the left tower is at 225<br/>
&gt; degrees, and the right tower at 240 degrees, leave the trail on a bearing<br/>
&gt; of 200 degrees toward a lone yucca bush about 36 steps away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  From the yucca proceed 4 steps at 160 degrees.  That for which you quest<br/>
&gt; is located beneath a small cairn of rocks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Notes:<br/>
&gt; 1.  All bearings given are from true north, that is, declination<br/>
&gt; applied.  The local declination is 14 degrees east.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2.  The hike should take about 2 hours round-trip at an easy pace.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3.  The technical intensity of the hike is moderate, includes a good deal<br/>
&gt; of rise and fall and the trail is quite rocky.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4.  Watch out for ticks and rattlesnakes.<br/>
