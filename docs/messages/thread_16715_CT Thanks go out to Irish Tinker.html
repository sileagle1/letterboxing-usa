than I expected.  When the trail looks like it splits in two, turn left and go <br/>
around the ledge to the right.  As you are going around, it is under the roots <br/>
of a tree (I believe) in the ledge.<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

&gt;Hi BookWorm.  the DEP box was there last week .  Sadie and Russ and I<br/>
found it.  We just kept driving on the same woods road after finding<br/>
the last box in The Journey to Imagination. We first tried to out<br/>
smart the clues but ended up going to the starting point and hiking<br/>
up.  It is a lovely forest and the clues are well written so you will<br/>
 not have any trouble. <br/>
