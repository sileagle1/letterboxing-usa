was going to hold off Spinglike conditions for at least another week. <br/>
We successfully located:<br/>
<br/>
Wallingford, HOPE - what a tremendous Stamp.  WOW.  My daughters <br/>
enjoyed walking the labyrinth while I stamped in.  (Through 7 &amp; 4 year <br/>
old eyes - 100% of the fun is in the hunt.)  Was well hidden, and we made<br/>
a point of hiding it well again.  (Hopefully HOPE will not suffer the same<br/>
rock-disappearing issues that Double-Happiness faces from time to time.) <br/>
I was amazed at the number of people who stamped in given how young<br/>
this box is amount of time.<br/>
<br/>
Wethersfield:<br/>
The George Washington and Butoff Williams House Boxes.  Sadly,<br/>
the Cove park was closed - so we needed to save the Red Onion for<br/>
another day.  <br/>
<br/>
Peace to all.  And to other Connecticut Yankees - dont put those snow<br/>
throwers away just yet!<br/>
