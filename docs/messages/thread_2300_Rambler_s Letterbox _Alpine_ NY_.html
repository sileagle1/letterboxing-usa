<div>Greetings, All:</div>
<div>    St George and Cock o' the 
Trail finally returned to the scene of their very first letterboxing attempt on 
the nicest kind of day in May.  Having been advised after the first attempt 
that the long route to the letterbox really is long and that some of the clues 
had been removed, we consulted various maps of the region to give us better 
direction this time.  A very dry spring proved of considerable help in 
negotiating roads in otherwise deplorable condition, and we were able to find 
the stipulated foundation and thereafter the letterbox - a coffee can somewhat 
the worse for weather.  <strong>But there was nothing in it !!  
</strong>We left our stamps and notes on separate sheets of paper, replaced the 
can in its hiding place, and went on to enjoy a picnic, sitting in welcome 
sunshine on the retaining wall of a nearby bridge. Were disappointed, of course, 
at the lack of maintenance of this first letterbox beyond the early ones in 
eastern New York.  It's worthy of reinstatement but only with better advice 
as to the several-mile-long approach march.</div>
