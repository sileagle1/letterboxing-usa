                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree that this topic should be closed as soon as possible. But<br/>
first my 2 cents, of course.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the LBNA has no more liability than the AMC does for it's<br/>
hiking guides of the white mountains. Disclaimers (which in fact are<br/>
linked on many of the clues) do not prevent people from making stupid<br/>
mistakes. I discourage biraging the website with tons of disclaimers.<br/>
Signing waivers or providing tons of disclaimers still doesn't prevent<br/>
people from making stupid decissions.<br/>
<br/>
Even I have been on trips where I underestimated the<br/>
challenge. In many other cases I turned around when my mind/body is<br/>
telling me something just isn't right.  I would say that 10% of the boxes<br/>
I find are ones that required a second trip on a nicer and longer day.  I<br/>
figure the box is not going anywhere so what is the rush.<br/>
<br/>
Mabey it is because I had the fortunate training in scouts akin to Chip's.<br/>
But clearly anyone should be able to hear their minds telling them to turn<br/>
around. I realize that once you are on the hunt and feel very very close,<br/>
it is difficult to turn around. If you suffer from this I suggest reading<br/>
"Into thin air" for some insight.<br/>
<br/>
As for the clues:  I personally try to include the time and terrain<br/>
constrains partially for this reason, but more for those with kids or<br/>
constraints etc. I prefer to write with compass headings (North or 135deg)<br/>
rather than left or right because this is how I think about my orientation<br/>
in my environment. Others prefer left/right directions. In any case I<br/>
suggest people read up on the area that they are heading to.  Look at a<br/>
road map, get an idea of the major roads before you set out.  Bring<br/>
water/food/boots.  In fact, I treat this no different than a day hike in<br/>
the foot hills or mountains.<br/>
<br/>
The Wilderness when you are camping/hiking/surviving is still the same<br/>
wilderness when you are looking for a little tupperware box. And I don't<br/>
go into it without looking at a map...<br/>
