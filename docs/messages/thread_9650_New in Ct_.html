Eight Stamps carved by the Gang : Bluebird, Butterfly, Camel, and Lobsta.<br/>
<br/>
Marshland ~ Woodland ~ Water<br/>
The story<br/>
The Swans have been hanging in since the Kids Day Gather and were<br/>
beginning to feel lonely. Much to their surprise and delight some <br/>
friends began to<br/>
arrive. First the Damsel darted by and then the loud chattering of <br/>
Kingfisher broke the<br/>
silence in the marshes. Up in the high meadows Fritillary found a nest, <br/>
and the gobble<br/>
of turkeys seemed to be everywhere. Now and then even the splash of a <br/>
fish was noticed<br/>
in the waters.<br/>
The Clues:<br/>
Like the directions to Winter Camping Is For The Birds, this hunt begins <br/>
at Rocky Neck<br/>
State Park. Proceed all the way to the main parking lot . This is a loop <br/>
hike and<br/>
begins with the Rocky Neck Letterbox found by walking to the eastern end <br/>
of the parking<br/>
lot and find the fire hydrant by the edge of the park road . Walk due <br/>
south to the park<br/>
wooden fence , face east and walk along the fence . From the last post, <br/>
count back six<br/>
posts and in the north ,see a Cedar Tree. Find the beginning , Rocky <br/>
Neck Letterbox<br/>
there. Stamp in and rehide the box well.<br/>
Our Damsel has fled from the dragon and she has found a most wonderful <br/>
hiding spot.<br/>
To rescue this Damsel, walk south to the paved path and proceed between <br/>
the two low<br/>
buildings. Stand at the last two tall spruce trees and at a heading of <br/>
60 degrees , spot<br/>
two birch trees and a small Cedar tree. Look rightly for a storm split <br/>
oak-- good luck.<br/>
Damsels are tricky. Stamp in and hide well.<br/>
As you continue south easterly on the paved path and pass the large map<br/>
board you come to an interesting bridge over the river and under the <br/>
railroad tracks. walk<br/>
the bridge and head west along the beach . Go up the hill to the large <br/>
stone pavilion.<br/>
Here is where you meet the fishermans challenge to catch the fish. Walk <br/>
past the high<br/>
stone wall and down around the corner now heading north. A high rocky <br/>
ledge is west,<br/>
the stone wall of the Pavilion is east, and as soon as you walk past the <br/>
back corner of the<br/>
wall , spot a window that is  four over four low in the back <br/>
foundation. Stop here..<br/>
Now look west and notice a large tree growing almost out of the rock <br/>
ledge and the trunk<br/>
splits into two parts. Remember both the window and the tree. Make your <br/>
way up to the<br/>
top of the rocky ridge and find that tree, Stand where you can spot that <br/>
four over four<br/>
window through the V in the tree . Go fishing from this point by facing <br/>
250 degrees and<br/>
scrambling up over some rock ledges a way to a strange tree seemingly <br/>
growing right out<br/>
of a split rock. Go Fish!! Stamp in and release the catch back.into its <br/>
hiding hole. this is a<br/>
busy place so be careful .<br/>
Now go back up to the pavilion and walk along the front and onto the bridge<br/>
crossing over the railroad tracks. At the end of the bridge walk due <br/>
north up onto the<br/>
gravel path. On this unmarked gravel trail, pass a post #3 and into a <br/>
Laurel Forest .Pass<br/>
the large field on your left continue north and enter a laurel tunnel. <br/>
Soon notice a jumble<br/>
of rocks on the right side [south east ] of the trail guarded by a tall <br/>
Oak tree with green<br/>
feet. Stop here. Look 320 degrees to a small rock ledge, here is the <br/>
Fritillary tucked<br/>
under and resting in her nest. Stamp in and tuck her back .Continue on <br/>
the trail to<br/>
the next open field [ about 30 more steps ] This field is split by a <br/>
line of good size stones.<br/>
Turn and walk west to the park road and watch for dragons over head. Walk<br/>
left up the road a short way coming to a sign that says do not enter <br/>
The road curves<br/>
around and you will soon pass a Yellow Trail on your left . Make a <br/>
Resolution to take<br/>
the next trail which is the blue trail . Follow up and when the trail <br/>
splits, both trails are<br/>
blue and either one is right. Some call the right trail, the Mauve Trail ?<br/>
Turkeys live all around so listen as the trail begins to descend and <br/>
notice when the yellow<br/>
trail joins from the left. Soon after the trail levels off and heads <br/>
onto a long straight away.<br/>
Look to the end of the straight away at a knee high rock with a back split .<br/>
Stop here and at 120 degrees find a jumble of rocks at about 27 paces.<br/>
The largest rock looks like a sandwich -a Big Mac-if you are hungry- or <br/>
a Pac Man if you<br/>
are young. !! From this rock, the Turkey is hiding at 130 degrees under <br/>
an overhanging<br/>
ledge of rock Stamp in and then hide him good.<br/>
Continue on the Blue and soon come to the Red trail, turn right on red. <br/>
Aye Aye !! Hike<br/>
the Red Trail to the Park Road and turn left. Walk the park road down <br/>
and at the edge of<br/>
the woods on the left, find the white trail.. Sharp left onto the trail <br/>
and walk until you find<br/>
a large flat stone guarding the trail on your right. A seasonal brook is <br/>
now in sight. From<br/>
here at 150 degrees is the noisy Kingfisher in his nest at about 12 <br/>
steps. Return back to<br/>
the Park Road and now follow the edge of the marshlands to the Bride <br/>
Brook Salt Marsh<br/>
Observation Platform. Stand with your back to the identification chart. <br/>
Go 220 degrees to<br/>
the corner of the platform. You will find the Friends Forever letterbox <br/>
tucked beneath the<br/>
platform. Be sure to be discreet . Rehide the box carefully.<br/>
 From the Salt Marsh Observation Platform head east on the dirt trail <br/>
along the wood rail<br/>
fence to the corner of the fence. At the corner , take 20 steps straight <br/>
ahead on the path to<br/>
a small lone oak tree. Turn left and bushwack 40 degrees to a giant <br/>
pine. The Black Swan<br/>
lives here. Please rehide the box carefully when you are finished <br/>
stamping in.<br/>
Have a wonderful day .<br/>
