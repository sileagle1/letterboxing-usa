<br/>
First, did you get a trail map? The employees might not have known <br/>
which was the "blue trail" if the trail actually has a formal name. <br/>
I've found that some parks are not as "diligent" as others in <br/>
keeping the trails blazed, usually due to a lack of volunteers to do <br/>
the work.<br/>
<br/>
Did you ask a work crew or a ranger for directions? Work/landscaping <br/>
crews would be unlikely to know where the specific trails are. You'd <br/>
need to make sure you found a ranger or a knowledgeable volunteer <br/>
when asking directions.<br/>
<br/>
The box was planted a while back. There is every chance that some of <br/>
the markers and landmarks have disappeared due to weather/human <br/>
interference. The clues don't seem particularly vague to me; seemed <br/>
fairly standard walk-in-the-woods LBing clues to me.<br/>
<br/>
I'm in NC so I can't really give you any further insight. E-mail the <br/>
placer through LbNA and ask if they've had any recent reports on <br/>
this one.<br/>

equal.  There's a county forest preserve near me which has a paper trail map<br/>
they have available at the info kiosk in the preserve.  It doesn't have the<br/>
names of the trails on it.  If a person goes online and prints out a copy of<br/>
their online map, the map shows the trail names.  So sometimes, the more<br/>
maps, the better.  Don't leave home without 'em.  :-)<br/>
