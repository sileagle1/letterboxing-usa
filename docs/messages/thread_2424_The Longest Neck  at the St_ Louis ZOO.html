The Longest Neck  <br/>
<br/>
Locate the open air enclosure for these long necked animals.  Amazing aren't <br/>
they?  We have fond memories of the kids here.  :o)  Back up away from the <br/>
crowd that gathers there until you are near a fence and can see the crevice <br/>
leading to the very tall stall door... approx. 10-1/2 (eight year old) <br/>
strides.  At 101 degrees you should be lined up with a tree and the crevice <br/>
and be standing beside a fence near the donkey-ish animal.  Look down a small <br/>
flat rock should be there (and an amazing rolling fence rail that the kids <br/>
discovered!).  Set your stuff down over the fence next to the rock and lift <br/>
up the rock.  The Longest Neck should be there!<br/>
<br/>
  This is a micro box.  A black and gray film canister.  It holds nothing but <br/>
a note and a stamp.  To log in, please go to the website listed below.  :o)  <br/>
We are counting on you to put it back , well hidden, to avoid it being <br/>
mistaken for litter.  Depending on the time of day, this is a busy spot!<br/>
