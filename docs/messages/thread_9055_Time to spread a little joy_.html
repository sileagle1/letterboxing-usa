                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a glorious day!  I don't know what was better...the scenery, the <br/>
boxes, the Cobb sandwich at Eggspectations, or the new friends.  <br/>
<br/>
Sarah and I started our day by nabbing the Patty box left by Firefly <br/>
at Lake Elkhorn.  We then joined Firefly, Psychomommy, Squirrel, <br/>
Donna (Tempusfugit), Dandshoo (David and Sue), and the entire <br/>
Doubtful Guest clan (Thomas, Beryl, Cozy, and Tux the dog) at <br/>
Eggspectations in Columbia for a celebration in honor of Firefly <br/>
finding 100 boxes. <br/>
<br/>
The food was divine, the company exquisite, and we even had an event <br/>
stamp (courtesy of Sarah) and a personal traveller from Mudmommy.  <br/>
After the feast and revelry, we headed out to box.<br/>
<br/>
The group split into two at this point so look forward to a rousing <br/>
round up of events from Psychomommy soon.  (can't wait to hear about <br/>
the rest of your day!)  Squirrel, Donna, Sarah, and I headed out to <br/>
box Columbia and enjoy the trees.  <br/>
<br/>
All said, we came home with 8 exchanges, 1 traveller, 1 event stamp, <br/>
8 boxes, and the brand spanking new hitchhiker "Blue Meanie" that was <br/>
released into the wilds just yesterday by The Usual Suspects.  I'm so <br/>
happy I don't think I'll be able to sleep!<br/>
<br/>
Amidst the madness, Sarah and I also planted two new boxes with clues <br/>
to follow soon.<br/>
<br/>
Smiling so hard my face hurts,<br/>
