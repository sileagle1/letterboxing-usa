afternoon.  We went to find the Letterbox known as Busy Beavers in <br/>
Andover, MA.  We came to a point where we should have found the box, <br/>
but the entire trail was flooded (possibly from the rainstorm last <br/>
week).  I feel as if we were right there.  If the box was there, it <br/>
was submerged under approximately two feet of water.  It was placed <br/>
by Tung n Gruve.  If anyone has been to the site or if you are Tung <br/>
n Gruve, could you respond to us privately?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
