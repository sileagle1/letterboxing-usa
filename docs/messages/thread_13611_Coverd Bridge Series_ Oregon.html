If you are going to be in Grants Pass you should go for the Rainey Falls Letterbox and some others. You can drive to the Grave Creek river put in , and it would be a beautiful 2 mile  to Rainey Falls . Just make sure you know which side of the river the box is on. I think there is one at Indian Mary Campground area also. Don't think about hiking to our Paradise boxes from this area unless you are planning several days on the trail it's 24 miles from Grave Creek to Paradise. Ryan did the Paradise boxes a few years ago - he did the 12 in and 12 out in one day from Illahe . If you are going to Gold Beach you could take a great jet boat ride to Paradise lodge , have lunch, nab two boxes with a short hike and jet boat back to Gold Beach. Just thinking about the Rogue makes me want to pack up my boat and head north. Don<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the scoop!  My mother-in-law is going with us on this trip so I am trying to find some boxes that aren't too intensive as she is not very mobile.  I thought the bridge series would be perfect as they are pretty much drive-ups.  We may be able to get away for a bit so I will keep Rainey Falls in mind.<br/>
<br/>
I am really looking forward to heading into this area (as well as Lassen and Crater Lake) although snow may be an issue in some spots (namely, Lassen and Crater Lake).<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, we are going to bypass all the boxes around Castle Crags and Shasta Lake as we will be leaving the 5 at Red Bluff and rejoining it way up by Mount Shata.  We will be passing through those areas on the way back but we will already be making a 12+ hour drive back from Oregon Caves National Monument to LA so I don't think my wife would appreciate me stopping for letterboxes!  We'll just HAVE to make another trip back up there.  : )<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our Willows box Wild Goose might fit your trip. The best part is a 6 mile drive. Check area # 5 . Funhog's Ide Adobe area # 2 should be a good one also as there is not a lot of walking ,it's a neat location and the hiding spot is very gutsy. Your wife and mother in law would love this spot. Have a good trip. Gwen &amp; I are heading to Utah,Idaho,Wyoming and Montana. FYI we just finished up with # 26 in the Kernville area so when you need a break from LA  there is plenty up here to keep you busy. It's just a little warm right now. Don<br/>
