                    <div class="plaintext-content">Very level headed Monica! We just planted what I'm calling a CacheBox and<br/>
have posted it both here and on the Geocaching site. We used a clearly<br/>
labled ammo box and inside it is a clearly labled tupperware letterbox. We<br/>
will see how it goes but I feel the better job I do setting it up the harder<br/>
it will be for someone to goof it up.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; What are you really asking here? Are you using the poll to decide on<br/>
&gt; how you will go about trying to combine both sports?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If so, then in my opinion the best method is to just plant some boxes<br/>
&gt; that are letterboxes and some that are hybrids. And wait and see what<br/>
&gt; happens.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I planted one box that was a hybrid, and was very surprise to find<br/>
&gt; some Geocachers who had stamped in with really awesome stamps. These<br/>
&gt; people have never posted or planted a letterbox in the S.F. Bay Area<br/>
&gt; that I know of.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As to stamps being removed, it even happens to letterboxes.<br/>
&gt; Recently, people have posted that the box was there but the stamp had<br/>
&gt; vanished.<br/>
