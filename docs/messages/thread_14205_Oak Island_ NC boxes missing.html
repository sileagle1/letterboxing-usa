<br/>
I don't know what the protocol for listing a missing box is...I've <br/>
tried to find some info on the site and group, but to no avail. <br/>
Please forgive me if this is not the way to mention it and let me <br/>
know how.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we went boxing today in Oak Island, NC to find the 2 boxes <br/>
for that area. Neither were to be found. They are named "Devon's <br/>
Gift" and "The Marsh". <br/>
<br/>
An email addy was given for Devon's Gift, which we have written.<br/>
<br/>
Mystic Princess is listed in the directions of The Marsh, so if <br/>
you're out there...we couldn't find your box and we're pretty sure we <br/>
looked everywhere it could have been.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to contact us.<br/>
