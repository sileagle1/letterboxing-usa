<br/>
I'm a 50-year-old woman in decent shape, and since my husband is not an<br/>
outdoors fan, I also hike alone most of the time.<br/>
I have always felt much safer in the out of doors than in any town or city,<br/>
for the reasons Ryan talks about and for simple common sense reasons. Crooks<br/>
don't care for the outdoors much, either! Muggers don't like dirt, bugs or<br/>
weather--they want to be around lots of people so they can pick their next<br/>
easy mark. That means a town or city.<br/>
<br/>
This does not mean that random nutcases won't ever come your way; several<br/>
people have been murdered on the Appalachian Trail, most recently the two<br/>
women who were killed ostensibly because they were lesbians and the<br/>
murderer, a man, hated homosexuals. But this could have happened to these<br/>
poor girls anywhere! They just happened to go camping that weekend and the<br/>
jerk followed them.<br/>
<br/>
I do carry police-style mace handy and I have a loud whistle. Other than<br/>
that, I take my chances, listen to my intuition, and take moderate<br/>
precautions according to the conditions at hand. If we all stay scared all<br/>
the time that we will be attacked, hurt, etc., and allow the fear to ruin<br/>
the fun things we might do in life, then fear wins. Fear is already winning<br/>
out over common sense in this country over Sept. 11, and this is very<br/>
unhealthy and dangerous. Fear should only be an alert system or a warning<br/>
system, not a way to decide what you will do every minute of every day. Take<br/>
a few normal precautions, and then get out there and live it up!<br/>

There are nut-cases everywhere and you are not taking any more risk <br/>
walking alone in the woods than you are walking down a city street.  <br/>
While it is important to be aware and take precautions, a lot of it <br/>
is common sense and attitude.  You can't live in fear.  Fear makes <br/>
you weak, it makes you a victim.<br/>
<br/>
I've been hiking and camping alone for years, mostly in Michigan's <br/>
Upper Peninsula, northern Minnesota and NW Ontario, all areas where <br/>
it is quite common to hike an entire day and never see another <br/>
person.  My mother was always freaked out when I would head up there <br/>
alone, positive that I was going to fall victim to foul play.  I told <br/>
her I was more worried about bears than psychotic hikers.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of great posts on this topic with some very good suggestions.  <br/>
Thanks everyone!<br/>

&gt; precautions according to the conditions at hand. If we all stay <br/>
scared all<br/>
&gt; the time that we will be attacked, hurt, etc., and allow the fear <br/>
to ruin<br/>
&gt; the fun things we might do in life, then fear wins. Fear is already <br/>
winning<br/>
&gt; out over common sense in this country over Sept. 11, and this is <br/>
very<br/>
&gt; unhealthy and dangerous. Fear should only be an alert system or a <br/>
warning<br/>
&gt; system, not a way to decide what you will do every minute of every <br/>
day. Take<br/>
&gt; a few normal precautions, and then get out there and live it up!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just because I hike so much, Id like to throw in my two cents.<br/>
&gt; Hiking alone isnt a big deal.  Sure, theres always the possibility<br/>
&gt; of getting hurt, but just driving to work theres a chance of <br/>
getting<br/>
&gt; into a fatal car accident.  Staying at home there could be a gas<br/>
&gt; explosion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And its only on the remotest of trails that youre likely to be<br/>
&gt; truly alone.  Hiking on the Appalachian Trail I usually pass a<br/>
&gt; dozen or more people going the opposite way, and even more people <br/>
are<br/>
&gt; hiking the trail the same way as I am.  If I break a leg, it wont<br/>
&gt; take long for someone to find me and get some help.  If I fall off a<br/>
&gt; cliff, it wont take long for someone to discover my broken up body.<br/>
&gt; =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And as for the guy that cut off his arm--thats an extraordinary<br/>
&gt; event and the reason its so newsworthy is because it IS<br/>
&gt; extraordinary.  Him being alone wasnt the problem, but rather <br/>
nobody<br/>
&gt; knew he had left or where he went!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And keep in mind, that guy wasnt on a simple hike either....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With reasonable common sense, hiking alone isnt inherently more<br/>
&gt; dangerous than driving to work.  Youd all probably be surprised at<br/>
&gt; how many young, single women are thru-hiker the Appalachian Trail<br/>
&gt; alone.  And none of them have said theyve ever feared for their<br/>
&gt; safety while on the trail.  (Although in at least one case, one of<br/>
&gt; them had a close encounter with a car in a trail town.  Go figure.)<br/>

I've been hiking alone for a few years now.  I prefer to, many of my <br/>
friends and family have asked me to hike with them, and basically I <br/>
tell them I prefer to hike alone.  I like to hike for the solitude <br/>
and getting back to nature, it's just what I like to do.  It's my own <br/>
thing, I'm not recommending that anyone else do it, but that's what I <br/>
chooose to do.  <br/>
Funny thing, I'm reading "There are mountains to climb", by Jean <br/>
Deeds, a solo AT female hiker, who was 51 at the time of her hike.  <br/>
If she had listened to folks telling her not to hike alone, well...<br/>
Just to sum it up, I'm not telling anyone hiking alone doesn't have <br/>
risks, it does.  But there are risks hiking none the less, weather <br/>
alone or with another person.  Being prepared and having common sense <br/>
mitigate some of them, but you never know.  <br/>
