Fair warning. I know I should leave this alone. But, I<br/>
can't. Sorry in advance to anyone who reads this that<br/>
I offend, other than the originator of this thread,<br/>
but this is really pushing my buttons, for reasons<br/>
that will be clear soon. As for the original poster, I<br/>
don't care what you think.<br/>

&gt; I'm a bit taken back by this.  I realize that this<br/>
&gt; is a free country, <br/>
&gt; and that many people don't see the danger in<br/>
&gt; witchcraft, but is a <br/>
&gt; letterbox that glorifies the Occult proper for a<br/>
&gt; family oriented <br/>
&gt; hobby? <br/>
<br/>
How is it that a letterbox that is named "Witchcraft"<br/>
glorifies the occult? And what is it about witchcraft<br/>
that is dangerous?<br/>
<br/>
You see, my dear reverand, I happen to BE a pagan, and<br/>
many of my letterboxes involve various magical symbols<br/>
and glyphs from what you would call mythology and/or<br/>
witchcraft. Hell, I'm a founding member of a local<br/>
pagan organization that is seeking to become a legal<br/>
church, and one of my boxes is placed in honor of the<br/>
National Pagan Pride Day Project. And I've got a bunch<br/>
more planned. To me, they are religious symbols. And,<br/>
if it's ok for folks to put Christian religious<br/>
iconography and quotations in their letterboxes (and,<br/>
for the record, I do not find it offensive, and I have<br/>
hunted many boxes that have been planted by someone in<br/>
CT that contain Bible quotes in the logbooks. Some of<br/>
my favorite stamp images come from her boxes), then<br/>
it's ok for me to do so as well. It's definitely NOT<br/>
ok for you to come out and say that MY religion has no<br/>
business in a "family oriented" hobby. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; I'm particularly concerned that this<br/>
&gt; letterbox is <br/>
&gt; a "hitchhiker".  If I understand correctly, they are<br/>
&gt; a surprise form <br/>
&gt; of letterbox that travels around.  At least if it<br/>
&gt; was fixed, those of <br/>
&gt; us who did not want to be subjected to Satanic<br/>
&gt; influences could avoid <br/>
&gt; it. <br/>
<br/>
Are you that threatened by a word? Do you really think<br/>
that a piece of rubber can be satanic and/or evil? Are<br/>
you trying to imply that the person that began this HH<br/>
is a Satanist because of the name of this HH? And do<br/>
you realize that witches don't worship Satan, but<br/>
rather follow the old Gods that came before<br/>
Christianity? <br/>
<br/>
&gt; If it is a surprise, it could show up in any<br/>
&gt; letterbox.  I would <br/>
&gt; like to suggest that this letterbox be withdrawn, or<br/>
&gt; at a minimum be <br/>
&gt; made a fixed letterbox.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rev. Aloysius "Hallelujah" Hoyden<br/>
<br/>
I would like to suggest that you have no business<br/>
making that suggustion. YOU do not get to tell someone<br/>
else that is involved in this hobby how they can<br/>
participate. <br/>
<br/>
If you find the idea of this HH that offensive, don't<br/>
stamp it in your book, and don't take it with you.<br/>
<br/>
Since we're on the subject, if you ever find yourself<br/>
up in New England, you probably want to avoid most, if<br/>
not all, of the boxes that I've placed. In your<br/>
narrow-mindedness, you'd probably find them too<br/>
threatening as well.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Leviticus 19:31 Regard not them that have familiar<br/>
&gt; spirits, neither <br/>
&gt; seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the<br/>
&gt; LORD your God.  <br/>
<br/>
Quoting your holy book at me to justify bigotry does<br/>
not fly. Your God does not hold sway over everyone and<br/>
everything, and certainly does not over me.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I apologize to anyone that found my post<br/>
offensive, other than to the person it is directed at.<br/>
I am a committee member of our local chapter of the<br/>
Pagan Pride Project, and a founding member of the<br/>
Pioneer Valley Network of Pagans, and I cannot, in<br/>
good conscious, ignore this.<br/>
<br/>
In Service<br/>
