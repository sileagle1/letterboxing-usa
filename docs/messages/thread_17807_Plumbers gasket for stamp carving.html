plumbers gasket I asked for a piece to see if I liked it. He sent me <br/>
a 3ft.x3ft. piece !!! Seems it comes in a 3ft. wide strip so he just <br/>
cut off a square section. It's very thin and I've had no luck with <br/>
finding a way to transfer an image but it carves well. I don't think <br/>
it'll hold the ink too well either but I've not really carved with it <br/>
yet. Any hints on using it would be appreciated.<br/>
Rubaduc<br/>
p.s. Raindear, e-mail me off list and I could send you a small piece.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I tried it and didn't like it at all.  It is cheap though, I about a 12x12 inch piece from Lowes for about 60 cents.<br/>
<br/>
I tried new nibs, and my usual scalpel and didn't care for the results.  If you have a really steady hand you can get some fine lines, alas, too much caffinated tea for me!<br/>
<br/>
For those who have never used them, disposable scalpels are REALLY cheap, a box of 100 was less that $10 they're even cheaper if you know someone who uses they professionally (if ya know whutamean).  They are much sharper than an Xacto.  I would say under normal circumstances they are way too sharp for most kids, although all 4 of my girls have used them to carve (ages 6 to 11).  <br/>
