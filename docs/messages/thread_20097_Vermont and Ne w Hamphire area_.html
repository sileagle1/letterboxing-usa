Kent Pond very easy.  We did not get to James Taylor LB but it is one I'm sure <br/>
you would enjoy. We also went to the two @ Quechee Gorge.  They are  not that <br/>
far from Woodstock. <br/>
You might plan on planting one in the Woodstock area.  Maybe on the trails <br/>
near the new National Historic Park, near the Billings Farm  Museum.  That is a <br/>
very easy area but also very interesting particularly the national park- the <br/>
house &amp; it's history.<br/>
