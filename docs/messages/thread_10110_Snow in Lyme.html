I can't speak for Hartman, but Rocky Neck had an inch or 2 as of <br/>
today, and more is forecasted.  I hope you do make it to Hartman.  <br/>
It's a wonderful park and the boxes are great!<br/>

early Dec.  We stumbled across box #2 accidentally (should be relatively <br/>
easy to find in an inch or 2 of snow if you had the clues) it was water <br/>
logged and the stamp damaged.  Box #3 was also water logged but is <br/>
accessible in the snow (watch your step if there's snow cover though.  <br/>
Box #4 was in good shape and can be found with the current snow cover.<br/>
