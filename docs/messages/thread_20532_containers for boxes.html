is mega sturdy, but pretty pricey.<br/>
<br/>
A specimen cup has a larger diameter and volume (100-125 ml) than a 50 ml<br/>
centrifuge tube and costs less than a Nalgene jar.<br/>

OK, just had to get that "desiccant" spelling right-- two "C"s and one "S".<br/>
Sorry, folks, it's on the frequently misspelled words list, along with<br/>
"misspelled" and I have a spelling-bee-er in my household! Now, with that<br/>
out of the way, I have to say I really don't like those Rubbermaid<br/>
containers. I've found about 2 dry ones in 6 months of letterboxing, and<br/>
many with chewed holes. They're just too thin and don't seal well. I<br/>
remember someone listing a website on here, maybe 3-5 months ago, with some<br/>
kind of science tubes or earth tubes or geo-tubes or something to that<br/>
effect. They were made for being outside. I think they were thicker plastic,<br/>
maybe w/ screw-on lids? And were bigger in diameter than centrifuge tubes<br/>
you're describing. Maybe I dreamed the whole thing as my ideal letterbox. I<br/>
saved the post... will see if I can find it &amp; keep you<br/>
posted! --lunaryakketyact<br/>
