Took a few days to visit the Sprite's family just outside of Dallas <br/>
and was delighted to find boxing action in the most unlikely of <br/>
places. Upstate NY lends itself to boxing because of the woods and <br/>
other unspoiled areas, but we were impressed with how easily the <br/>
Celtic Lions, Ruby Tuesday and Cactus Licker were able to turn an <br/>
urban sprawl into prime boxing territory! We got to see a BEAUTIFUL <br/>
park with fountains behind the Mary Kay headquarters, saw an old <br/>
homestead not far from my family and other great locations in the <br/>
area. We even got two couples involved with us for the day who're <br/>
going to LOVE joining the North Texas boxing community.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Thanks for Giving...boxes, that is! We loved it!<br/>
