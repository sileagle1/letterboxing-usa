difficult to find a location that is central and convenient for a <br/>
majority of folks.  Even though the location is central to those who <br/>
expressed an interest in the event, it is still almost a 4-hr. drive <br/>
for some.  Most of the Cincinnati area boxers are not planning to <br/>
come because they routinely have gatherings in their area and it is a <br/>
long drive from down at the bottom of Ohio, ditto for the SW tip of <br/>
Illinois, and even Upper Michigan.  On the other hand, we have a <br/>
couple of people coming from PA and also VA.  <br/>

Certainly anyone from WI or any other state (with or without Great <br/>

Neither will Gov. Granholm ;))<br/>
<br/>
On a serious note, we would love to have you and your Mom, Lucy. When the<br/>
title for the gathering came about, as I am sure has happened in the<br/>
planning of many gatherings, no one was meant to be excluded just because<br/>
their state wasn't mentioned. On the contrary, the more the merrier! Of<br/>
course I have yet to see the mondo 50 state summer pow wow to be planned,<br/>
but boxers are boxers and the standard is everyone is welcome.<br/>

Perhaps you should bring baby food jars with a bit of beach sand and<br/>
some Lake Michigan water for any who are not from 'official' Great Lakes<br/>
states!  <br/>
<br/>
And now that I've finally jumped in with a comment...  my name is Diana,<br/>
my 'handle' is MommaDi.  I'm quite new to LB, I was introduced to it<br/>
through an event held by Dog Scouts last fall.  I missed most of the<br/>
event, but ScoutDog was kind enough to teach me how to use a compass,<br/>
helped me through a test run that was laid just for me, and then we went<br/>
out for a couple hours.  I didn't have my stamp(s) made yet, so I only<br/>
signed in on my very first find: SpringChick's Ghosts Below.  I stumbled<br/>
across the Mystery Boxes while doing my homework in preparation for the<br/>
event, thought I recognized the photo, so spent some time deciphering<br/>
the clues.  We had a blast!<br/>
<br/>
I LB with my two best friends, Josh and Trav'ler.  We've been waiting to<br/>
get backpacks for Trav'ler before we get out in earnest. (They can earn<br/>
merit badges if they pack their own stuff while hunting boxes, and if<br/>
they carry all the stuff required by Dog Scouts, I can use my GPS to<br/>
record our mileage, and they can work on their backpack titles as well.)<br/>
I've just decided, however, I'm not going to worry about qualifying for<br/>
the badges or title; we're just going to get out there and have some<br/>
fun.  I don't have any money, but this is something we can do pretty<br/>
much for free!!!  And it's good for us!<br/>
