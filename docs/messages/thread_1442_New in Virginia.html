been.  On a crisp fall day, when the Rams prevail....These stamps <br/>
you'll find on The Beaver Lake Trail.<br/>
<br/>
Just south of Richmond, and north of Petersburg, Pochahontas State <br/>
Park is located in Chesterfield, Virginia on State Rt. 655 (Beach <br/>
Road).<br/>
<br/>
To reach the Beaver Lake Trail, go straight after entering the park, <br/>
and turn left into the Visitor Center parking lot.  The trail is a 3-<br/>
mile loop with a few minor hills.  Very kid and pet friendly.  The <br/>
Beaver Lake Trail leaves the Visitor Center combined with the Ground <br/>
Pine Nature Trail.  After descending west along the lakeshore for 1/4 <br/>
mile, the Ground Pine path goes right and the Beaver Lake Trail <br/>
continues with the lakeshore.  A short paved section begins at a <br/>
signpost to Spillway Trail.  Follow that and the Spillway will be on <br/>
your left. Across the bridge, the Beaver Lake Trail bears sharp left <br/>
to the first overlook.  Bear another left uphill.  At about 1 1/2 <br/>
miles, the trail reaches the site of an old gristmill.<br/>
<br/>
Box #1<br/>
<br/>
At the old mill site, before you cross the stream, locate a pair of <br/>
trees whose trunks are carved.  Pass them by and follow the stream to <br/>
the right to a tree trunk that says "I Love Greg."  Find the thin <br/>
tree growing our to a thick tree and from that point, scramble up the <br/>
hill to find a flat boulder nestled between a trio of trees.  The <br/>
base of the boulder behind you to the right is where Box #1 will be <br/>
found.  Stamp in and rehide carefully with leaves and branches to <br/>
keep box from view.<br/>
<br/>
Return to the trail and soon you will cross a wooden boardwalk.<br/>
<br/>
Box #2<br/>
<br/>
On the boardwalk, When you have just 47 boards to the end, leave the <br/>
bridge to the left and find the tree with the hole in it facing the <br/>
stream.  Hidden in that hole you'll find Box #2.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hiking and Hunting!<br/>
