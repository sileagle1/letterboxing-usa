<br/>
I would like to thank all the organizers and participants in what <br/>
turned out to be a *splendid* afternoon at the Moravian Tile <br/>
Works in Doylestown, PA. on the 28th.<br/>
<br/>
It was great putting faces to many of the names (and stamps!) <br/>
that I've been seeing both on the list, and in the logbooks <br/>
scattered about the area.<br/>
<br/>
A special Tip 'O the Hat to Ed (dman10327) for organizing the <br/>
event. He carved the Event Stamp, and placed a new letterbox for <br/>
those of us who were lucky enough to be able to attend.<br/>
<br/>
And a very *special* thanks to all of those who travelled many <br/>
miles (in some cases HUNDREDS of miles) to hang out with us <br/>
on a lovely Saturday afternoon. I hope for you, the event was <br/>
worth the trouble.<br/>
<br/>
It was also a chance to get my wife to see some of what goes on <br/>
with regards to letterboxing in general. Her experience thus far <br/>
has been:<br/>
<br/>
1) ACE prints out a new map, with clues<br/>
<br/>
2) ACE and GEKO dash out of the house on a Sunday afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
3) [wait three hours]<br/>
<br/>
4) ACE and GEKO return, covered in mud - proudly bearing new <br/>
stamps.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure that seeing somewhat normal people at the event, has <br/>
eliminated some of the mystery that must have surrounded the <br/>
hobby in her mind.<br/>
<br/>
For GEKO and myself, we has such a wonderful time - it's had <br/>
the added benefit of extending the distance we'd be willing to <br/>
travel to meet you all again in the future.<br/>
<br/>
We hope to see you all again, real soon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
