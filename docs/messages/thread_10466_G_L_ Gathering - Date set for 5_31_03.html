<br/>
Because it's centrally located, I recommend the park where the first<br/>
Michigan box was placed (April Fools), at Hudson Mills Metropark in Dexter,<br/>
Michigan (between Jackson and Ann Arbor). (Here is the link to the clues:<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/Canopy/7962/apfool.htm). It is a lovely<br/>
park and the Huron River runs through it -- with excellent kayaking. There<br/>
is a day pass fee (I think it's $4 or something like that).<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
Ruthann<br/>
