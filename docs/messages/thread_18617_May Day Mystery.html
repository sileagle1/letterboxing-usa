<br/>
Only a couple of days until the May Day Gathering!  The boxes are done and hidden!  You'll be getting clues when you get there!<br/>
<br/>
There is one very special box..........it's a mystery!  During the course of the day you need to be on the lookout for the clues.  If and when you are lucky enough to find this special box we are asking that you be VERY, VERY discreet.  Please don't give away the clues or the location of the box.  We want to see how many people actually find it all on their own!<br/>
<br/>
OH!  And would everyone please bring an umbrella!!  We figure that if everyone brings one then we shouldn't need them!<br/>
<br/>
See you all Sunday!<br/>
