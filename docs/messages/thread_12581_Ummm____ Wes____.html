That's why you shouldn't program at two in the morning.  You forget things like . . . turning the site back on.<br/>

You're programming on our behalf at two in the morning?!  No apology could <br/>
ever be necessary.  Flaming a considerate, self-sacrificing and noble <br/>
webmaster such as yourself would be an unthinkable transgression.  Should <br/>
anyone actually be ill-bred, arrogant, devolved, nose-picking, <br/>
mouth-breathing, poultry-lusting, rude enough to commit such an unpardonable <br/>
act, I urge them to send me their name and address so I can have my friend <br/>
Hawg come and visit them immediately. ;)<br/>

   LOL, poultry-lusting! If I didn't know different I would have <br/>
thought this was Tammy's (ADG#1) words. <br/>
   My sincere appreciation to Wes and all the webmasters for <br/>
undertaking this job on their free time!<br/>
   I new nothing about computers and how they work this time last <br/>
year. I equate it to driving my car. Don't know how it works but it <br/>
gets me where I need to go. <br/>
