<div>    Fuzzy Wuzzy was a fuzzy wooly 
bear.   Fuzzy Wuzzy wuz looking  for a place for a winter 
lair.   He started on rte 195 in Manfield Center and turned onto 
Puddin La. just north of East Brook mall. The trail head is marked by a very 
large rock there is parking for just 2-3 cars. This is the start of the Nipmuck 
in Mansfield. Fuzzy Wuzzy new this was where to look for a cozy home . 
</div>
<div>    Up the 
trail went Fuzzy Wuzzy leaving hundreds of footprints in his path. It is a  
long climb if your the  Fuzzy Wuzzy type , up , up , up. He passed a tree 
shaped like a fork with meat stuck in it, but Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't hungry wuz he. 
</div>
<div> Next he crossed a stream bed and wuz happy it wuz dry 
this season, Fuzzy Wuzzy hates wet socks by the hundreds. </div>
<div>    On went Fuzzy Wuzzy to a place that smelled 
like Christmas, but Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't happy here wuz he? No, on he went. 
</div>
<div>     He passed Woodpecker apartments but 
they make noisy neighbors, all that tapping so on  he marched, left, left, 
lft, left, right , right, right,and so forth. Can you picture Fuzzy Wuzzy  
on a stairmaster here we go............... Whew!</div>
<div>    When he was tired of climbing he rested at 
a tree that looked like a chair for a Fuzzy Wuzzy king. This was to rich a 
neighborhood , so Fuzzy Wuzzy   Went on , you should too. 
</div>
<div>     Pass  a tree bridge on the right 
and climb as Fuzzy Wuzzy did, it is a pretty neighborhood here. Up , up, 
up,  the trail our friend Fuzzy Wuzzy climbed. </div>
<div>  " We are near people houses this just won't 
do!"  so Fuzzy Wuzzy followed the trail as it turns right , note 2 
blue dots mark a change in dirction. Fuzzy knew this too.  A white trail 
crosses thats for skiing, Fuzzy Wuzzy didn't want to be sqished so he ..... went 
on. </div>
<div>   Then Fuzzy Wuzzy came to a big bed no oone would 
sleep in, glad his many feet stayed dry he went on. </div>
<div>  Next he saw the biggest rock chair EVER! He kept going 
to many people visit the chair.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>  Fuzzy Wuzzy was tired he wanted to find a home soon a 
cool wind told him to hurry. Then there was a logging sight he could almost here 
the distant cry " Timber" if you were Fuzzy Wuzzy would you live here? 
Never you would get squished so on. The trail was nice then more logging, Yuck 
what should aFuzzy Do?</div>
<div>     Just after the looging Fuzzy found 
twin trees. One was dead but they stood together at the right edge of the trail. 
What  a  nice spot to live I can watch all the 4-H kids go by.  
So fuzzy Wuzzy crawled in by the trees near a rock and snuggled down as a Fuzzy 
Wuzzy should when leaves turn and the wind blows cool.  If you should find 
Fuzzy Wuzzy home he would be happy for you to  mark his guest book , but 
keep his home a secret , he would not want the birds to hear where he was 
sleeping.  We would not want other hikers to know either.  Have fun, 
bring dry socks if rainy season. </div>
