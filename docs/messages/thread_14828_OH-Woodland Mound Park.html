We understand that 'boxers have their bad outings every now and then but<br/>
yesterday we had about 18 clues in hand for Woodland Mound Park and NOT<br/>
ONE was found.  We KNEW we were in the right spot for a few of them and<br/>
they simply WERE NOT THERE.  Does anyone have any information about this<br/>
park?  A friend of mine told me today that park rangers roost in the<br/>
trees with binoculars watching the goings-on within the place.  A very<br/>
discouraging letterboxing hunt, to say the least.  Beautiful view<br/>
though.  We saw an osprey, some tadpoles, a baby toad and  ALOT OF<br/>
PEOPLE!!  <br/>

(That's conservative Cincinnati for you !<br/>
2 rangers for every nature lover )<br/>
<br/>
I haven't been to Woodland Mound park all summer except to check on my<br/>
NightMoves letterbox. It was in its place a couple of weeks ago along<br/>
with a snake taking up residency in my l'box too.<br/>
<br/>
Wow I am assuming that the park staff must of pulled all my boxes .<br/>
I haven't placed a box in that park for a year or so because I heard<br/>
that the little rangers were upset that some one was enjoying the park<br/>
without THERE PERMISSION or KNOWABOUTS.!<br/>
<br/>
They themselves placed 5 boxes and published them in there little<br/>
"Evergreen Magazine" and made a contest out of finding all 5<br/>
letterboxes.<br/>
I guess its THERE PARK and not mine to enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Well I just place boxes in non public park situations and try to not<br/>
step on any feet.<br/>
But I am just assuming that they pulled them because of the percentage<br/>
of missing boxes ! <br/>
I will get up that way and check the locations out for you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the update.<br/>
Sorry about your lost boxing time ....they were some  cool stamps too.<br/>
bummer !<br/>
<br/>
I think  had about 6 boxes in that park.<br/>
<br/>
Later ,<br/>
