                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone,<br/>
 My name is Oro and and my wife, Paula, and I just learned of <br/>
letterboxing. It turns out that we live in an area that has quite a <br/>
few boxes in a 100 mile area. We are looking forward to finding as <br/>
many as possible.<br/>
 We live in western Maryland, well off the beaten path. Country life <br/>
suits us both. We have 3 large dogs that are a family. Male, female, <br/>
and pup. The pup is the biggest at 125. The daddy is the small one at <br/>
102. We all 5 like to camp and hike and alot of other outdoor <br/>
activities. <br/>
 Short and sweet,<br/>
My 1.5 cents (inflation)<br/>

Flash out... <br/>
