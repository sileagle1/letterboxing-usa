In the case of Land Sailing Newport, "not found" doesn't mean "missing." <br/>
Please don't let others stop you from looking for this one: it is confirmed <br/>
to be among the living. It just ain't "easy."<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, listing letterbox status is an iffy business, and I feel it is <br/>
best to only call 'em missing if they're your own. Maybe instead call them <br/>
"not found." The letterboxing.org site is surprisingly up to date but the <br/>
webmasters much prefer to hear directly from owners that boxes are gone.<br/>
<br/>
Along with counting lizards (we're still at 0 here in New England), I've been <br/>
counting "Not Missing After Alls" for almost two years. I have (counting <br/>
DrewClan boxes only) 37 incorrect reports along the lines of "I'm absolutely <br/>
sure I was in the right place, even saw the tell tale pile of stones, and the <br/>
box is missing." Tonights makes 38.<br/>
<br/>
LbNA has taken box listings down without owner's permission when it's pretty <br/>
certain that both the box and the owner are indeed missing, but we've been <br/>
proven wrong in so many cases that that this Rhode Island example is not <br/>
unique.<br/>

Indeed.  And don't forget those rare, but certainly interesting,<br/>
cases where the planter _intentionally_ makes a place look like <br/>
a-box-was-here-but-went-missing ... ;-)<br/>

(well, I figured I'd come up with some stats before the entire alphabet<br/>
was colonized ... and these may even be useful to those who hunt my<br/>
boxes ... Q, which is sort of like P, is number of states planted in (and<br/>
yes, the race with Funhog to 50 is on :-), and S, which is sort of like<br/>
"state", is the number of states we've found one in ...)<br/>

How's this Jay?  I am "almost positive" we were in the right place at the right pile of rocks, but there was nothing there.  Has anyone seen these since September?  Just curious.<br/>

Dear Deb and Dad, <br/>
Thanks for the tip about the boxes being missing. Tweety and I went <br/>
out to check on Saturday and nearly got blown away ourselves. We <br/>
replaced The Letterboxer one in a new spot a few feet away but a tad <br/>
farther from the path (under a new cairn behind the end fencepost). <br/>
We couldn't found what we could agree on as a suitable spot to <br/>
replace the Fisherman so we are mulling it over. We hope to get it <br/>
back this weekend and will post new directions. The Stroller was in a <br/>
tricky spot and is long gone for sure, anyway the Hike it or Bike it <br/>
guys box is near there and serves to draw attention to that neat <br/>
spot.  Thanks again for the tip.      Mr. Coon <br/>
<br/>
