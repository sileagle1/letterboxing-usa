&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hello, today we went to find your letterbox but came up empty <br/>
handed.We don't understand your clues, not that there bad, we just <br/>
don't get it.What is W 9 and LX0020 or S59W is this Military talk.We <br/>
went over the bridge and looked around a fallen down mill on the <br/>
right, then crossed the street and looked by the river, but we can't <br/>
seem to find the right 17 foot drop with the 5 foot ledge.We even <br/>
looked up by the RR tracks.I showed the clues to a couple of <br/>
Letterboxing friends of mine and they didn't understand them <br/>
either.Could you give us a bigger hint as to where to look, we must <br/>
be close? I,m sorry but we just don't know what those numbers <br/>
mean.Signed clueless lol.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
___________________________________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
I feel very bad that!!<br/>
<br/>
I don't feel bad about the LX0020 or W  9 clues. What I do feel bad <br/>
about the S59W. It should have been S59E. It's a typo--I hit the <br/>
wrong key when I type the clue. I didn't even catch when <br/>
proofreading. Since I botched that up, I will, this one time, divulge <br/>
the other numbers. S59E is the bearing South 59 degrees East. You can <br/>
figure out how to change a true bearing into a magnetic azimuth. W  9 <br/>
is the old name for National Geodetic Survey marker LX0020. Go to <br/>
http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/ and type in the PID (permanent <br/>
Identification) LX0020 under datasheets. The datasheet will contains <br/>
the 70-year history of LX0020 plus plenty of clues to the start place <br/>
for Baltic Mills Letterbox. When you are standing on LX0020 you are <br/>
literally a stone's though away from the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for the mix up earlier. I made the clue very orienteering <br/>
heavy cause everybody argues over the definition of pace. I have a <br/>
half dozen letterboxes going out in the next couple of weeks, they <br/>
will all start from a NGS PID station (LX0019 for example). I like <br/>
them because they are permanent engraved cemented mounted monuments <br/>
with documented histories. I also like them because if you don't what <br/>
a standard pace is or if you insist on using paces to markd distances <br/>
instead of feet or meters, then you probably don't what a PID <br/>
monument/Survey Marker is. This will be the only time I explain where <br/>
to find that data. I wanted to make amends for the earlier typo and I <br/>
don't want to spoil the chase for anyone else. This message will <br/>
serve as an internet letterbox to really fair and for the really <br/>
curious.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and sorry about that!!!<br/>
