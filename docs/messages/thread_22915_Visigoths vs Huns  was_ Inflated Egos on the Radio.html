&gt; The scoundrel! Hiding behind his REAL name. He probably made <br/>

&gt; letterbox! You posted your mean spirited opinion Miss Moon... now <br/>
&gt; you can hear my opinion: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This "attack" of yours was ignorant, unfair and most of all <br/>
&gt; unwarranted.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What evidence do you have that there was any damage to the <br/>
&gt; institution of letterboxing that has occurred as result of this <br/>
&gt; broadcast in April 04? As all ltterboxers will learn when they go <br/>
&gt; listen to the program, Mr. Jonston was an excellent spokesman on <br/>
an <br/>
&gt; appropriate venue. Who do you think listens to NPR Saturday <br/>
morning? <br/>
&gt; The Huns &amp; Visigoths from the Capital One commercials? (What's in <br/>
&gt; your wallet?)  Since this broadcast was twenty months ago and two <br/>
&gt; months before she started letterboxing... one assumes that Miss <br/>
Moon <br/>
&gt; can elaborate on exactly how much damage this NPR story actually <br/>
&gt; did...(don't speculate...it's in the past now... so where is the <br/>
&gt; evidence?) and more importantly why she feels empowered to <br/>
&gt; publically launch a personal attack on Tom, a very respected <br/>
member <br/>
&gt; of this community. <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As more and more people take up this hobby, seemingly in droves, <br/>
&gt; there <br/>
&gt; &gt; will be more missing boxes, more poorly re-hidden boxes, more <br/>
&gt; &gt; vandalized boxes, as *most* of these droves of people get bored <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; move onto another weekend activity. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; To steal a phrase I read recently on another list, we do not <br/>
need <br/>
