<div>The lonemasswolf is going to be in Portland, Oregon

<div>He will also be there for letterboxing business on

<div>While I am there I sure would like to meet some of

It would be great to see you while you're in Portland.  Maybe we can get<br/>
together a little something going on with the local letterboxers.  I<br/>
have symphony tickets the night of the 3rd, but other than that maybe we<br/>
can get something going.  <br/>
<br/>
We had warm, sunny weather up till this past weekend and now it's the<br/>
fine Oregon fall.  You may want to bring your raingear and a good hat to<br/>
keep the liquid sunshine from soaking through.  <br/>
<br/>
Which boxes did you have in mind to search for?  That way if we have a<br/>
get together we can do it on a convenient side of town for all. <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know.  I'm sure we can think of something!!!  It will be<br/>
great to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>

I'd have to check my calendar (which isn't with me at the moment) to <br/>
see what days or times I have available, but I'm sure I could find <br/>
some free time at some point during your Portland visit to meet up <br/>
with you.<br/>
<br/>
As for looking for some letterboxes, do you intend to find as many as <br/>
possible, or go to the most scenic places and pick up whatever is <br/>
available along the way.  (Quantity vs. quality)  There's a billion <br/>
or so box right here in Portland, but if you've never seen the <br/>
Columbia River Gorge, Mount Hood, the coast, or whatever, they're not <br/>
to be missed--letterboxes or not.  There are some letterboxes at all <br/>
of those locations, but not hardly in the quantity you'd find in the <br/>
parks in Portland and suburbs.<br/>
<br/>
Or, you could check out Amanda's and my stamp logs first, to see <br/>
which stamps are the ones you most want to capture.  ;o)<br/>
