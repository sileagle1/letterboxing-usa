Nature Preserve in Salem, CT. Got some boxes and the Field Trip HH. <br/>
Put out some new ones that she'll be telling you all about in the <br/>
near future. <br/>
<br/>
Ya know? For 72... she wore us out on the trails!!!!    Seriously, <br/>
great spot, nice hike, and Maddie had a blast swimming in the lil <br/>
river on the way back. Some muddy spots and if you decide to hike <br/>
the pink trail, keep a good eye on the trail markers b/c it was not <br/>
an easy trail to follow. There's one muddy spot on the back 9 of the <br/>
pink that you may have to find your own crossing and skip across a <br/>
few rocks. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a wonderful morning Butterfly!!!<br/>
