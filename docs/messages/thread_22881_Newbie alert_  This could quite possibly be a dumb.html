An interesting idea. The stamp is arguably the most important part of a <br/>
letterbox, so you <br/>
would have to start with the stamp, progress to the logbook, then the other <br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Has anyone ever thought of doing a "progressive letterbox"?  Starts out as a <br/>
hitchhiker, <br/>
but with only one component... let's say the container.  The letterboxer who <br/>
finds the <br/>
progressive hitch-hiker adds another component... let's say a hand-carved stamp.  <br/>
The <br/>
final letterboxer would add the last component (ie., the log) and any other <br/>
additional <br/>
goodies they wish and would send the completed letterbox on its way as a <br/>
full-fledged <br/>
hitch-hiker.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Another variation would be a "round robin" by mail.  Letterboxer #1 sends <br/>
letterboxer <br/>
#2 an empty log.  Letterboxer #2 puts it in a container and mails it to <br/>
letterboxer #3.  <br/>
Once its a completed letterbox, it could be mailed to the originator for <br/>
planting or could <br/>
become a hitch-hiker passed along by the person who completes it with its final <br/>
component.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Like I said, I'm a real newbie!  This is day #2 for me in the hobby.  I have <br/>
one virtual find <br/>
and one physical find so far.  No plants or exchanges yet.  But today was my <br/>
first physical <br/>
find, and I have to say, that was QUITE exciting!!!!! :D<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; So, anyone, these ideas could be dumb or already-tried or whatever, but I just <br/>
thought <br/>
of them and thought I'd pass them along.  Thanks!<br/>

There's a Postal Letterbox going around now named Pimp My Letterbox, <br/>
the idea springing from the TV show Pimp My Ride. It started with a <br/>
basic stamp/log and everyone on the list will jazz it up in some way.<br/>
