<br/>
Just wanted to let you know that the Columbia River Slough Series is<br/>
going to change.  Letterboxes 5 &amp; 6, which are accessible by land are<br/>
still there and the clues are still good.  <br/>
<br/>
However, the water-accessible boxes that were have been removed.  Mother<br/>
Nature and construction crews have reeked havoc on a couple of my hiding<br/>
places.  (One of the contractors called and dropped my Letterbox #4 off.<br/>
It's hiding spot behind a concrete pipe was completed demolished!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...though a couple members of LBNA have expressed interest since<br/>
the boxes were planted last fall, these boxes were never sought by<br/>
anyone but John's and my family members.  <br/>
<br/>
The GOOD NEWS is that we will soon place these first four letterboxes on<br/>
trails along various parts of the slough in Portland so that everyone<br/>
can reach them on foot and enjoy getting them without needing access via<br/>
paddlecraft.  Hopefully, once we place them and post the clues, it will<br/>
generate some activity in the log books and give people some cool new<br/>
spots to hike around and give them some new images to hunt down.  Some<br/>
of the stamps aren't half bad, actually.  <br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
