I will definitely be up for letterboxing and exchanging, you guys <br/>
will have to coordinate together. I will be out of touch after a <br/>
minute. I already emailed my cell # to a couple of you off of the <br/>
list and you guys know where I will be staying. I get into town <br/>
around 11am and would love to meet up with whoever can make it!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey Amanda!  Wanna exchange stamps?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you're able to set something up with her, please let me know.  <br/>
&gt; I'll be in Providence off and on throughout the day, and it would <br/>
be <br/>
&gt; great to make an exchange.  Maybe Rustypuff could come down to meet <br/>
&gt; her too.<br/>

When are you guys meeting up with Amanda? We've got LAX (Lacrosse, <br/>
honey, not the airport) but I'd love to see that cute Nancy Drew <br/>
stamp again...<br/>
