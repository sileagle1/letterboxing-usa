<body>Two new boxes in western CT.
<br/><b></b> <b></b>
<p><b>On the Leathermans Trail</b>
</p><p>2 boxes placed Nov. 24, 2001
<br/>by Aili &amp; Bruce
<br/>Moderate-plus, about 2+ hours.
</p><p>Mattatuck TrailMap 21 in the Blue BookThomaston, CT (Litchfield County)
</p><p>Getting There: From Route 8 to Route 6 West, pass Black Rock SP entrance.
Watch for blue oval sign and roadside parking where trail crosses Route
6.  Hunting is allowed in this area, wear orange in the fall. Hike
covers a lot of bare rock which is slippery when wet or snowy, so use caution
and allow extra time. It's a beautiful walk in every season.
</p><p>Cross to East side of Route 6 and enter trail. Follow Blue-blazed Mattatuck
trail, uphill and across the first few of several ledges with views.
</p><p>On one of these ledges, look for a slab of rock resting on the trail
which contains a football-sized quartz inclusion [this may be easier to
spot on the way back]. Standing on the slabs upper-most point, take 2
steps in the direction of 55° to a small cluster of oak, elm and laurel.
Just under your feet you will find the <b>Chunk o Quartz</b> letterbox
tucked under the rocks edge.
</p><p>Continue on Blue Trail, which meets with and overlaps the yellow-blazed
Jericho Trail. Stay with the Blue blazes, up to Cranes Lookout. Here the
trail does a kind of u-turn, almost paralleling itself before going below
the Lookout to the Leathermans Cave. The Trail actually passes through
the Cave. Just after your exit, go to the right. Before the tipped tree,
look to the right and find the <b>Old Leatherman </b>sleeping under some
rocks on the shelf, sheltered by the ledge.</p></body></html>
