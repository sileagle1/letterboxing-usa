                    <div class="plaintext-content">On May 16, 2002 Funhog placed El Oso Gordo Letterbox near the Pueblo of <br/>
Nambe, Santa Fe County, New Mexico. Like most of his brothers this fat <br/>
little bear hibernates during the winter months. So don't bother to <br/>
hunt for him between mid-November and mid-March. Call the ranger at 505 <br/>
455 2304 for open dates. This steep trail has loose rocks, sand and <br/>
precipitous edges but is quite short. <br/>
<br/>
to the trailhead: About 20 miles north of Santa Fe on Route 285 you <br/>
will come to the junction with Route 503. Go east about three miles to <br/>
the sign for Nambe Lake and Falls. Turn right here and continue to the <br/>
park entrance where you will be required to pay a $5 fee for <br/>
"sightseeing." Go downhill to the right. Once at the picnic area keep <br/>
left and park at the end of the road.<br/>
<br/>
to the letterbox: Once you leave your car you will see bear tracks. The <br/>
little bear you're searching for has a cozy den with a waterfall view. <br/>
He IS fat but not lazy! Follow the tracks that amble over the river, <br/>
through the woods, and up a mountain. When you can go no further, face <br/>
the torrent. The largest pine tree around, a great spot for a bear to <br/>
scratch his back, will be on your left. Above and behind you will be a <br/>
small bush sprouting from between two rocks. El Oso Gordo has his den <br/>
behind the upper rock. Watch for snakes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On October 25, 2002 Funhog placed the Rancho de Estrellas letterbox at the J. W. Eaves Movie Ranch <br/>
near the town of Santa Fe, Santa Fe County, New Mexico. Since this ranch is a working movie set, it may <br/>
be closed for filming. When it's open, they offer tours ($10.) I placed this drive-by box early on a fall <br/>
morning when no one was about, in an area free of no trespassing signs.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: from I-25 take exit 271/La Cienaga. Go south on the frontage road along the east side <br/>
of the highway to Bonanza Creek Road. Turn left and drive 5.6 miles to Rancho Alegre, marked by a large <br/>
adobe sign. Go right 1/2 mile to the Ranch.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: From the Stars and Bars,160 degrees magnetic will guide you to a hard-hearted trio. <br/>
The central character guards the letterbox.<br/>
