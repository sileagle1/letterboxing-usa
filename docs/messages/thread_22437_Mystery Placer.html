                    <div class="plaintext-content">Me, yes, I've said it before, I'll say it again, I'm a "stamp snob."  For<br/>
me, it's all about the stamp image.  It's not, I repeat, it's not, about the<br/>
hike.<br/>
<br/>
I can go camping, hiking, climbing, etc. all I want without searching for a<br/>
box.  I don't need a box to "lure" me to a site.  It's the thrill of a<br/>
unique stamp image that lures me to follow a set of clues to the box at the<br/>
end.<br/>
<br/>
To me, the artwork is part of the sport.  Like playing baseball.  A person<br/>
can't decide they just want to bat and run but not get out in the field and<br/>
play defense.  It doesn't work like that.  It's a sport to me and a sport is<br/>
a total package.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I have absolutely no problem if people want to use<br/>
store-bought stamps.  I'd just ask them to pleasepleaseplease consider<br/>
putting that fact in the clues so that us stamp snobs can go merrily on our<br/>
way collecting the unique stamps elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Me, I'm strictly after unique one-of-a-kind stamp images.  They can be<br/>
hand-carved or they can be artwork done by the placer who then had them<br/>
turned into a stamp.  As long as it's unique, I'll goferit.<br/>
<br/>
But......<br/>
<br/>
I would not condone what the person you're talking about is doing.  If it's<br/>
not their box, they don't belong messin' with it.  If you don't like how a<br/>
placer does things, then just don't go looking for any more of their boxes<br/>
beyond the first one.<br/>
<br/>
It's like with card making.  I don't make flowery sunlighty cards.<br/>
Eeeeewwwww.  My cards tend to be on the Dark side.  The humor tends to be<br/>
rather black.  I even make humorous funeral cards.  It takes a special<br/>
family that commissions those.  So a lot of folks don't buy my cards.  I can<br/>
live with that.  And I'm sure the people who place boxes with store-bought<br/>
stamps can also live without me as a finder with no problem.  :-) To each<br/>
his or her own.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have that many boxes with store-bought stamps in your area?  *None*<br/>
of the boxes you found had unique stamps?<br/>
<br/>
Or look at it this way -- if we can have hitchhikers that take up<br/>
*temporary* residence, why not a *roommate* for the resident stamp?  How do<br/>
we really know that that store-bought teddy bear doesn't really want that<br/>
hand-carved clown as a roomie?  Stamps have right too y'know. Assuming a<br/>
totally platonic relationship, of course.  Separate ziploc baggies and all<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise the second placer darn well better leave some protection in that<br/>
box.  And if it's not platonic, the clues would have to label the box<br/>
X-rated and all that.  Which wouldn't be possible because, like with many<br/>
parents, the original placer would be in the dark about it all.  Eeewww, I'm<br/>
not liking this.....I was raised tootoo Catholic for this....I can't take<br/>
the mental image of tiny little teddy bears with bulb noses and size 22<br/>
shoes running around the box.<br/>
<br/>
When the placer comes along to check on the box, they can always "evict" the<br/>
roommate, eh?  Toss the roomie and it's belongings right out to the nearest<br/>
curb, or down the nearest scenic mountainside. You dun't kick in money for<br/>
rent an' food, you dun't live here nomo'.<br/>

In thinking about it I realize that I think that the people who use <br/>
store bought stamps don't really care, and the people that like <br/>
handcarved care alot, so maybe this is a good compromise. (If you <br/>
want something done your way, do it yourself.)<br/>
But I would be interested to hear what some non-carving types have <br/>
to say about it, since I am more of an art type than the hobby type <br/>

I'd have to agree with that.   It's like they're saying "You didn't do this <br/>
right, so I'm going to fix it for you whether you like it or not."<br/>
<br/>
One of my boxes has a store-bought stamp in it.   I chose that one purposely, <br/>
because it was the right image for the box and location and better than any <br/>
image I was able to find to carve.   It wasn't that I didn't bother to put the <br/>
effort into it, it was a conscious decision, and who is this "Mystery Placer" <br/>
to second guess my choice?   (Not that they are, since I'm nowhere near their <br/>
area, but you get the idea.<br/>

I'm sure their intentions were good, but I'd have to strongly disagree with <br/>
their actions.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to agree with the other replies to this.  It is an unsolicited <br/>
judgment on someone's effort, and it doesn't seem appropriate to <br/>
tamper with someone's box in this way (not to mention that it seems <br/>
somewhat mean-spirited).  Where does it end?  Additional stamps for <br/>
boxes with hand-carved stamps deemed "not artistic enough"?  <br/>
(Sensitive area for me as mine would definitely be in this class, <br/>
LOL.)  Finding new, better hiding places for boxes and posting <br/>
alternate clues?  <br/>
<br/>
As someone said, I think the effort would be better spent on creating <br/>
new boxes.  We like all aspects of lbing -- exploring unknown (to us) <br/>
places, being outside, and the thrill of the hunt.  Finding a hand-<br/>
carved stamp is icing on the cake for us, but enough of a treat that <br/>
we have only placed one box (a HH) that is not hand-carved, and that <br/>
one was very deliberately chosen based on our theme.  It would be <br/>
hurtful if someone felt compelled to "improve" on our effort by <br/>
adding a stamp of their own.  Just my two cents.<br/>

&gt; Me, yes, I've said it before, I'll say it again, I'm a "stamp <br/>
snob."  For<br/>
&gt; me, it's all about the stamp image.  It's not, I repeat, it's not, <br/>
about the<br/>
&gt; hike.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can go camping, hiking, climbing, etc. all I want without <br/>
searching for a<br/>
&gt; box.  I don't need a box to "lure" me to a site.  It's the thrill <br/>
of a<br/>
&gt; unique stamp image that lures me to follow a set of clues to the <br/>
box at the<br/>
&gt; end.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To me, the artwork is part of the sport.  Like playing baseball.  <br/>
A person<br/>
&gt; can't decide they just want to bat and run but not get out in the <br/>
field and<br/>
&gt; play defense.  It doesn't work like that.  It's a sport to me and <br/>
a sport is<br/>
&gt; a total package.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the other hand, I have absolutely no problem if people want to <br/>
use<br/>
&gt; store-bought stamps.  I'd just ask them to pleasepleaseplease <br/>
consider<br/>
&gt; putting that fact in the clues so that us stamp snobs can go <br/>
merrily on our<br/>
&gt; way collecting the unique stamps elsewhere.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Me, I'm strictly after unique one-of-a-kind stamp images.  They <br/>
can be<br/>
&gt; hand-carved or they can be artwork done by the placer who then had <br/>
them<br/>
&gt; turned into a stamp.  As long as it's unique, I'll goferit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But......<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would not condone what the person you're talking about is <br/>
doing.  If it's<br/>
&gt; not their box, they don't belong messin' with it.  If you don't <br/>
like how a<br/>
&gt; placer does things, then just don't go looking for any more of <br/>
their boxes<br/>
&gt; beyond the first one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's like with card making.  I don't make flowery sunlighty cards.<br/>
&gt; Eeeeewwwww.  My cards tend to be on the Dark side.  The humor <br/>
tends to be<br/>
&gt; rather black.  I even make humorous funeral cards.  It takes a <br/>
special<br/>
&gt; family that commissions those.  So a lot of folks don't buy my <br/>
cards.  I can<br/>
&gt; live with that.  And I'm sure the people who place boxes with <br/>
store-bought<br/>
&gt; stamps can also live without me as a finder with no problem.  :-) <br/>
To each<br/>
&gt; his or her own.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you have that many boxes with store-bought stamps in your <br/>
area?  *None*<br/>
&gt; of the boxes you found had unique stamps?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or look at it this way -- if we can have hitchhikers that take up<br/>
&gt; *temporary* residence, why not a *roommate* for the resident <br/>
stamp?  How do<br/>
&gt; we really know that that store-bought teddy bear doesn't really <br/>
want that<br/>
&gt; hand-carved clown as a roomie?  Stamps have right too y'know. <br/>
Assuming a<br/>
&gt; totally platonic relationship, of course.  Separate ziploc baggies <br/>
and all<br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Otherwise the second placer darn well better leave some protection <br/>
in that<br/>
&gt; box.  And if it's not platonic, the clues would have to label the <br/>
box<br/>
&gt; X-rated and all that.  Which wouldn't be possible because, like <br/>
with many<br/>
&gt; parents, the original placer would be in the dark about it all.  <br/>
Eeewww, I'm<br/>
&gt; not liking this.....I was raised tootoo Catholic for this....I <br/>
can't take<br/>
&gt; the mental image of tiny little teddy bears with bulb noses and <br/>
size 22<br/>
&gt; shoes running around the box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When the placer comes along to check on the box, they can <br/>
always "evict" the<br/>
&gt; roommate, eh?  Toss the roomie and it's belongings right out to <br/>
the nearest<br/>
&gt; curb, or down the nearest scenic mountainside. You dun't kick in <br/>
money for<br/>
&gt; rent an' food, you dun't live here nomo'.<br/>

I'd love to know which boxes you found these in, in case you've visited some that I <br/>

<br/>
Is this only in the Portland, OR area? Has this been happening in<br/>
other places? Personally, I think I'd be irritated with that. Many of<br/>
my boxes are a tight fit in the box due to the small container size<br/>
and/or limited space due to the logbook. Many of my boxes are unable<br/>
to accomodate hitchhikers for this reason. I have seen different ways<br/>
of dealing with this, but in short - I would personally be inclined to<br/>
remove this "mystery placer's" contribution and turn it either into a<br/>
hitchhiker or better yet - leave it in the nearest Geocache!<br/>

There's no need to start stirring the boiling pot folks. This has been<br/>
hashed, and I can say that there isn't a formal, written rule about<br/>
placing another stamp in a box - just as there isn't one against<br/>
hitchhikers - but I'll be darned if I have to go to more effort to<br/>
write more info on each and every 100 some odd clues aboup14t the size<br/>
of the container being unable to accomodate either a hitchhiker or<br/>
someone else's trash.<br/>
<br/>
As for this persons reply, this really has nothing to do with<br/>
non-carving ability. This is addressing the fact that someone is<br/>
placing an additional item in their original box.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a Geocaching mentality to me. <br/>

That's a pity that this person feels obligated to tamper with other<br/>
boxers creations. It's a box, take it or leave it. Find it or avoid<br/>
it, but don't try and destroy what someone else took the time to<br/>
create. No matter what your opinion is on hand carved stamps, I feel<br/>
it is sort of sacred when someone goes to the time and effort to<br/>
create a box and place it in an area with the intention of sharing a<br/>
place or memory that is important to them. I really honor people that<br/>
take the time to place boxes...these days I have less and less respect<br/>
for careless un-appreciative finders.<br/>

Even if the mystery placer thinks they are doing this in "good fun"or somehow making an improvement, I think it is utterly inappropriate...it's like touching up someone's painting because you think it needs something a bit extra. It's incredibly disrespectful. You don't know what the placer's intent was when choosing that stamp. I carve most of my own stamps, but I have purposely chosen store bought stamps for a couple of mine, to give a certain impression or sentiment or feeling.<br/>
<br/>
I treat boxes like the placer's own artwork. It is their expression of a certain place or feeling or remembrance, and it is not for anyone to decide to change that...and in that sense, I don't think this mystery placer should waste their artwork by putting it in someone else's box - risking disposal at the hands of an irate placer.<br/>

No, you're right.   That doesn't sound playful at all.   So much for the <br/>
benefit of the doubt.<br/>
<br/>
It's in the same category as the stories I've heard about people changing the <br/>
mounting on someone's hitchhiker stamp, or repackaging a box (unless it's <br/>
required to prevent leakage) or hitchhiker.   Tampering.   Intrusive. <br/>
Presumptuous. And rather mean-spirited to try to make someone feel badly about a box they <br/>
put effort into, to put out there for the rest of us to find!<br/>

I believe one of the appealing things to "stamp snobs" is that the unique, hand-carved stamps place an imprint in their book that can't be obtained anywhere else.  It is a symbol of their time and effort to go seek that letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
If the prize is an imprint that can ALSO be obtained by heading to the nearest Hobby Lobby and browsing the shelves, it doesn't carry the same "mystique".<br/>
<br/>
This is just my opinion.  There is certainly nothing wrong store-bought stamps and I don't think anyone was trying to insult anyone's ability to carve a stamp.  Its just a desire to behold something unique and crafted by hand which can't be found anywhere else.  <br/>
<br/>
Its the "treasure" at the end of the hunt.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...my two cents.<br/>

<br/>
When it comes to messing with someone's box, you can<br/>
never go wrong by asking permission if you want to do<br/>
something unconventional.  That way the placer has the<br/>
opportunity to express their concerns or make whatever<br/>
other thoughts they have about their boxes known.  <br/>
<br/>
I'll never forget finding one of Baby Bear's boxes on<br/>
our first outing and spotting a great hiding place for<br/>
a box that would tie in with his in the same park.  I<br/>
wrote him an email asking if I could place clues to<br/>
such a box in his box and he very graciously agreed,<br/>
and went on to explain to me that I was describing a<br/>
bonus box.  I never went through with it (was a little<br/>
overzealous at the time and had to settle in a bit,<br/>
though I didn't realize it then!).  Still though, as<br/>
nice a guy as he is, I just don't think he would've<br/>
cared much for me just sticking some clues in his box.<br/>

If you're trying to be nice, it never hurts to ask!<br/>

No one mentioned anything about this, but that's not really a very<br/>
good anology. A painting is an original, creative work and<br/>
store-bought stamps don't fit that category. At best, it's like<br/>
someone adding a painting because they didn't like the print that<br/>
someone left behind. And it could have been worse--the perp could have<br/>
destroyed the original store-bought stamp. At least they're leaving it<br/>
behind and the owner of the box, if they choose, can easily remove the<br/>
newly added stamp if they find it offensive.<br/>
<br/>
All-in-all, I'd rank this crime as fairly petty and one not worthy of<br/>
deep thought. I'd be more concerned about geocachers that take the<br/>
original stamp by accident or whoever it was that claimed to be<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Exactly.  To me, it's the uniqueness.<br/>
<br/>
A mediocre hand carved stamp or a mediocre personally designed stamp is<br/>
better than the most beautiful of store-bought stamps.<br/>
<br/>
We have a placer in this neck of the woods who draws/designs his own stamps<br/>
and then has a stamp company make a stamp of his drawing/design for him.  If<br/>
a person mounts the stamp themself, it's pretty darn cheap to do.  And a<br/>
person can order an entire sheet and make it even cheaper.  It's still an<br/>
"original" stamp.  And to me, it's still precious.  It's unique.  I've done<br/>
a couple of these so far that way for boxes when a heavy-duty amount of<br/>
letters was involved.  Whoever finds those boxes is still getting a<br/>
one-of-a-kind stamp.  And I try to have more than one box at those sites so<br/>
that there is a hand-carved stamp to find.<br/>
<br/>
However, I also put the type of stamp in the clues so that somebody who<br/>
doesn't like that style can by-pass that box.  Since there *are* so many<br/>
varieties to this game/sport/hobby, I feel that's just a courteous thing to<br/>
do.  On the other hand, no, there's certainly no requirement to do it.  But<br/>
there's also no requirement saying I can't get hot under the collar when I<br/>
spend a lot of time and gas money and find a stamp I already own at the end<br/>
of my search.  :-) At $2.60 a gallon, I can't afford to go after every box<br/>
in captivity anymore.  And with a full-time job and a part-time job, as I'm<br/>
getting close to retirement, I also have to be kind of selective because I<br/>
don't have the time available to go after every box in captivity anymore.  I<br/>
wish.  Oh, how I wish.<br/>
<br/>
But is it really that hard to note the type of stamp in the clues so that<br/>
people can pick and choose what would be most enjoyable for *them*?  Could<br/>
*that* be what's frustrating to this "Mystery Placer"?<br/>

I believe one of the appealing things to "stamp snobs" is that the unique,<br/>
hand-carved stamps place an imprint in their book that can't be obtained<br/>
anywhere else.  It is a symbol of their time and effort to go seek that<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
If the prize is an imprint that can ALSO be obtained by heading to the<br/>
nearest Hobby Lobby and browsing the shelves, it doesn't carry the same<br/>
"mystique".<br/>

it mean spirited. Now that being said, I came up with a great idea. I<br/>
currently have 150+ boxes placed. None of them have store bought stamps in<br/>
them, but I'm certain if this mystery placer needs something to do with<br/>
their time I can put out say 40 or 50 this weekend that all have store<br/>
bought stamps in them so that this Mystery Placer has something to do with<br/>
their time this next week or two. Better start carving Mystery Placer!<br/>

Personally, my original attraction to letterboxing was that it's not the same kind of artform as painting, sculpting, printmaking, or something like that where the artist does the work in solitude and then it is placed in a gallery for people to look at. Letterboxing is a form of communication. It is an interactive art form, very similar to the Fluxus art movement of the sixties. The work is never complete... it is always waiting for someone to make it more interesting.<br/>
<br/>
When I create a box and plant it, I know that I have only performed the first act of what will hopefully be a long cycle of creative interactions with an imaginative and thoughtful community. My letterbox will change every time someone visits it. Sometimes it will change in small subtle ways. Sometimes it will change in big dramatic ways. My only hope is that the box doesn't disappear completely.  It's all part of the game.  If this concept is too much for someone to handle, I suggest that they should consider finding another medium in which to express their creativity... one that involves hanging their precious artwork in a gallery behind a velvet rope fence.<br/>

Okay, if I may (so that I may understand)...I am going to word this in a<br/>
certain way, because I am reading two different things as I read your<br/>
response and this is in no way meant to sound disrespectful or sarcastic<br/>
(though I know it may be read that way), but instead meant to help me<br/>
understand what I read as inconsistencies. Bear with me...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<it and="" arguments="" bickering="" in<br="" many="" me="" occur="" of="" seems="" so="" that="" the="" to="">
letterboxing are the result of people's inability to "let go" of their boxes<br/>

a letterbox and plant it, I consider it to be a gift to the community.  The<br/>
community decides if my box succeeds or fails and if it becomes a legend or<br/>
a flash in the pan.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
...does that mean that once you plant your "gift" that you don't go back and<br/>
tend to it and take responsibility for having placed it in the first<br/>
place?...or do you expect the "community" to care for your box?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<if a="" add="" any<br="" boxes,="" embellish="" in="" it="" my="" of="" one="" or="" someone="" stamp="" to="" wants="">

which the community has chosen to interact with my box. I would be flattered<br/>
to find that someone had added a bonus stamp to one of my letterboxes.<br/>
(Please do... please, please, please!)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So if someone decided that the continued existence of YOUR letterbox (that<br/>
you have given to the community) involved taking out all the contents and<br/>
replacing them with their own stamp and log (essentially usurping your clues<br/>
and hiding place), how would that rate in your opinion?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<personally, attraction="" it's="" letterboxing="" my="" not="" original="" that="" the<br="" to="" was="">

that where the artist does the work in solitude and then it is placed in a<br/>
gallery for people to look at.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you that this is not an artform meant to be 'hands-off'...after<br/>
all the use of the stamp involves choice of color, placement or whether you<br/>
want the stamp in your log in the first place. I however, see the WHOLE<br/>
letterbox as the art that the person creates. When you add or subtract from<br/>
the original, you change the experience of the finder.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<letterboxing a="" communication.="" form="" is="" of="">&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I also agree with you that letterboxing is a form of communication. This is<br/>
the very reason that the idea of someone changing a letterbox of mine, makes<br/>
me angry. I don't want someone else to change my original thought or message<br/>
or sentiment -- in effect negating that I had a message in the first place.<br/>
For example, I launched a hitchhiker in memory of my late husband in the<br/>
image of his bright green and black truck that he was known for. If someone<br/>
decided to change the color of the ink markers or change the stamp itself,<br/>
it would fundamentally change and diminish the meaning I intended. It would<br/>
be fine if they wanted to stamp it in THEIR log in a different color,<br/>
creating meaning for themselves, but it's not for them to say if the ink I<br/>
put in there should be taken out or that other colors should be added.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<when a="" and="" box="" create="" have="" i="" it,="" know="" only="" performed="" plant="" that="" the<br="">

Sometimes it will change in big dramatic ways. My only hope is that the box<br/>
doesn't disappear completely.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I, too, hope that there will be plenty of creative interactions with my<br/>
letterboxes such as poems, riddles, pictures and such, but I have a hard<br/>
time believing that you would not be upset if someone fundamentally changed<br/>
your box. If you place a box with a stamp image of bird and a special<br/>
feather covered log and them someone adds a stamp of a gun with a message of<br/>
'killing' your bird, wouldn't you think that was out of line? I know that is<br/>
a hypothetical example, but I wouldn't put it past someone with a twisted<br/>
idea of what is funny.<br/>

I don't think changing other's boxes is "part of the game"...and I don't<br/>
think most people go into the act of placing a box thinking that that is<br/>
part of the bargain.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize if I have come across in the wrong way. I just think the idea of<br/>
changing someone's box in any way (except maybe adding a plastic baggie to<br/>
protect the stamp or log when the original bag is ripped) is just downright<br/>
disrespectful. Perhaps others feel more free about their boxes, but in<br/>
consideration of those who are not so generous of spirit, myself included, I<br/>
don't think these practices should be condoned.<br/>

I won't presume to speak for DMS, but my take on what he said was a bit <br/>
more benign. I read it more along the lines of "If you just can't stand <br/>
people messing with your box or the possibility of it going missing or <br/>
some such, then maybe this hobby isn't for you." While I would never <br/>
mess with anyone else's LB, I agree to the extent that if such things <br/>
like that are going to get your blood pressure to uncomfortable <br/>
heights, you might want to reconsider. We don't have to like it and <br/>
it's not like we can't say anything when it happens and even discuss <br/>
the 'appropriateness' of various actions, but boxes **will** be messed <br/>
with and/or destroyed. It's not pleasant, but it's going to happen. <br/>
When a box I plant goes missing, I'll be upset, but will have to make <br/>
that a temporary state or the hobby will quickly become more <br/>
aggravating than fun, which I<br/>
don't want. :-)<br/>

No, DMS is touching upon the artsnob stampsnob world. The holier than<br/>
thou elitist mentality that we all disdain.  All art is up for grabs,<br/>
everything has been done, redone, born again, reborn and not your own.<br/>
The earth, is not your own, you wanna talk sixties? I suggest that you<br/>
do a little more homework on that discussion.<br/>
<br/>
As for letterboxing, sure, it could be viewed as a cultural experiment<br/>
into the relationships between people and plastic.<br/>
<br/>
I put my art out there.<br/>
If you don't like it, don't find it.<br/>

I view letterboxes that I place as a social event, as<br/>
an evolving art project that I release into the wild<br/>
and turn over to fortune. <br/>
<br/>
It's so fascinating how people have joined together to<br/>
mysteriously find, share and create art. It's an<br/>
intriguing social event that melds art with nature and<br/>
our environment, and connects us in this unique way. <br/>
<br/>
It's probably best to let go of feelings of territory<br/>
and simply let the experience develop.<br/>

---------------------------------<br/>
It seems to me that so many of the arguments and<br/>
bickering that occur in letterboxing are the result of<br/>
people's inability to "let go" of their boxes and turn<br/>
them over to the community. They want to maintain<br/>
total control over what happens to the box and the<br/>
territory surrounding it. When I create a letterbox<br/>
and plant it, I consider it to be a gift to the<br/>
community.  The community decides if my box succeeds<br/>
or fails and if it becomes a legend or a flash in the<br/>
pan.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to add a stamp to one of my boxes, or<br/>
embellish it in any other way that suits their fancy,<br/>
that's just fine with me.  In fact, I would welcome<br/>
such activity, as long as it doesn't jeaopordize the<br/>
continued existence of my letterbox.  I see such<br/>
actions as just another method in which the community<br/>
has chosen to interact with my box. I would be<br/>
flattered to find that someone had added a bonus stamp<br/>
to one of my letterboxes.  (Please do... please,<br/>
please, please!)<br/>
<br/>
Personally, my original attraction to letterboxing was<br/>
that it's not the same kind of artform as painting,<br/>
sculpting, printmaking, or something like that where<br/>
the artist does the work in solitude and then it is<br/>
placed in a gallery for people to look at.<br/>
Letterboxing is a form of communication. It is an<br/>
interactive art form, very similar to the Fluxus art<br/>
movement of the sixties. The work is never complete...<br/>
it is always waiting for someone to make it more<br/>
interesting.<br/>
<br/>
When I create a box and plant it, I know that I have<br/>
only performed the first act of what will hopefully be<br/>
a long cycle of creative interactions with an<br/>
imaginative and thoughtful community. My letterbox<br/>
will change every time someone visits it. Sometimes it<br/>
will change in small subtle ways. Sometimes it will<br/>
change in big dramatic ways. My only hope is that the<br/>
box doesn't disappear completely.  It's all part of<br/>
the game.  If this concept is too much for someone to<br/>
handle, I suggest that they should consider finding<br/>
another medium in which to express their creativity...<br/>
one that involves hanging their precious artwork in a<br/>
gallery behind a velvet rope fence.<br/>

<br/>
Whew! I'm glad to see that some people understood what I was trying <br/>
to say about this topic.  For those others who read my words and <br/>
decided to dismiss me as an elitist art snob or think that I'm saying <br/>
people must agree with my opinions or find another hobby, all I can <br/>
say is that I'm sorry that my words did not adequately express my <br/>
true feelings.<br/>
<br/>
I'm really not an art snob. Nor do I claim to be an expert in art <br/>
trends of the sixties. All I said was that I like the fact that <br/>
letterboxing is an interactive artform. I don't believe that <br/>
letterboxes need to have hand-carved stamps, although I must admit <br/>
that I tend to prefer stamps that have been manufactured from an <br/>
original design over ones that were bought off a shelf.  But I have <br/>
no aversion to letterboxes that contain store-bought stamps.  I can <br/>
think of quite a few that I knew were that type of box before I went <br/>
hunting for them. That didn't stop me from solving the clues, finding <br/>
the boxes, and happily stamping them into my logbook. <br/>
<br/>
I actually have an obsessive fetish for rubber stamps... ALL rubber <br/>
stamps.  I have planted boxes with store-bought stamps in them <br/>
myself, although they were somewhat altered so as to be truly <br/>
unique.  Anyone who has spent any time at all communicating with me <br/>
knows that I am anything but an elitist or an art snob.<br/>
<br/>
Please understand that I'm not specifically condoning the actions of <br/>
the Mystery Placer. I can certainly see why some people would <br/>
consider this person's actions to be thoughtless or rude. I'm simply <br/>
saying that I, personally, would not be upset if this person added a <br/>
bonus stamp to one of my boxes.<br/>
<br/>
It is not just my opinion that things happen to our boxes that we <br/>
didn't originally intend to happen, it is a fact.  That is the nature <br/>
of our hobby. We leave our works of art in the wild and subject them <br/>
to the world.  Sometimes we can't anticipate what will become of it <br/>
after that.  Sometimes they go missing altogether.  In a way, that <br/>
actually adds to the intrigue of the game, because you never really <br/>
know if the box you're looking for still exists or not.  When you <br/>
find it, part of the excitement is in knowing that it is still alive.<br/>
<br/>
So I'm not saying that you must agree with my OPINION or go find <br/>
another hobby.  I'm just saying that if you can't accept the FACT <br/>
that unforseen things may happen to your box, then maybe this isn't <br/>
the best hobby for you.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also not saying that I believe in planting boxes and abandoning <br/>
them.  I was forced to lose touch with my boxes for a period of time <br/>
because of drastic circumstances in my personal life.  But as soon as <br/>
I was able, I made the rounds and performed maintenance on all my <br/>
boxes.  In the case of the few that were planted too far away from <br/>
home to visit, I have done my best to contact people who live in that <br/>
area or who had recently visited my boxes to determine their current <br/>
status, and I have updated all my clues to reflect that status.<br/>
<br/>
If someone takes the contents out of my box and replaces them with <br/>
something else, then they have done a disservice to the letterboxing <br/>
community.  Obviously, I would not be in favor of that.  But if <br/>
somebody just ADDS something to my box, I'm not going to have a cow <br/>
about it.  If I made a box with a bird in it, and someone added a <br/>
stamp of a gun to shoot the bird with, I would laugh out loud!  I <br/>
would repeat the hike just to go get a print of the gun!<br/>
<br/>
And if someone puts something in my box that I really don't want to <br/>
be there, I reserve the right to take it out again.  I'm not going to <br/>
get angry about it, though.  Perhaps I would just convert it into a <br/>
hitchhiker, unless it was something really offensive.  But, in most <br/>
cases, whenever someone drops something new and interesting into one <br/>
of my letterboxes, I leave it there for others to see.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I apologize if my early post did not properly express my <br/>
feelings.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I appreciate your clarification. Thanks for taking the time to write it out.<br/>
I just felt like your previous post was expressing conflicting sentiments<br/>
and I wasn't sure where you were 'coming from'.<br/>
<br/>
While I don't agree with people deciding to alter other's boxes, I'm glad to<br/>
see that we agree that placers ultimately have proprietary rights and<br/>
responsibilities regarding their boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
Be well!<br/>

&gt;&gt; No, DMS is touching upon the artsnob stampsnob world. The holier<br/>
than thou elitist mentality that we all disdain. All art is up for<br/>
grabs, everything has been done, redone, born again, reborn and not<br/>
your own. The earth, is not your own, you wanna talk sixties? I<br/>
suggest that you do a little more homework on that discussion. &lt;&lt;<br/>

Whew! I'm glad to see that some people understood what I was trying<br/>
to say about this topic.  For those others who read my words and<br/>
decided to dismiss me as an elitist art snob or think that I'm saying<br/>
people must agree with my opinions or find another hobby, all I can<br/>
say is that I'm sorry that my words did not adequately express my<br/>
true feelings.<br/>
<br/>
I'm really not an art snob. Nor do I claim to be an expert in art<br/>
trends of the sixties. All I said was that I like the fact that<br/>
letterboxing is an interactive artform. I don't believe that<br/>
letterboxes need to have hand-carved stamps, although I must admit<br/>
that I tend to prefer stamps that have been manufactured from an<br/>
original design over ones that were bought off a shelf.  But I have<br/>
no aversion to letterboxes that contain store-bought stamps.  I can<br/>
think of quite a few that I knew were that type of box before I went<br/>
hunting for them. That didn't stop me from solving the clues, finding<br/>
the boxes, and happily stamping them into my logbook.<br/>
<br/>
I actually have an obsessive fetish for rubber stamps... ALL rubber<br/>
stamps.  I have planted boxes with store-bought stamps in them<br/>
myself, although they were somewhat altered so as to be truly<br/>
unique.  Anyone who has spent any time at all communicating with me<br/>
knows that I am anything but an elitist or an art snob.<br/>
<br/>
Please understand that I'm not specifically condoning the actions of<br/>
the Mystery Placer. I can certainly see why some people would<br/>
consider this person's actions to be thoughtless or rude. I'm simply<br/>
saying that I, personally, would not be upset if this person added a<br/>
bonus stamp to one of my boxes.<br/>
<br/>
It is not just my opinion that things happen to our boxes that we<br/>
didn't originally intend to happen, it is a fact.  That is the nature<br/>
of our hobby. We leave our works of art in the wild and subject them<br/>
to the world.  Sometimes we can't anticipate what will become of it<br/>
after that.  Sometimes they go missing altogether.  In a way, that<br/>
actually adds to the intrigue of the game, because you never really<br/>
know if the box you're looking for still exists or not.  When you<br/>
find it, part of the excitement is in knowing that it is still alive.<br/>
<br/>
So I'm not saying that you must agree with my OPINION or go find<br/>
another hobby.  I'm just saying that if you can't accept the FACT<br/>
that unforseen things may happen to your box, then maybe this isn't<br/>
the best hobby for you.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also not saying that I believe in planting boxes and abandoning<br/>
them.  I was forced to lose touch with my boxes for a period of time<br/>
because of drastic circumstances in my personal life.  But as soon as<br/>
I was able, I made the rounds and performed maintenance on all my<br/>
boxes.  In the case of the few that were planted too far away from<br/>
home to visit, I have done my best to contact people who live in that<br/>
area or who had recently visited my boxes to determine their current<br/>
status, and I have updated all my clues to reflect that status.<br/>
<br/>
If someone takes the contents out of my box and replaces them with<br/>
something else, then they have done a disservice to the letterboxing<br/>
community.  Obviously, I would not be in favor of that.  But if<br/>
somebody just ADDS something to my box, I'm not going to have a cow<br/>
about it.  If I made a box with a bird in it, and someone added a<br/>
stamp of a gun to shoot the bird with, I would laugh out loud!  I<br/>
would repeat the hike just to go get a print of the gun!<br/>
<br/>
And if someone puts something in my box that I really don't want to<br/>
be there, I reserve the right to take it out again.  I'm not going to<br/>
get angry about it, though.  Perhaps I would just convert it into a<br/>
hitchhiker, unless it was something really offensive.  But, in most<br/>
cases, whenever someone drops something new and interesting into one<br/>
of my letterboxes, I leave it there for others to see.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I apologize if my early post did not properly express my<br/>
feelings.<br/>
