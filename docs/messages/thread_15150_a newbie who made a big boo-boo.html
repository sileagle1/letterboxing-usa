                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!  This'll be part introduction, part apology, and part plea for help!<br/>
<br/>
I'm Debbie, and I'm brand new to letterboxing.  I learned about it two weeks <br/>
ago, right before I left on vacation, so I spent my vacation time finding <br/>
letterboxes all along the route.  I was doing great right up to the ninth one I <br/>
found, and the last one on the way home.<br/>
<br/>
This morning, I went to find another one, right here at home, and I <br/>
discovered I still have the stamp from the Celebration Letterbox in Orlando in my bag!  <br/>
I feel just terrible!  That's the apology part.  I'm SO sorry!<br/>
<br/>
I'm not due to be in Orlando again until October, which brings me to the plea <br/>
for help.  Is there any kind letterboxer out there who lives in the Orlando <br/>
area who would allow me to mail them the stamp, and who would be so good as to <br/>
put it back for me????  I'd be so grateful!<br/>
<br/>
Debbie, who's not USUALLY that scatterbrained!<br/>
