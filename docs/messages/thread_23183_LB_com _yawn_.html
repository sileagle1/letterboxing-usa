                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oooh, maybe 4 or 5 years ago I got my undies in a bundle reading scary posts on this list about "geo-trashers."  I was all ready to take umbrage.<br/>
<br/>
  Then one day, I got an email from Amanda from Seattle, asking if I'd be willing to adopt the letterbox at Max Patch, as a geocacher had mistaken it for a cache, took the stamp and left a little wallet thingy.<br/>
<br/>
  I did, and carved a stamp which speaks to the history of Max Patch, replacing the little commercial sunburst logo that had been in the box.  So, a cacher unwittingly improved letterboxing a wee bit, and I have the honor of maintaining one of the first US boxes.<br/>
<br/>
  Since then, I've found caches near my other boxes, and cachers have found my boxes, signed in, and sometimes left cute little things, and not one has yet stolen a stamp.<br/>
<br/>
  I am a Luddite at heart; I care not for most electronics, and wouldn't geocache if you paid me.  I love the "feel" of the LbNA website, and it fills my 'boxing needs.  I won't get my undies in a bundle if somebody wants to go somewhere else.<br/>

I believe the 'proper' letterboxing terminology is getting <br/>
one's "knickers in a twist".<br/>
