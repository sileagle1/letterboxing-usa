<p>For those who have never seen it, the <a href="http://www.stormkingartcenter.org/"><u>Storm King Art 
Center</u></a> is well worth the visit. Colossal sculpture by the worlds 
finest artists are displayed amidst a stunning outdoor setting that enhances 
their beauty. Some of the pieces were created specifically for the sculpture 
park. Click on the link above to find out more about this treasure in the Hudson 
Valley.</p>

<p>King’s Ritual</p>
<p>You trajectory will take you beyond Orbit on a downward sloping path. On the 
right you will find the needle. Look through its eye to a tree. Beyond this tree 
continue about 30 paces due north to another. From there it is 9 paces NW to 
another that reminds you of the King’s Ritual. Look on the ground to the left of 
this tree. </p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>This place is a museum and all objects must be treated with respect as well 
as the grounds and landscape. Please be very discreet while hunting and stamping 
up. No boxes are located at the sculptures themselves.</p>
<p>The piece for which this box is named may have been moved shortly after its 
placement, in which case revised clues will be forthcoming.</p>
<p>***************************************</p>
<p>Peace Mother</p>
<p>The Peace Sign points to a copse of birches where you will find a large flat 
rock behind some bushes at its near point. Standing on this rock with the 
pointer at your left shoulder, descend to the ground and find her resting place, 
six feet away under a smaller flat rock. </p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>This place is a museum and all objects must be treated with respect as well 
as the grounds and landscape. Please be very discreet while hunting and stamping 
up. No boxes are located at the sculptures themselves.</p>
<p>***************************************</p>
<p>Black Flag</p>
<p>The Black Flag points down hill to a solitary tree. Enter the woods beyond it 
about 25 feet and come to a pathway. Follow this to the right looking for a 
culvert on your left. From the culvert it is 90 paces to a small tree just to 
the left of the path that has grown up through a split rock. See what the 
chipmunks have hidden there.</p>

as the grounds and landscape. Please be very discreet while hunting and stamping 
up. No boxes are located at the sculptures themselves.</p>
<p>A three year exhibition of Calder’s work went on display in May 2001. This 
box will expire when it is over.</p>
