&gt;  I would send clues (or their links) to the list.  I am going to be<br/>
&gt;  trying to help Dan do the clues (and perhaps others who expressed<br/>
&gt;  interest in working with the maps will too someday), so it will be<br/>
&gt;  easier for us if they are sent to the list without needing to remember<br/>
&gt;  who is working on them.  Also, in the very unlikely event that we are<br/>
&gt;  slow getting them up:-), we won't be a bottleneck in getting the clues.<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  Send them to the list for now.  Thank you for helping Randy.<br/>
I appreciate it.  Perhaps it would make sense to send them to<br/>
mailto:letterbox-technical@egroups.com<br/>
at some point.  This would get them to people with technical skills.<br/>
We could put a link to it on the main page "Submit clues here" or<br/>
something like that?  It could always be replaced later on with a form<br/>
if we get one.  BTW, a friend of mine has a form that all it does is<br/>
submit a pre-formatted email message.  Its at<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/access/page8.html<br/>
Perhaps if we did something like that we would have it go to the<br/>
list and then somebody could flag it to let others know they are<br/>
putting it up.<br/>
Just thinking out loud...<br/>
Again, thanks Randy and everyone else who has offered to help.<br/>

BARTLETT BROOK LETTERBOX<br/>
placed August 18, 2000<br/>
<br/>
Bartlett Brook is a Wildlife Management Area (WMA) located in Lebanon, CT.<br/>
675 acres of hardwood forest mixed with hardwood swamp and some grasslands.<br/>
Beaver Brook and Exeter Brook are some of the habitat features. Todays<br/>
hike can be short or long depending on your preference. The terrain is<br/>
pretty flat, although there are some slight uphill and downhill parts. At<br/>
minimum, it is just over 2 miles out and back. The longer hike can be<br/>
anywhere from 3 to 5 miles depending on what you want to do. There are some<br/>
hardwood swamps, so expect to make detours here and there around the<br/>
"puddles", depending on the season.<br/>
<br/>
	Access can be found on Goshen Hill Rd about  of a mile east of Route 16.<br/>
Goshen Hill Rd is the last right turn coming from Colchester before Route<br/>
16 ends at Route 207. There is a sign that directs you to an ample parking<br/>
area. Please remember to wear orange between October and March. After<br/>
parking, enter the main trail behind another State sign in the SW corner of<br/>
the parking area. The main trails are wide enough to bicycle, x-ski, or<br/>
horseback ride on. Go straight and follow the main trail down past a<br/>
cornfield on the right, heading generally SW through heavy woods. After a<br/>
while it becomes a gradual incline, not steep though. Stone walls on both<br/>
sides escort you pretty much all the way on this main trail. Eventually the<br/>
main trail curves to the left and passes through a field (Grasshopper<br/>
Heaven is what my son calls it). However, a smaller trail does continue<br/>
straight at this curve. This part was impassable when we planted the box.<br/>
It may not be when you go out. In that case continue straight and ignore<br/>
the next set of instructions. Follow the main trail into the field and take<br/>
your first right onto a smaller trail going in a SW direction again. Follow<br/>
this down until it curves to the right and hooks up with the straight line<br/>
trail you might have taken in drier conditions and continue to head SW into<br/>
heavy woods again. You may have to skirt around some smaller puddles ahead.<br/>
Pretty quickly youll arrive at Bartlett Brook, and the bridge over<br/>
peaceful waters. We sat here and fished off the bridge for a bit. I caught<br/>
a yearling trout, which we released. A beaver dam is right below you on the<br/>
right side of the bridge. Continue past the brook up a slight incline, the<br/>
stone walls still escorting you. After you reach the top, youll find a big<br/>
(not huge) pine tree on the right. Across from that pine tree, on your<br/>
left, youll need to bushwhack through about 10 yards to find an old<br/>
foundation. Climb down the broken steps (careful!) and turn right to locate<br/>
your prize down low and right, in the inner foundation wall. Stamp up and<br/>
return.<br/>
<br/>
You may either return the way you came, or continue the hike around the<br/>
main trail loop. If you choose to continue, when you get back to the main<br/>
trail, turn right and continue on the loop. Soon, youll reach a point<br/>
where you have to turn left or right. Left is the way out. Right leads you<br/>
down to Exeter Brook. This is a very picturesque area. Or, you can go<br/>
straight through the brush and find a sluice gate and sluiceway. Return to<br/>
the main trail and follow it. Soon youll reach a fork. Right finishes the<br/>
loop and brings you back to your car. Left takes you past a vernal pool.<br/>
