<br/>
I caught your message about checking our clues, and our "Vernon-Rails <br/>
to Trails" box is listed on the What's New page, but missing from the <br/>
Eastern Connecticut Clues page.  I also had a problem sending out <br/>
the "Barrel of Monkeys and Holy Cow... What a View!" clues.  Some of <br/>
the text got garbled, so I re-sent it as an attachment, which seemed <br/>
to work better.  (The garbled message was #8413, and the good one was <br/>
#8414).  I noticed that the garbled clues were the ones you posted to <br/>
both the What's New and the Western CT Clues pages.  Could you please <br/>
fix that, since the title of the box really is "Holy Cow... What a <br/>
View!" not just "What a View!" (If you find the box, once you see the <br/>
stamp it will all make sense.  But I don't want to give alway all the <br/>
fun!)  Sorry to give you more work to do, you do a great job keeping <br/>
up with everything.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
