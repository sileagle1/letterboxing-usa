<br/>
As many other non aggressive letterboxers have recently, I too am <br/>
leaving the list.  After 4+ Digests a day of constant name calling, <br/>
complaining and down right nastiness, I've decided that I can do <br/>
something about it and leave.  While I have silently read each and <br/>
every post, taken many letterboxing suggestions to heart, and hiked <br/>
in my own "pagan/hippie" way, I've gotten sadder and sadder about the <br/>
mutual disrespect many people have displayed.<br/>
<br/>
This activity/hobby/fun loving lifestyle is marred by those who are <br/>
competitive in such a nasty way.  At one time I looked forward to <br/>
reading people's adventures and excitement about new boxes.  Now <br/>
reading the list is just a drag on my day.  So ... in the spirit of <br/>
Yule and being thankful for what I've got ... I'm not going to take <br/>
it any more.  I'll be in the RMLetterboxing list.  It's much more fun <br/>
and friendly.<br/>
<br/>
Ciao<br/>
Phoenix<br/>
