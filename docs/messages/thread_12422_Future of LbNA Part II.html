on the new website:<br/>
<br/>
LbNA is changing over to a new, more user-friendly format where <br/>
letterboxers can enter and maintain their own boxes. Please take a <br/>
moment to surf around at:<br/>
<br/>
http://letterboxing.wesgarrison.us<br/>
<br/>
For the next several weeks we will be encouraging everyone to add <br/>
their own boxes to the new website (there have been over 1000 boxes <br/>
entered so far).<br/>
<br/>
-Go to the Member Services area and create an account for yourself.<br/>
-Click "add a box" and type in the info so people can go a-lookin' <br/>
for your creations.<br/>
-If you don't have your clue text handy, you can cut and paste it <br/>
from the old site at www.letterboxing.org.<br/>
-The webmasters have been busily adding boxes to the new site as <br/>
well. If you notice that one of your boxes is already up and that the <br/>
info on it says it was done by the webmasters, you can email us and <br/>
we'll change it over to give you ownership. Just email <br/>
<br/>
wes-at-wesgarrison-dot-us<br/>
or<br/>
webmasters-at-letterboxing-dot-org<br/>
<br/>
and we'll "give your box back." We've tried to do this only for a few <br/>
boxes to get things going: it would be much better if everyone could <br/>
take care of this massive chore themselves.<br/>
<br/>
In about one month, when we're sure that no letterboxes get lost or <br/>
left behind, we will redirect the official letterboxing.org domain to <br/>
the new site.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy! Jay in CT<br/>
