Back from the Pacific Northwest doing our local box check, we noticed<br/>
that the access to the Carolina South box was becoming overgrown with<br/>
poison ivy.  (Guess this is why it?s always a good thing to keep<br/>
rechecking boxes planted early in the season!)  The box has been<br/>
relocated to a spot across from the faded white picket fence cemetery,<br/>
about 6 steps in along the east side of the south-tending stone wall,<br/>
as noted in our revised clues.  We also wanted to point out that the<br/>
Grass Pond box clues have been posted on our web page for well over a<br/>
month now, and clues for other boxes already planted should be coming<br/>
out soon!<br/>
