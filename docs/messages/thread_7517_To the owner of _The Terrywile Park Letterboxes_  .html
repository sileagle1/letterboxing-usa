box "Mother Rabbit" is missing.  We checked all around the place and <br/>
even the small rocks at the base of the Africa rock were missing.  <br/>
Someone stamped in yesterday and at the "Beacon Box" made NO mention <br/>
of the missing box.  The 4x4 #9 post is missing as well but we could <br/>
figure it out pretty easily.  Lots of unmarked trails (on the map) in <br/>
that park.  Enjoyed your stamps especially, the Beacon stamp, but <br/>
what a trail!! Real tough with a three year old on my back (in a <br/>
pack). <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know as to Mother Rabbit.  I would like to return to <br/>
finish your collection!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!!<br/>
