I think that it's good to keep retired boxes on LbNA but <br/>
ideally they should be marked as such. I've switched BOB's <br/>
boxes that forward to pages that have been removed to not <br/>
forward. It would be great if the author could mark there <br/>
boxes as retired if they are. It looks like that was done <br/>
for one of BOB's letterbox.<br/>

I, too, am more interested in the finding of the box than the hike. <br/>
This issue has been chatted about before regarding missing boxes. <br/>
There are a number of boxes on the database, some by prominent<br/>
letterboxers even, that say things like "9/5/2003 -- box reporting<br/>
missing.  Will check on status soon."  A year-and-a-half later and no<br/>
update.<br/>
<br/>
At least, however, those boxes give some clue that the box might not<br/>
be there.  The real frustrating thing is when a bunch of people<br/>
confirm a box missing but the placer never updates the clues.  There's<br/>
no indication on the site, so we ignorantly hunt the box that isn't there.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, that's a rant.  As far as retired boxes go, an enhancement<br/>
that would indicate such on the site would be great.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the commments.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, Scott,<br/>
<br/>
I tried for months to contact Bob, Jeremy, and Greta.  Nada.  Bob is Jeremy's father and his email is inactive. I have no idea why they can no longer box, but they at least they said they were abandoning the sport.  So now, what of the boxes still out there? What of the nice hikes that those boxes drew 'boxers to? Do we leave those abandoned boxes to litter the earth?<br/>
<br/>
We (Team Safari) have volunteered to co-adopt the Proposal Series with another boxer who posted interest on Jeremy's message board.  Actually, it's more like foster care. <br/>
<br/>
Dan and I recently took a ride up to Purgaory and "found" all 4, but the problem with #1 was all that was left was the corner of a log book. Something or someone took all the rest. (We replaced the box and log but had no stamp, and had to relocate the box. The other adopter told me that she is going to get or make a stamp.) The rest of the boxes (3) are there, and okay. The last box has a new log book. Our co-adopter lives in the area of the series and is going to take care of these, and when they are ready to go, one of us will repost the clues. <br/>
<br/>
The clues were probably removed previously from LbNA when the "new site" prompted the webmasters to take boxes off the listings if no placer claimed them. People couldn't find the boxes or contact the placers...  but 3 of the four boxes were right there where they were in 2001!!  One stamp had gone missing and another boxer replaced it with an "x o" stamp. (That was fitting for a proposal box. <s>) One toally soaked-through and ballooned log book sits here, dried in my home, waiting to be claimed. <br/>
<br/>
SO! That's 3 out of 4 boxes and logs, and 2 out of 4 stamps that made it from 2001 to 2005 in a HEAVILY used park and with no placers looking after them.  Pretty amazing.  I have to credit fellow boxers with their care.  I often see posts reminding others to PLEASE rehide carefully and I have heard way too many stories of missing or trashed boxes. But look at how many people treated these boxes with TLC!  If we had not had such a wet spring, maybe that log book would have done okay.  Finders have obviously been replacing bags, etc.  :-))))<br/>
<br/>
We have cleared adoption with a webmaster. The understanding is that we will care for these boxes but the placers still own them and can reclaim them at any time. If any member of the Disch clan emerges and wants to take over again or retire the series and make sure that none are left unattended to litter the environment, then fine. It really does belong to them, after all. Until then, we will be surrogates for at least these 4.  Maybe you might want to do the same with a box?  In lieu of that, maybe post specifics of a box of theirs with the box name in the header of your post?  i.e.  "MA - Anytown - Box x-y-z not found, placers not found"  Then someone interested in looking for the box could Google or Yahoo the name to find out any info and decide for themselves whether to try a search (and possibly a rescue), or just fuggeddabouddit.<br/>
<br/>
I think the Disches pretty much said that they were out of it, but didn't explain what they intended to do about the boxes left out there.  I think they are just walking away, but hoped that someone would still enjoy hunting for any boxes that remain. It sounds like they were getting discouraged with having to constantly replace missing stamps or ruined boxes and have decided to let happen what will to the boxes still out there.<br/>
<br/>
I personally wouldn't want the webmasters here to remove any clues just because the placer is absent or not responding to correspondence.  I'm sure that there are other boxes in "the basement" still, because of similar circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't realize that any of their boxes were still listed on LbNA, Scott, probably because I'm not from MA and haven't looked.  I had to hunt a little for the Proposal clues.  I understand your frustration. But you did find Jeremy's webpage and even if he is not minding it, there is info about their boxes on the guestbook there.  You and anyone else have the opportunity to try the hike and maybe find a box that's still there.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows them or hears anything from the Disch family, please ask them to contact me. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>

<br/>
Interesting story.  It's great that you are willing to adopt abandoned<br/>
boxes.  But your comment: "I personally wouldn't want the webmasters<br/>
here to remove any clues just because<br/>
the placer is absent or not responding to correspondence."  prompts my<br/>
reply.<br/>
<br/>
If the placers just went away and left their boxes and clues, great. <br/>
They didn't.  They took their clues with them.  The webmasters<br/>
wouldn't be removing clues (there are none), just dead links.<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=3398&amp;boxname=Mount_Wachusett<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=3380&amp;boxname=Blue_Hills<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=3413&amp;boxname=Solitude<br/>
<br/>
All of these "clues" are nothing more than dead links to an external<br/>
site.  Without clues you can't hunt the boxes, so even if the boxes<br/>
are still there, why keep the clues on the db?  All they do is clutter<br/>
it up.<br/>
<br/>
My humble opinion anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your reply.<br/>

I see what you mean, Scott. You do have a point about the links being "dead."  But the webpage exists. What I did was back the URL up to just the www.whiteblazes.com and then went through their site. The guestbook has a sort of running record on some of those boxes you mentioned.  It's not the same as the clues (which may be at the old archived site or not) but you can read about what others have found.  Anyone truly interestested in investigating the boxes have a starting point here. You could even try contacting the people who posted to the guestbook for more info.  I was happy to have been directed there by a link because I hooked up with others and found a link to email Greta. <br/>
<br/>
I look at it differently than you, that's all. I see why you think the links are just clutter and a dead end.  I looked at it as an avenue of investigation. <s>  Do you want some help trying to track down clues for any of these?  It may help to think of it as a good mystery. I'd forget about Wachusett unless you want to revamp the box with a new stamp and work around a snake. I guess the place has a great view.  If I were a skier I would have tried to find it. I have no reason to poke around Wachusett. Yet.<br/>
<br/>
If you want help to try to track down info on these, contact me off-list and we can put our heads together.<br/>

  Hi Safari Woman:<br/>
<br/>
  Interesting story.  It's great that you are willing to adopt abandoned<br/>
  boxes.  But your comment: "I personally wouldn't want the webmasters<br/>
  here to remove any clues just because<br/>
  the placer is absent or not responding to correspondence."  prompts my<br/>
  reply.<br/>
<br/>
  If the placers just went away and left their boxes and clues, great. <br/>
  They didn't.  They took their clues with them.  The webmasters<br/>
  wouldn't be removing clues (there are none), just dead links.<br/>
<br/>
  For example:<br/>
  http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=3398&amp;boxname=Mount_Wachusett<br/>
  http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=3380&amp;boxname=Blue_Hills<br/>
  http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=3413&amp;boxname=Solitude<br/>

&gt; http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=3413&amp;boxname=Solitude<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All of these "clues" are nothing more than dead links to <br/>
&gt;an external<br/>
&gt; site.  Without clues you can't hunt the boxes, so even <br/>
&gt;if the boxes<br/>
&gt; are still there, why keep the clues on the db?  All they <br/>
&gt;do is clutter<br/>
&gt; it up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My humble opinion anyway.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for your reply.<br/>
