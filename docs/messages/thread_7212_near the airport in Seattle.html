                    <div class="plaintext-content">Right now, I don't think there -are- any that are very close to the airport <br/>
that I know of.  (At least none that I've found, LOL!)  They're mostly <br/>
scattered in the parks in the north part of the city, or in West Seattle, <br/>
which is still north of you at Sea-Tac.<br/>
<br/>
And while I'd like to think this would be a faboo reason to go place a few <br/>
for you to find, I do think that maybe three hours, given the recent extra <br/>
time/headaches in plane travel, and the construction they're doing out at <br/>
the 'port that makes it a good hour-long stroll to find anything you're <br/>
supposed to, like, oh, say, your GATE....you probably won't have time to do <br/>
much more than browse the Made in Washington stores and munch some dried <br/>
salmon jerky before you're on your way again.<br/>
<br/>
Bummer!<br/>
<br/>
I'd gladly place one at the airport itself for you, but I think they'd <br/>
probably close the whole place down if they found unattended tupperware <br/>
with unidentified contents! :) :) :)<br/>
