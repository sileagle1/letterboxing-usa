A few miles north of Ironton, Ohio off State Route #93, is a lovely <br/>
state park on the site of an old 19th century iron furnace.  It is <br/>
named Lake Vesuvius State Park after the Vesuvius Furnace which <br/>
operated there.  Only the stone stack of the furnace remains.  Iron <br/>
ore, limestone, and charcoal were poured into the top of the stack <br/>
and air was blasted inside.  The intense heat separated the oxygen <br/>
from the iron oxide and the carbon form the charcoal bonded with the <br/>
freed oxygen molecules.  The limestone bonded with many of the other <br/>
impurities of the ore and formed slag which floated to the top of the <br/>
molten iron.  The bottom of the furnace was then tapped to allow the <br/>
molten iron to run out into casting channels pressed in sand to form <br/>
managable sized pieces of iron.  These pieces sprouting off a main <br/>
channel reminded some of a mother pig and her nursing pigs.  Thus the <br/>
term "pig iron".  Make your way to the opening of the furnace stack <br/>
nearest the road and take a bearing of 152.  Walk about 22 paces (1 <br/>
pace = 2 steps) on this heading to a rather large tree with four <br/>
trunks.  At this tree take a bearing of 60 and walk about 6 paces.  <br/>
You should be standing on the old slag pile from the furnace (note <br/>
all the shiny black rocks) close to an old stone retaining wall.  If <br/>
you look in the hole where one of the large stones is missing, you <br/>
should find the newest pig at Vesuvius Furnace hiding under some <br/>
smaller rocks.<br/>
