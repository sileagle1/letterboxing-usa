You would think those salt ponds would be sacred, but since the shore <br/>
was once a naval airfield I guess things will never be in their <br/>
natural state there. <br/>
<br/>
btw, we saw a real estate ad this summer for an island for sale at <br/>
the east end of the pond (Cranberry Island? Something like that). 10 <br/>
acres with a cottage smack dab in the middle of a National Wildlfe <br/>
Refuge. Wish that lottery ticket had hit!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the update,<br/>
