<br/>
The past two weeks I've been all over our area hutning and checking <br/>
and out of the twelve boxes hunted two were missing and six were <br/>
hardly covered.  The two missing ones had been bulldozed and <br/>
ironicly they were 150 miles apart.  The hardly covered ones, a few <br/>
of them mine, started to give "trail rage".  After stamping in I <br/>
noticed the last stampers were all different. Could everyone be <br/>
doing a bad job rehiding?  Last night watching a thunderstorm roll <br/>
through I obsevered how the recently cut grass clippings were blown <br/>
around and then washed away by the rain.  I could visulize a box <br/>
covered by only pine straw or leaves being uncovered naturally.  <br/>
Could the one responsible for leaving our boxes out in the open be <br/>
Mother Nature herself?  <br/>
