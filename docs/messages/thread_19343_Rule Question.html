 There are some letterboxers that mask clues,code clues and create <br/>
mystery boxes. If a National Park is used in the title of a clue <br/>
sheet it probably will not last long unless the NPS folks in charge <br/>
of the park look the other way. If you use any prominent location in <br/>
a title of a letterbox and clue sheet, that clue sheet can be <br/>
located by google. This can be true for any letterbox that is posted <br/>
on the LBNA site, unless you have your own web site and have blocked <br/>
this function. I am not promoting National Park plantings, but there <br/>
are some that have been planted and have not been discovered by our <br/>
big brother. The google site can pose other problems as well. We <br/>
have had folks find our clue sheets on google and write us asking <br/>
what the heck it was. If someone with a streak on meaness picks up <br/>
clue sheets, would they pick up letterboxes?<br/>
