                    <html><body>I just wanted to thank everyone who made my day so great yesterday.  I had so much fun!  It was so great to meet all the new folks as well as see my old pals the ADG, Squirrel, and of course - Mudmommy!  <br/>
<br/>
I was so glad to meet DandShoo - it's great to be able to put faces with names, isn't it?  I'm so glad you were able to make it.  I love that D knows all about all the boxes and all the people who placed them.  He is a letterboxing encyclopedia!<br/>
<br/>
I also had a great time with The Doubtful Guests.  I LOVED that you copied my log book from the Reston box for me!  It's hard to get back to all the boxes you've planted so it was so great to see all the people who had stamped in!<br/>
<br/>
And the Doubtful Guests provided me with my very first exchange with a four legged boxer!  Thank you Tux!  It was so nice meeting all of you.  And Cozy, I still love your name!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Mudmommy I am now "in" with the west coast boxers - I have my own pair of purple socks, complete with toes!<br/>
<br/>
And of course many, many thanks to the ADG for the way cool stamp. (and of course the CANDY!)  I love it!  I thought about making a box for it, but I don't know if I can part with it!<br/>
<br/>
I wished I could have spent more time with Donna and Squirrel.  I'm so glad you were both there.  Hopefully we can all get together again so I can hang out with you guys a little more!<br/>
<br/>
This whole email is just chock full of exclamation points.  But what can I say - yesterday was the best.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  I loved all the Rockburn Branch Trail Series stamps.  They were very cool.<br/>
