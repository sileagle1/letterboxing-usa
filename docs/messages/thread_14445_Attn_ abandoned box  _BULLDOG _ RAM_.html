&gt; Rings in Heaven needs the ink pad replaced...and I can't seem to <br/>
&gt; contact an owner? Perhaps it is you? Or you know who it is? <br/>
&gt; If not, I would like to take care of it<br/>
<br/>
BullDog and the Ram were the placers. Isosceles and I were out to Brunswick <br/>
about a month or so ago and the stamp was also broken in half.  The box <br/>
sees frequent visitors.  I ususally bring an extra log book, but if you saw that it <br/>
was in need of repair I would probably wait to see if you hear back from this <br/>
list in regards to the box... don't know if that helps or not.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck -! <br/>
