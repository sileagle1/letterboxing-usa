emails and reading all about this on the website, that I tend to <br/>
agree with Jen's feelings here... maybe it's better to just do this <br/>
quietly ourselves, so we don't step on anyone's "toes"?<br/>
<br/>
I signed up for this for myself, my two kids, and my girlfriend and <br/>
her son, to enjoy doing together.  We homeschool, and I thought this <br/>
would be a fantastic hobby to get into, even if we only stay mostly <br/>
local to our part of the state.  But I do look forward to getting <br/>
into this.  Seems like this could still be tons of fun!  I hope the <br/>
negativity fades...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me say my $.02, as a newbie!<br/>
