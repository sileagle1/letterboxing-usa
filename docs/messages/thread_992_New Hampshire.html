<div>Hello everyone,</div>
<div>    We just got back from a beautiful 
weekend in New Hampshire where we were kept busy finding all the letterboxes up 
that way.  Jay, we found your Monadnock Box, only two others had been there 
though.  We were quite surprised.  The Pumpelly Trail was a great 
hike!!  We also found Sheiling Forest box #1.  Such a neat place, a 
great walk after our climb up the Mt.  We took the guide book and found out 
a lot of neat info.  Also found the box at Noone Falls.  Looks like a 
fun place to bike!  Unfortunately we couldn't seem to find box #2 at 
Sheiling Forest.  We are 99% sure we had the right place, but the spot was 
empty.  </div>
<div>    Hope you are all busy making more up 
there, as the Monadnock Region is one of our favorite camping spots.  Hope 
everyone is having a Happy 4th of July!!</div>

Yay!  More visitors to my only 2 letterboxes (Shieling Forest #1 and
Noone Falls)!
<p>Bonnie, I've received at least 2 (maybe 3?) postcards from letterboxers
who have said that they've tried to find Shieling Forest #2, but were unsuccessful. 
I hope the box hasn't gone missing - I have yet to look for it myself so
I'll check on it.
</p><p>By the way, I've been thinking about changing my stamp for the Noone
Falls letterbox to something a little more representative of the box location
- has anyone else changed a stamp for one of their letterboxes?  Do
y'all think this is kosher?

"Live Free or Die," that is the motto of New Hampshire. The Scottish clans take the motto seriously during the New Hampshire Highland Games. Held at Loon Mountain Ski Resort, it is the largest Gathering of the Scottish Clans in the Northeast. Clans from all the Northeast states are represented as well as clans from across America. Whisky tasting, Sheepdog trials, parades, fiddle rally, Heavyweight Scottish Athletics, dancing, pipe bands, and plenty of food for three days. Kilts were the standard of dress, each clan in its own tartan. Ask any man "What do you wear under your kilt?" The answer, as everyone knows, is socks and shoes. But, then there is Y-Nought. His response is "Socks, shoes and my logbook."  Being newly married, Y-Nought's bride kept a sharp eye on him and his logbook; he was unable to obtain any new exchanges.<br/>
<br/>
The Enfield Shaker Museum was once home to three families of Shakers. Called the "Chosen Vale," The Shakers lived and farmed on this land for 130 years before selling to the LaSalettes. I think it is interesting that the reason the Shakers moved was a decline in membership. Not surprising considering their views on the pleasures of marriage. Today the museum preserves the simple life and traditions of the Shakers. Not a bad way to spend an afternoon. <br/>
<br/>
I found The Basin at Franconia Notch State Park to be a bit on the crowded side, but the beauty of the falls and trails made it worth hiking. I followed along the Cascade Brook on the Basin-Cascades Trail. There were numerous waterfalls, dozens of cascades and pools along this mile long hike. For a more challenging hike, I highly recommend the Lonesome Lake Loop. Close to 14 miles with five summits. There are overnight camping spots along the trail, so come prepared. <br/>
<br/>
Leaving the mountains, I drove on down to the historic town of Portsmouth. Staying at the Inn at Strawberry Banke was a good choice; everything I wanted to see was within walking distance. Except for the Isles of Shoals. Had to take the M/V Thomas Laighton to explore the islands. The Isles of Shoals is unique in that some of the islands are owned by New Hampshire, some by Maine. The Islands also are unique in their bizarre history: Blackbeard's honeymoon, artist's colony, poets, mysteries and murder. But, I did not come here to talk about kilts, farming, cascades or pirates; I came to talk letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
New Hampshire has almost 500 letterboxes and one-third of them are drivebys. There are only about 30 mysteries in the state; not good odds for a mystery lover. New Hampshire is another one of those cold and snowy states; best to use good materials. But then again, good materials are not going to help you if you don't keep the letterboxes covered. New Hampshire, do you know what covering means? Covering: something that covers or conceals. On the upside there are some nice hand carved stamps out there and some interesting locations. Check the weather when hiking in New Hampshire; most storms are forecast well in advance. If a nor'easter is predicted, it is not wise to climb Mt. Washington. Wear proper gear in the winter months. Exposure is the greatest cause of death to amateur hikers. Always let someone know where you will be; this is especially important in any of the mountain ranges. Safety should always come first. <br/>

Considering that the State of New Hampshire is a tourist state, I think it would be rude to say that the kind folk from New Hampshire don't know how to cover our boxes. I just did a check on a series of 26 boxes and all but 1 were uncovered. AND if you had been watching some of our posts over tha last few weeks, due to the rapid rate the snow has melted, some of the cover that was used to hide our boxes, specially in the White Mountains, where there still is snow, has shifted. Us folk in New Hampshire use the spring to do most of maintenance so to claim we don't know how to cover our boxes during this time of year, is quite rude. As for drive-by boxes, again this is a tourist state and I would imagine that some of our best planters in the state would love to have a passer by, find from a foreign state. Mystery boxes don't seem to be high on the list here. There is so much land here and it is so easy to plant a myystery and it never be found. I have one<br/>
 that has been planted for about a year now and hasn't been found yet. No interest maybe, but I think buying high priced gas to drive somewhere to possibly find nothing doesn't interest the locals.<br/>
<br/>
We all don't have the money to drive all over the country, I mean search the internet and make false accusations. Want some real news about New Hampshire, read my blog when I return next month. I will be more than keep New Hampshire and surrounding states up to date about our state. http://teamnewhampshire.blogspot.com<br/>

Good Day!<br/>

<br/>
Before you get your undies in a bunch, perhaps you should take the time to see when I visited New Hampshire. I do believe you will find that spring maintenance was well passed. <br/>
<br/>
Every state is a tourist state. The Forbes top 25 most visited tourist destinations in America does not even list New Hampshire. <br/>
<br/>
As for so much land in New Hampshire, it ranks 44 out of 50 states. That means that there are 43 states that have more land than New Hampshire. <br/>
<br/>
David (Team New Hampshire), I hate to be the one to break this news to you. If out of 26 boxes all but 1 was uncovered, well, that is just not good odds. <br/>
<br/>
The sad fact is that all across the United States letterboxes are in danger. In danger from poor planting practices, sloppy sealing of containers, and the greatest threat of all, not recovering properly. <br/>
<br/>
It is another sad fact that there is just not enough mysteries. Plant and they will come. <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>

It is quite amazing what happens when you add 2 letters to the beginning of a word. I meant that out of 26 boxes, 1 was uncovered. A clear error on my part.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to see the link to this Forbes top 25 list you speak of because Forbes is based out of New York City. The only list I found listed Time Square as #1 which was written by them. Sounds a bit like they don't get out much. Anyone that lives in New England knows that any state in New England is a huge tourist attraction which even more includes the beautiful White Mountains and history laden covered bridges of New Hampshire. <br/>
<br/>
New Hampshire having more land was taken out of context. I said there is so much land here, not the most. There is so much land in which can be accessed by driving long distance which is state owned and trail accessable. If you travel to this land north of Concord, our state capital if you didn't know, the popluation drops conciderably. Talk to anyone from New Hampshire and anywhere south of Concord is concidered North Massachusetts. Wanna complain about anything in this state, complain about how Milford has way to many boxes!<br/>
<br/>
How many boxes did you find in New Hampshire anyway? I bet it was a low percent out of the 503 listed on AQ or the 695 listed on LBNA! How many of those found were uncovered?<br/>

As for so much land in New Hampshire, it ranks 44 out of 50 states. That means that there are 43 states that have more land than New Hampshire. <br/>
<br/>
David (Team New Hampshire), I hate to be the one to break this news to you. If out of 26 boxes all but 1 was uncovered, well, that is just not good odds. <br/>
<br/>
The sad fact is that all across the United States letterboxes are in danger. In danger from poor planting practices, sloppy sealing of containers, and the greatest threat of all, not recovering properly. <br/>
<br/>
It is another sad fact that there is just not enough mysteries. Plant and they will come. <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Mr. Bacon,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Considering that the State of New Hampshire is a tourist state, I think it would be rude to say that the kind folk from New Hampshire don't know how to cover our boxes. I just did a check on a series of 26 boxes and all but 1 were uncovered. AND if you had been watching some of our posts over tha last few weeks, due to the rapid rate the snow has melted, some of the cover that was used to hide our boxes, specially in the White Mountains, where there still is snow, has shifted. Us folk in New Hampshire use the spring to do most of maintenance so to claim we don't know how to cover our boxes during this time of year, is quite rude. As for drive-by boxes, again this is a tourist state and I would imagine that some of our best planters in the state would love to have a passer by, find from a foreign state. Mystery boxes don't seem to be high on the list here. There is so much land here and it is so easy to plant a myystery and it never be found. I have one<br/>
&gt; that has been planted for about a year now and hasn't been found yet. No interest maybe, but I think buying high priced gas to drive somewhere to possibly find nothing doesn't interest the locals.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We all don't have the money to drive all over the country, I mean search the internet and make false accusations. Want some real news about New Hampshire, read my blog when I return next month. I will be more than keep New Hampshire and surrounding states up to date about our state. http://teamnewhamps hire.blogspot. com<br/>

&gt; New Hampshire having more land was taken out of context.  I said there is so much land here, not the most. There is so much land in which can be accessed by driving long distance which is state owned and trail accessable. If you travel to this land north of Concord, our state capital if you didn't know, the popluation drops conciderably. Talk to anyone from New Hampshire and anywhere south of Concord is concidered North Massachusetts. Wanna complain about anything in this state, complain about how Milford has way to many boxes!<br/>

&gt; How many boxes did you find in New Hampshire anyway? I bet it was a low percent out of the 503 listed on AQ or the 695 listed on LBNA! How many of those found were uncovered?<br/>

David, <br/>
I wouldn't let inspector get to you. As far as tourism goes... most of the people who come to NH are second home owners from the Massachusetts. My husband does a lot of work for them.  I have not found any letter boxes uncovered.  <br/>
<br/>
I have gone searching for letterboxes that weren't there any longer. I don't know if people find accidentally and take them because they think they are cool or what..  <br/>
<br/>
My question is this... <br/>
<br/>
Can you put a note on top of the box that states.  Please do not remove this part of a game. Please return to original placement.  Or something like that...  <br/>
<br/>
I agree with you about finding mystery boxes. The secondary roads in NH aren't always the greatest and traveling to some areas can cause car problems. <br/>
<br/>
My grandson and I placed our first letterbox this weekend.  Butterflies where Bison roamed.  <br/>

<br/>
yup, i have to agree with the uncovered boxes. over the past 2 months i have<br/>
been out boxing or checking on boxes in 3 new england states. out of 50<br/>
boxes 42 of them were uncovered. not all of these where in new hampshire,<br/>
but the majority were. it was obvious to me that these were cases of poor<br/>
covering. When i first started letterboxing i never ran across boxes that<br/>
were not hid well. now this is not the case. it is very disappointing to be<br/>
walking towards where you think the box is and see it sitting on top of its<br/>
coverings. it makes me feel like i really did not "find" the box. it is even<br/>
sadder to reach for the box and find the lid has not been closed. i have<br/>
rescued more than one box recently in this condition. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, we've had the opposite experience. We're fairly new to<br/>
letterboxing, but have probably gone to over 100 in NH so far, another<br/>
50 in MA, and a few in other states. The numbers might be higher - my<br/>
wife keeps track of that. I can only think of one box that was visible<br/>
at all from the trail. That was part of a group planted by a high<br/>
school class and looked more like someone not experienced in hiding.<br/>
We've gotten better at spotting "suspicious" coverings, but have not<br/>
seen any out in the open.<br/>
<br/>
I'm excluding some obvious uncovered boxes - Some at a gathering and<br/>
some at a house where they just had a collection in their yard.<br/>
Otherwise, we've had to do plenty of digging, and many some serious<br/>
hunting, to get the ones we have.<br/>

Mr. Bacon,<br/>
<br/>
It is nice to hear that the voices of reason are in New England. Where did you say you were from?<br/>
<br/>
You accuse the people of New Hampshire of not covering boxes. How many people live in the states now? Your comment makes it seem as though we are the only ones that search for our boxes. My comments to you would have been a bit kinder if you didn't target the kind folk of New Hampshire as ignorant finders who don't know how to recover a found box. I have followed all you posts and you haven't been so brutal until you hit New Hampshire. Yes, like Uneksia, I waited patiently for you to tell us about your visit to our state and I myself, found your report to be quite over blown out of preportion. You not mention how many boxes you found in any one state, leading us to believe that you found all or none, then make silly claims about what you may or may not have found. But of course we can't rely on your logbook. If says you only found 3 New Hampshire letterboxes. Is this what you make your allegations on? Did you find 1, 2,or3 boxes uncovered? I still<br/>
 find it hard to believe that you have traveled all over the states visiting all these places and then had the presents of mind to tell us what was wrong with out state. We all know what the issues are in letterboxing. We don't need to listen to someone who thinks they are better than everyone else. If I wanted to do that, I would head to Rhode Island and visit someone.<br/>
<br/>
Curious. If recovering letterboxes is such a big deal to you, why not post something in the clues of the boxes you planted? It goes "Speak softly and carry a big stick." Not the other way around.<br/>

As I read your email while sipping my morning Earl Grey, my tiara almost fell off of my well-coiffed head! What an atrocious little response! It is littered with misspellings and poor grammar which is so gauche.<br/>
<br/>
Your language and grammar are abhorrent. If Headmaster Nigel Jones were still alive, he would have died! Have you not heard of a great little invention called "Spell Check?" It certainly seems not.<br/>
<br/>
Her Ladyship suggests you invest a little of your spare beer change and take a class on remedial spelling and grammar. It certainly would serve you well!<br/>

Hopefully, you will have the "presents" of mind to do so!<br/>

&gt; Mr. Bacon,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is nice to hear that the voices of reason are in New England. Where did you say you were from?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You accuse the people of New Hampshire of not covering boxes. How many people live in the states now? Your comment makes it seem as though we are the only ones that search for our boxes. My comments to you would have been a bit kinder if you didn't target the kind folk of New Hampshire as ignorant finders who don't know how to recover a found box. I have followed all you posts and you haven't been so brutal until you hit New Hampshire. Yes, like Uneksia, I waited patiently for you to tell us about your visit to our state and I myself, found your report to be quite over blown out of preportion. You not mention how many boxes you found in any one state, leading us to believe that you found all or none, then make silly claims about what you may or may not have found. But of course we can't rely on your logbook. If says you only found 3 New Hampshire letterboxes. Is this what you make your allegations on? Did you find 1, 2,or3 boxes uncovered? I still<br/>
&gt; find it hard to believe that you have traveled all over the states visiting all these places and then had the presents of mind to tell us what was wrong with out state. We all know what the issues are in letterboxing. We don't need to listen to someone who thinks they are better than everyone else. If I wanted to do that, I would head to Rhode Island and visit someone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Curious. If recovering letterboxes is such a big deal to you, why not post something in the clues of the boxes you planted? It goes "Speak softly and carry a big stick." Not the other way around.<br/>

  &gt;It is a pleasure to hear from you, I see you are just as astute as <br/>
  &gt;ever. I could not help but notice, however, that you failed to <br/>
  &gt;recommend that David consider a reading comprehension class as well. <br/>
  &gt;After all, you must know how to read before you can spell.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Sincerely,<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Investigator Francis Bacon<br/>

  &gt; &gt; As I read your email while sipping my morning Earl Grey, my tiara <br/>
  &gt; almost fell off of my well-coiffed head! What an atrocious little <br/>

  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Your language and grammar are abhorrent. If Headmaster Nigel <br/>

  &gt; great little invention called "Spell Check?" It certainly seems not.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Her Ladyship suggests you invest a little of your spare beer <br/>
  &gt; change and take a class on remedial spelling and grammar. It <br/>
  &gt; certainly would serve you well!<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Hopefully, you will have the "presents" of mind to do so!<br/>

&gt; response! It is littered with misspellings and poor grammar which is so gauche.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Your language and grammar are abhorrent. If Headmaster Nigel <br/>
&gt; Jones were still alive, he would have died! Have you not heard of a <br/>
&gt; great little invention called "Spell Check?" It certainly seems not.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Her Ladyship suggests you invest a little of your spare beer <br/>
&gt; change and take a class on remedial spelling and grammar. It <br/>
&gt; certainly would serve you well!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hopefully, you will have the "presents" of mind to do so!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Tsk, tsk, tsk!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Her Ladyship<br/>
&gt;<br/>

Yes, I exist. I, Investigator Francis Bacon, am an actual and true<br/>
letterboxer. The plants I have are actual plants, as the finds are actual<br/>
finds. Perhaps you should do a bit of research. Very handy, research is, for<br/>
an actual and true letterboxer. <br/>
<br/>
You can count on my going away. You can also count on my reappearing.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
<br/>
Investigator Francis Bacon<br/>

&gt; Does anyone one know if investigator bacon actually exists as a true<br/>
LB'er? It sounds like he is going on tourist sites for various states and<br/>
using that information to sound like he has been there. 3/4 of the mail I am<br/>
receiving is from him or a reply to him. I think, if he actually exists, he<br/>
is a very lonely man looking for some attention and many are feeding into<br/>
it. I wouldn't be surprised if his next topic is from a state noone has ever<br/>
heard of, like a new one on the moon recently occupied and has LB'es<br/>
already. Of course they are all his and are all covered. If people stop<br/>
responding to him maybe he will go away.<br/>
