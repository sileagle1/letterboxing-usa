Finding the right images for a stamp to carve and bring... Cost:<br/>
Incalculable!<br/>
Carving the stamp over and over till it's right...                 Cost:<br/>
More than you'll admit!<br/>
Getting all the supplies you need together...                     Cost:<br/>
Unbelievable!<br/>
Driving all the  way to the event...                                   Cost:<br/>
Don't want to know!<br/>
<br/>
Making lifetime friends...<br/>
Cost:  Priceless!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the wonderful people I met at the vent today!<br/>

Well said Steve. Pandora and I wanted to thank everyone for the <br/>
wonderful time and simply amazing stamps that we were able to see. <br/>
She sort of over did her self at the event. Once you get the girl out <br/>
letterboxing you might as well try to hold back the four winds. But <br/>
she is resting well and I am sure will be up, bright-eyed and bushy <br/>
tailed in the morning. We also wanted to add that we really enjoyed <br/>
the great conversations, and it was great meeting all of you. I look <br/>
forward to getting to know you all better. Even that masked man that <br/>
was there for awhile. <br/>
<br/>
[forms a hint of a smile on his face]<br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well.<br/>
