                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds like you took wonderful advantage of this great afternoon!  We <br/>
have hunted many of these same boxes in the past couple of weeks.  I <br/>
think Salamander must have very long legs because his pace count does <br/>
not match mine on some of his boxes.  I suspect that's what happened <br/>
on Mound Eyes.  We took a few more steps and were able to see the <br/>
yellow object.  Cardinal Mom was down in the briars for a very long <br/>
time but ultimately did come up with Pining Away.  As I recall, the <br/>
holly tree was pretty close to some very impressive ant hills.  Kick <br/>
Up Your Heels was missing when we looked for it but Salamander sent <br/>
me an email a couple of days ago saying he had replaced it this <br/>
week.  At Yoctangee, we also couldn't find Yoctangee Baden, Barefoot <br/>
In The Park (We found shrub and 3 rocks but no box.), and Hin <br/>
Mallets.  As a consolation, we found Yoctangee Park while looking for <br/>
something else!  I'm not sure where you're from but if you're in the <br/>
area we have a few hidden around Jackson county now as well.  Happy <br/>
Hunting!<br/>
