<br/>
I am new to this sport, but some friends and I decided to spend a rainy<br/>
Sunday (yesterday) searching for the only Chicago-area letterbox, in<br/>
Evanston.<br/>
<br/>
We were excited because we didn't even know what we were looking for. We<br/>
had managed to find the apparition of Mary on the tree in Rogers Park, so<br/>
we were 1-0 when we got to Evanston. Followed the clues from the<br/>
letterboxing website to the particular spot, where we performed the<br/>
specified exercises and scoured the area.<br/>
<br/>
We couldn't find the letterbox. Anyone know what the condition of this<br/>
letterbox is? There is a lot of recent construction activity immediately<br/>
behind the bushes where the clues lead us. They had set up a temporary<br/>
chain-link fence and splashed a lot of excess concrete into the area.<br/>
<br/>
I'm worried that the letterbox may have been uncovered or tampered with by<br/>
the construction workers. We saw two attractive metal boxes among a pile of<br/>
shovels and other construction tools, but didn't dare venture behind the<br/>
locked fence to disturb the workmen's tools just to see if they might be<br/>
letterboxes. This being our first letterbox, we weren't even sure what kind<br/>
of container we should be looking for. Perhaps someone who is familiar with<br/>
the Evanston letterbox can tell us if we just didn't look hard enough or if<br/>
someone should go rescue the boxes before the construction workers take<br/>
them away!<br/>

<div>Hey Matt,</div>
<div>         I 
found the Evanston box August 22nd and it was in pretty good shape. The cover on 
the sketch book was a little weathered but the insides were undamaged.I believe 
that you were very close. I couldn't find it at first but a strange series of 
events forced me to change my perspective of the area and I was able to find it. 
Cryptic huh? I don't want to ruin the experience for you of finding it on 
your own. By the way you are looking for a smallish Tupperware container with a 
light(white?)colored lid. If you want more detailed help, e-mail me. Good luck 
and happy letterboxing.</div>
