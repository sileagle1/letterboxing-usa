Hi boxers:<br/>
<br/>
Many of you have been following our saga of Lady Prisspott, as she <br/>
was maligned and then vindicated and then maligned and then . . .<br/>
<br/>
Last week, it was announced by Her Ladyship that she and Poison Ivy <br/>
would have a press conference in the Atrium Lounge of the Marriott <br/>
Marquis on Broadway in New York on Saturday, April 2, 2005 at 5pm.<br/>
<br/>
Much of this saga has been written tongue-in-cheek and we have <br/>
received several emails inquiring about it's veracity. Please trust <br/>
us that both LP and Ivy will be at this press conference and it is <br/>
not some grand letterboxing April Fools joke.<br/>
<br/>
So - now that that's out of the way - who's gonna be there????<br/>
<br/>
Your humble letterboxing reporter,<br/>
<br/>
Mark<br/>
<br/>
PS. Details of the press conference may be seen at <br/>
http://markandsuepepe.blogspot.com/ - just look for the Lady <br/>
Prisspott picture on our main page.<br/>

Fear not Warrior Woman, sheath your sword.<br/>
<br/>
Lady Prisspott and I will be there for only an hour (busy, busy, <br/>
busy!), not giving the paparazzi and looky-loos time to gather their <br/>
forces,  and the venue (that day) is more than suitable for the <br/>
occasion.<br/>
<br/>
Lady Prisspott has retired from polite society for this short period <br/>
to regain composure and is currently unable to garner the energy to <br/>
rise from the divan, keeping me quite busy ordering the Prisspott <br/>
Manor servants about in preparation for the trip.<br/>
<br/>
And, though the nature and cause of the appearance has Lady Prisspott <br/>
on the verge of a nervous breakdown (that scandalous photo report) we <br/>
both look forward to meeting, with a brave smile, any who should be <br/>
in the area at the time.<br/>

Hi boxers:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering who is going to NYC to witness Lady Prisspott's coming <br/>
out press conference after her recent scandal.<br/>
<br/>
Please post to this list or email me directly if you are planning to <br/>
attend.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Well, Cap'n Rasha<br/>
<br/>
Rumour has it that Lady Prisspott was trashed in a recent President's <br/>
Day interview.  <br/>
<br/>
Allegations were made that LP drinks wine from the bottle and gorges on <br/>
string cheese when unchaperoned.  Not at all like the refined persona <br/>
we've been led to expect.<br/>
<br/>
LP of course denied everything.<br/>
<br/>
Then the investigative photos were published.<br/>
<br/>
Now, LP is coming out of seclusion to set the public straight in a <br/>
short appearance at the Marriott Marquis in NY City.<br/>
<br/>
The whole scandalous affair has been dutifully recorded by Mark and Sue <br/>
Pepe at http://lpdilemma.blogspot.com .<br/>

Dear Ms. Ivy,<br/>
  I do trust you don't believe those obviously doctored photos of our <br/>
beloved Miss Prisspott acting like a commoner! I was totally shocked <br/>
and dismayed by the wantoness of the poses, the sheer debauchery! <br/>

Nope!  But there will be string cheese and cheap red wine!  <br/>

I would love to attend but I have a previous engagement.  The head of <br/>
my finishing school, Lady Dishrag, was accused of eating Vienna <br/>

Press Conference yesterday at the Marriott Marquis where I met Poison Ivy and <br/>
Lady P.  Boy, I was quite overwhelmed at the sisters' charm and beauty. It just <br/>
blue me away!  We stamped in each others' log books.  I gave them ferrets, they <br/>
gave me three trailer hitches!!  Lady P gave her statement, promised to get <br/>
the help she needs, and then rushed off a bit upset.  I wish I could have spent <br/>
a little more time with these two lovely gals but they were on their way to a <br/>
fundraiser, which I managed to sneak a peek at a few floors down. (Wish I <br/>
could have been a fly on the wall at that one.) <br/>
Needless to say, I am very honored to have met two of the most lovely and <br/>
charming women in our Letterboxing Community. <br/>

Kudos to PI and LP and to you FF.  I had a chance to catch up with <br/>
the ladies in their whirlwind tour of Allentown, PA on the way up to <br/>
NYC from DC.  We had a great time, exploring the hideouts of some <br/>
scary vegetables.  Thanks again for visiting our little letterboxing <br/>
backwater.<br/>

&gt; I am pleased to announce that I was the solo attendee at Lady <br/>
Prisspott's <br/>
&gt; Press Conference yesterday at the Marriott Marquis where I met <br/>
Poison Ivy and <br/>
&gt; Lady P.  Boy, I was quite overwhelmed at the sisters' charm and <br/>
beauty. It just <br/>
&gt; blue me away!  We stamped in each others' log books.  I gave them <br/>
ferrets, they <br/>
&gt; gave me three trailer hitches!!  Lady P gave her statement, <br/>
promised to get <br/>
&gt; the help she needs, and then rushed off a bit upset.  I wish I <br/>
could have spent <br/>
&gt; a little more time with these two lovely gals but they were on <br/>
their way to a <br/>
&gt; fundraiser, which I managed to sneak a peek at a few floors down. <br/>
(Wish I <br/>
&gt; could have been a fly on the wall at that one.) <br/>
&gt; Needless to say, I am very honored to have met two of the most <br/>
lovely and <br/>
&gt; charming women in our Letterboxing Community. <br/>

Madame Prisspott,<br/>
<br/>
I am so pleased to hear that you are getting the help you need.  We are <br/>
here and pulling for you.  I know this must be a difficult time, but <br/>
I'm sure you will triumph over these wrongs.<br/>
