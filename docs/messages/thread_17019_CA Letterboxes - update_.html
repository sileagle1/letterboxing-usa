<br/>
The Jiggs clan had the opportunity to spend a few days in the Lake <br/>
Tahoe area, and were able to check out a few boxes at the same time! <br/>
Here's the latest...<br/>
<br/>
SACRAMENTO GOETHE PARK - Alive, well and very well-visited (we "LET" <br/>
doublesAJ and Ol Blue find this onew first!!)<br/>
<br/>
SPENCER's BONE (Ripon, CA) - another great box - first finders (Ha - <br/>
take that, 2AJ!!)<br/>
<br/>
BRIDGEPORT - alive, well and STILL awaiting its first visitor!<br/>
<br/>
BEAR CUB (Donner Pass) - hibernating. Trail was accessible, but he's <br/>
buried under abour 2 feet of snow!<br/>
<br/>
EMERALD BAY - WOW! Super location on east side of the Lake! Lots of <br/>
visitors! Found the RRR Hitchhiker too (bonus day!)<br/>
<br/>
EAGLE ROCK - We're sure the box is probably fine, but the approach <br/>
paths were snow-covered, so will wait until spring.<br/>
<br/>
LAKE TAHOE NINI BOX - alive and well, in an absolutely gorgeous <br/>
setting on the North Shore of Lake Tahoe! Well worth the "easy" 15 <br/>
min hike straight up!!!<br/>
<br/>
There you have it!<br/>

Hi Jiggs We found the Bridgeport box!! Our third find! And we were<br/>
first. We found it 11-27-03 at 11:00am We must have just missed you.<br/>
We love the stamp...very nice carving. You may be interested in<br/>
knowing that my father worked on this bridge befor it became a park.<br/>
Well have fun out there.<br/>

Amanda from Seattle and I visited this box in October - I think it was the day before <br/>
the N. California get together in Richmond.  We also found the 2 in Modesto that day.  <br/>
Has the ownre changed out the books, because I'm sure we stamped in.<br/>
