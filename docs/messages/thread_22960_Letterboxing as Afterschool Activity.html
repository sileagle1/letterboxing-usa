I would like to create a letterboxing project at the school where I <br/>
work: Salemwood Malden, MA. Similar to the recent request from a Girl<br/>
Scout troop leader, I would be very interested in hearing from any of <br/>
you out there that have had experience involving 10 to 14 year-olds in <br/>
letterboxing. What worked? What didn't? Are there other resources <br/>
available on the web?<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately I would like my small group of students to not only go on a <br/>
few supervised searches for local letterboxes, but also create their <br/>
own in the city of Malden. Surprisingly, I can find no mention of any <br/>
existing sites here.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance,<br/>
Morgan<br/>
