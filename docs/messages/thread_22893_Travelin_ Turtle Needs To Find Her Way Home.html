<br/>
	Travelin' Turtle is hitchhiking her way across the country.  Released in the new <br/>
Pennsylvania Postcard 3 box in Spokane, WA,  Travelin' Turtle seeks to return to her home in <br/>
Eastern Pennsylvania by the good graces of Letterboxers across America.<br/>
<br/>
	You can follow her progress on the Travelin' Turtle blog:  http://<br/>
travelinturtle.blogspot.com.  Pictures, sitreps and wellwishers are welcome.<br/>
<br/>
	If you find the Travelin' Turtle hanging out in a letterbox near you, please move her <br/>
along as quickly as possible to another high-traffic box that is a little bit closer to home.  <br/>
When you get a chance please update us on her progress by posting to the blog or sending <br/>
an email to nattybumppolbna@aol.com.<br/>
<br/>
	Bring 'er on home!<br/>
<br/>
