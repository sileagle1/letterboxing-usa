                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been lurking on this talk list for about a month now which is <br/>
about how long I've been participating in this hobby.  A few times, <br/>
I've really wanted to post but thought I would wait until I saw how <br/>
things worked......<br/>
<br/>
Except now, I want to speak up.  I am new. VERY new.  I love the <br/>
actual hobby and was looking forward to getting the chat on this <br/>
talk list.  I cringe now when I see that there are 43 messages in my <br/>
in-box because it can be time-consuming and disheartening to sort <br/>
through all of the "flame" to get to the good stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
In light of this, I have a little story to share about another of my <br/>
hobbies.  I am also a Swing dancer.  I started about 5 years ago, <br/>
right after a GAP commercial and Brian Setzer made it very popular.  <br/>
Clubs opened; things were good.  EVERYONE was dancing.  A couple of <br/>
years later, the buzz lessened.  When clubs closed, people banded <br/>
together to form groups that would host dances, lessons, and <br/>
performances to keep Swing alive.  It worked for a few years until <br/>
people got nasty.....mostly about web sites, e-mails, and "turf" <br/>
wars.  Now, Swing is dying.  No one new is taking lessons, groups <br/>
are breaking up and there is almost no where left to dance.  People <br/>
have been left with a very bad taste in their mouths and it's all <br/>
very sad.<br/>
<br/>
Looking back, I wish we had all done things differently.  We should <br/>
have put the pettiness aside and focused on the important things.  <br/>
We should have been kinder to each other and not so hasty to preach, <br/>
insult, or demean.  We should have approached each other <br/>
individually instead of airing dirty laundry in very public places.  <br/>
We should have realized that only a finite number of people were <br/>
involved and that, without everyone's participation, Swing would <br/>
just go quietly into the night.<br/>
<br/>
I say all of this because I feel like I want to walk away from this <br/>
head ache in my in-box.  I'm thinking about just printing out my <br/>
clues, contacting placers when necessary,and carrying on by myself.  <br/>
But, I don't want to.  I want to stay here, listen to others with <br/>
more experience, and meet others that have the same sick obsession <br/>
with rubber stamps and RubberMaid containers. (:  If people continue <br/>
to make this as intimidating for newbies as it is right now, <br/>
letterboxing, too, will go quietly into the night.<br/>
<br/>
On that note, I think I've covered everything....I now anxiously <br/>
await all of the flame that is certain to come my way! *wink* LOL<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for hearing me out, <br/>
Kerri <br/>
