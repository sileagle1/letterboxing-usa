Little House On The Prairie Eastford CT. Rating Easy 10 Min. Placed By The =<br/>
NeeDeeps 6-24-03 Directions: From RT.6 or RT. 44 turn onto RT.198 and go to =<br/>
the Natchaug State Forest.This park is also home to a few more letterboxes s=<br/>
o don't forget the clues.Such as General Lyon's Birthplace,1870's Riddle,Tes=<br/>
t Tube Baby,Teddy Bear's Picnic,#1 Teddy,and the Massachusetts State Stamp.O=<br/>
nce you pull in you will travel a total of 1.4 miles,first you will go over =<br/>
a bridge then at 0.7 of a mile you will come to a fork in the road and you w=<br/>
ill go left here.You will pass by some park buildings on both sides of the r=<br/>
oad,and soon you will see General Lyon's Birthplace on your left.Pull in and=<br/>
 drive up and you will see what's left of the house on the left and a place =<br/>
to park on your right.After parking, walk over to the big chimney.(I try to =<br/>
imagine what this place looked like in the 1800's if only I could go back in=<br/>
 time.) Ok you need to go to the West side of the chimney,standing on the we=<br/>
st side with the chimney to your back take a reading of 225 degrees.In the d=<br/>
istance you will see a flat rock near the tree line,go to this rock.Standing=<br/>
 on this flat rock take another reading of 180 degrees pointing into the woo=<br/>
ds,there should be two medium size trees about 15 feet apart you need to go =<br/>
in between them and bushwack down a little hill of rocks with some rock out =<br/>
croppings on both sides of you.(Careful some of the rocks are a little wobbl=<br/>
y.) At the bottom of the small hill stop and take a reading of 255 degrees t=<br/>
o two oaks growing from one,go to that tree.Just behind that tree is another=<br/>
 but smaller oak that also splits into two but the right side is broken off,=<br/>
behind that tree is your little house on the prairie.Make sure you have ever=<br/>
ything and close the door when you leave.The NeeDeeps <br/>
