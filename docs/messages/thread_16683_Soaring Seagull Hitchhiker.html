letterbox today (11/1/2003).  It experienced a good soaking at some<br/>
point (very dry today), so nearly all of the placers comments are<br/>
illegible and some of the stamps are blurred.  A separate typed note<br/>
asks finders to leave a note on the letterboxing e-mail list with<br/>
when and where it was found.  We hope that this is the list the<br/>
placer intended since a quick archive search didn't turn up any<br/>
messages about this hitchhiker and Soaring Seagull wasn't carrying an<br/>
e-mail address.<br/>
<br/>
We noticed that Soaring Seagull is not on Wanda and Petes site. <br/>
Would the placer like an off list update about Soaring Seagulls 2<br/>
years on the road?  We would be happy to share the information with<br/>
Wanda and Pete if theyre interested and the placer doesnt object.<br/>

back in October of '02 at High Rocks in PA. We brought it back to Calif with us <br/>
and placed it in the Contra Costa Series #2 box in November. Haven't heard <br/>
about it since. Glad to hear it's still around and soaring all OVER the <br/>
country!!<br/>
