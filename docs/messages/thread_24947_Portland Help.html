Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a lurking letter boxer and I need help.  I will be in Portland, OR next<br/>
weekend - not this one unfortunately!  I have literally from noon on Weds<br/>
until noon on Thursday to do what want.  I have never been before and who<br/>
knows when I'll be back.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I love the outdoors and nature so I do not want to spend it in the city.  So<br/>
if you had only one day - and a rental car - what would you do?  I'm hoping<br/>
that all you who are there this weekend will have wonderful ideas.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pam<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The visitor's center you probably mean is called "Vista House."  It is<br/>
really a nice drive along the historic highway through the Columbia<br/>
River Gorge, and great hiking.  There are a lot of things to do in<br/>
Portland that don't feel "in the city" - There's Forest Park, which is<br/>
home to the arboretum, the city zoo, the test rose garden<br/>
(beautiful!), the Japanese garden (quiet and beautiful), and 70 miles<br/>
of trails, plus a nice Veitnam Memorial and Foresty Center Museum. <br/>
You could spend a week exploring Forest Park alone.<br/>
 There's also Mt. Tabor, an extinct volcano within Portland city<br/>
limits, and Powell Butte, which both have really nice hiking and great<br/>
views.  We're also big fans of the Audobon Society's trails.  Having<br/>
moved to Portland from Chicago, I would say that the greatest thing<br/>
about Portland is the ability to be "surrounded by nature" without<br/>
ever leaving the city limits.  As a Portlander, I'd recommend one of<br/>
the many natural places in Portland, rather than a trip out of<br/>
Portland for your visit.<br/>
