<br/>
After a too-long hiatus from letterboxing these last several weeks, I made up <br/>
for my "down time" this past Saturday and headed out to Tolland (CT), taking <br/>
advantage of a near-perfect summer day to snag the following letterboxes: New <br/>
England Authors (4-box hike), The Rotten Egg Hunt, Penguin Puzzle and Orange <br/>
Parrot. I am pleased to report that all seven boxes are intact and show all <br/>
the usual signs of frequent visitation. (Actually, I was only the second <br/>
person to have signed in to the Orange Parrot letterbox, which is not quite <br/>
two weeks old.) Kudos to Churchill &amp; the Pinecone, The Women's Hiking Group <br/>
and the Cyr Family for their uniformly interesting hikes and attractive <br/>
stamps (each one hand-carved!). The Cyrs' stamp for the Rotten Egg Hunt is <br/>
especially clever...its hiding place is a bit tricky to find but well worth <br/>
the search. Check it out if you haven't already done so!<br/>
<br/>
The Rotten Egg Hunt, Penguin Puzzle and Orange Parrot are all located in <br/>
Crandall Park (which I presume is a town facility). To anyone attempting to <br/>
find all of these boxes in one fell swoop, I would suggest that you carefully <br/>
read all three sets of clues ahead of time and take a few minutes to study <br/>
the trail map within the park; you will realize that their hiding places can <br/>
be found in a relatively straightforward sequence with a minimum of <br/>
backtracking. Unfortunately, I made this discovery a little too late and <br/>
ended up hiking several segments of the same trail two or three times, making <br/>
me one tired (but happy) pup by the end of the afternoon. <br/>
<br/>
Great to be back 'boxing!<br/>
<br/>

Alan from Axtown<br/>
