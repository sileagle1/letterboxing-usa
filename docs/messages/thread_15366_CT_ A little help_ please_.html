                    <div class="plaintext-content">Howdy, folks. I spent last weekend at Steep Rock in Washington, CT, <br/>
looking for the Shepaug Serpent.<br/>
<br/>
While I did not find it, I did have a fabulous hike and saw a <br/>
gorgeous overlook. So, while I didn't find a box, I found something <br/>
marvelous.<br/>
<br/>
But now, for my question. Help! Would someone email me off list to <br/>
help me figure out where I went wrong on the second box? I'm not <br/>
looking for step-by-step instructions. (The clues are too beautifully <br/>
written.) But, I think I know where I went wrong, and I'm just <br/>
looking for confirmation. <br/>
<br/>
Also, perhaps a hint on box #1. Either my math or my compass skills --<br/>
 or, hey, both -- are suspect. Anyway, if someone would take pity on <br/>
me and email me off-list, I'd appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Selene<br/>

F6 (and loving it)<br/>
