I don't really like the designation Metro DC because the subway system is called the Metro and that may be confusing. It extends out into MD and VA. DC is trying so hard to become a state and most people around here recognize that so I think DC should be treated as a separate state and MD a state and VA a state and not lump us all together into a Metropolotian area. However, since it is such a tight area I think if you want to group some together like the Kid Gloves as Hal and the Magic Mushroom a better indication would be INSIDE THE BELTWAY. They even use that on the news sometimes. But to tell you the truth I am very happy with anything you decide, I am so grateful that you guys are doing this in such a timely manner and it looks so good. Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br/>

I am looking forward to the new boxes that are springing up in the area. Keep them coming.<br/>
