<br/>
We found "Elaine &amp; Jerry's Bluff" today.  The box was<br/>
laying out in the open next to it's hidding spot.  The<br/>
log book was inside, but the stamp and stamp pad were<br/>
missing.  We rehid the box, but don't think  it's safe<br/>
there any longer as there was a note that appeared to<br/>
be from the person that took the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
We also found "Two Labs and a Box" intact, but the<br/>
stamp pad was dry.<br/>
<br/>
Also, to Heather, it appears "Turtle Creek" is<br/>
missing.  We came up empty handed on that one also.<br/>
<br/>
Hope other people had better luck in their searches.<br/>
<br/>
