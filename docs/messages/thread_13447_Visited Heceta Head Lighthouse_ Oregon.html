was our first letterbox find.  My best friend Jeremy carved our <br/>
stamp, and we were very impressed with the stamp in the box.  I <br/>
wasn't sure if there was supposed to be an ink pad in there or not, <br/>
but there wasn't.  We brought our own, just in case.<br/>

<br/>
Out here, we usually don't include a stamp pad in our boxes, like they do in <br/>
the east.  We all carry our own stamp pads (sometimes several--also sometimes <br/>
colored, water-based markers) and choose our own colors.  <br/>
<br/>
Ryan (who's currently hiking the Appalachian Trail) carved that swell stamp <br/>
at Haceta Head.  Before he took off, he set up a regional list-serve for the <br/>
PNW--check us out at LbPNW@yahoogroups.com<br/>
<br/>
We've got a gathering coming up at Milo McIver Park in Oregon on July 12-13.  <br/>
You're very welcome to join us--many of us regional folks will be meeting <br/>
each other for the first time.  (You can check out the regional talk-list archive <br/>
for more info about the gathering, or just stay tuned--there's sure to be <br/>
more buzz as that weekend approaches.) <br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>
