                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last weekend some friends &amp; I hiked through the snow to the top of<br/>
Mount Tom. After a scramble to the top, facing into the howling winds<br/>
off Lake Michigan and driving lake effect snow, I realized that I'd<br/>
made a mistake when I hid a letterbox here last spring. The box is<br/>
called Mount Tom but it isn't on Mount Tom! Coming from the west when<br/>
trees blocked the view, I thought we'd found the peak, but coming from<br/>
the east this time in winter it was obvious which was the true summit. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry to anyone who has searched for this one and left frustrated. The<br/>
box is still there, nobody had found it yet. In the spring I may<br/>
return to find a better hiding spot that is actually on Mount Tom, but<br/>
in the meantime you can find it on a false summit to the south of the<br/>
real peak.<br/>
