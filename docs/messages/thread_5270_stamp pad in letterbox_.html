Most boxes we have found do not have the stamp pads, and we carry our own<br/>
of course. We aren't planning on putting them into the boxes we hide,<br/>
either. Unless we hear differently from this forum!<br/>

                    <html><body><p> In my experience as a novice Letterboxer, stamp pads, my own or those residing in boxes, seem to dry out very quickly. Conversely, loading your own stamp pad with too much ink to gain longevity can lead to a mess. Carrying a couple of sheets of paper-towels is a good idea. I also carry an extra medium ziplock freezer bag just in case one in a box needs to be replaced. These items take up almost no room and can come in very handy if moisture has somehow gotten into a box or a stamp pad has made a mess of things.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Almost every box I have visited has had its own ink pad, so you may want to<br/>
include one with any box you create yourself.  The reasons can be: 1.) You<br/>
want to provide it because the stamp was designed to be a certain color, 2.)<br/>
You want to make sure your visitors can get a good stamp image, for<br/>
instance, you have a big stamp and using a brush marker or small stam pad is<br/>
a pain, 3.)  You want a specific type of ink on your stamp, because if one<br/>
visitor uses their own inky or oily pad and your next visitor has a<br/>
water-based marker or pad, the resulting image is less than nice.  Add to<br/>
that a miriad of colors from different boxers' media and they may find your<br/>
piece of artwork leaving pretty ugly stamp images.<br/>
<br/>
Reasons why you may not want to provide the stamp pad are:  Cost; chance of<br/>
drying out (I have rarely encountered this problem); caps or covers that<br/>
come off easily and make a mess inside the box or plastic bag; water-based<br/>
color runs if water enters the letterbox and bag.<br/>
<br/>
Providing a well-chosen ink with a good-fitting cover with at least enough<br/>
paper towel to wrap your stamp usually brings good results, along with a<br/>
tight letterbox placed where water most likely won't get in.  I bring spare<br/>
paper towels or napkins to clean messy boxes and stamps and to leave behind.<br/>
Sometimes I find a real mess from less-than perfect conditions or just<br/>
carelessness and I tend to try to clean things up.  Sometimes I write "A<br/>
clean stamp is a happy stamp. :-) "  on the napkins I leave behind, just as<br/>
a hint to future boxers that this particular box has been found very inky.<br/>
Stampers can also stamp the image all over their clue sheet until it doesn't<br/>
print anymore, thereby ensuring the ink doesn't end up all over the place.<br/>
Most boxers are very courteous and thoughtful about leaving things neat and<br/>
not walking off with ink pads and pens.  However, we always bring extras<br/>
just in case.<br/>

    Ink pads in letterboxes seem to be mostly a southern New England <br/>
thing, and many letterboxers carry their own assortment of ink pads <br/>
anyway, so it's pretty optional, but we do appreciate those provided <br/>
for special effects or colors we may not be carrying.<br/>

As the only letterboxer in the state, I've made this a Montana thing, as well. Most of the people who find my boxes stumble over them and I was getting complaints that I provided this nice stamp and a lovely spiral-bound book of paper that people could tear leaves out of to take their copies of my stamp home, but I didn't provide stamp pads. Figuring "the customer is always right," I decided to comply with the request that I complete the complement of supplies.<br/>
<br/>
That's just what works for my circumstances, though....<br/>
<br/>
We had 10-12" of fresh snow this morning, but eventually summer will come (THIS is what we call spring) and maybe someone else will start letterboxing out here. I sure hope so! We have a good group of geocachers.<br/>

&gt; complaints that I provided this nice stamp and a lovely spiral-bound book of<br/>
&gt; paper that people could tear leaves out of to take their copies of my stamp<br/>
&gt; home, but I didn't provide stamp pads. Figuring "the customer is always<br/>
&gt; right," I decided to comply with the request that I complete the complement of<br/>
&gt; supplies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes stamp the letterbox stamp on several pages in the back of the<br/>
log I include in the box.  I write down the name of the box, my contact info<br/>
and the website.  In whatever note I write in the log to list the box, I<br/>
mention the stamped pages so that anyone who is stampless can  at least take<br/>
home an impression &amp; info on how to get more.<br/>

Last Saturday I planted a box (clues not posted yet!)and received an <br/>
e-mail yesterday from a hiker who "happened" upon it.  Usually, I <br/>
leave a stamp pad in my boxes but for this particular box I had not.  <br/>
A stamp pad would have benefitted this unexpected finder. So, I think <br/>
this will be the only box that I will plant without a stamp pad.  <br/>
Keeping the stamp pad in a separate plastic bag from the stamp and <br/>
notebook should help avoid messyness.<br/>
