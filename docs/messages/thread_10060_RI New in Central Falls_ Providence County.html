*This is a microbox. Please bring your own ink pad, pen, and <br/>
something for wiping the stamp dry after you use it. You'll be <br/>
looking for a black film canister with only the stamp and a paper <br/>
journal inside.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The smallest city in the smallest state has a total land area of only <br/>
1.21 square miles. It is a densely populated, culturally diverse city <br/>
with several large factories, some of which are still in operation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Location and Parking:<br/>
The letterbox is hidden in Jenks Park, which is surrounded by Broad <br/>
Street to the east, Summit Street to the south, Washington Street to <br/>
the west, and King and Fales Streets to the north. The only entrances <br/>
to this small park are on Broad Street and Washington Street.<br/>
<br/>
There is a fair amount of parking available on the streets near the <br/>
park most of the time, but watch the signs carefully to stay legal.<br/>
<br/>
*Please visit this park during full daylight hours only because heavy <br/>
partying takes place here after dark.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Find the ramp and stairs to the clock tower. From this peculiar <br/>
structure (not the only odd one in the park), you can see for miles <br/>
in many directions on a clear day- check it out.<br/>
<br/>
20 paces up the ramp, just uphill from a group of tall cedar trees, <br/>
look for an oak tree growing into the ledge. The tree has an "eye" in <br/>
its exposed roots. To the left of this is the small crevice that <br/>
hides the small letterbox with the small stamp in the smallest city <br/>
in the smallest state.<br/>
