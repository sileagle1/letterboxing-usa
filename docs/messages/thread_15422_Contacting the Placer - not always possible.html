                    <div class="plaintext-content">A fellow letterboxer brought up the following points about my post<br/>
which I think is very valid and I wanted to share my response/thought<br/>
with everyone.  <br/>
<br/>
They stated that for clues placed on individual websites, the creators<br/>
of those sites don't always think to or choose to place a link allowing<br/>
them to be contacted.  Well, one easy solution (which this posted also<br/>
eluded to) may be that in the clue listings, a column is added to <br/>
included the placer letterboxing name and that links to an email form. <br/>
Maybe there is a way that auto reminders could be sent to members of<br/>
the LBNA site to check that their profiles and email addys are correct<br/>
or to check that emails are valid.  If email are invalid, maybe there<br/>
is a procedure that can be established to try and track down the placer<br/>
or to have the box adopted, or marked with an unknown status due to<br/>
invalid email, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Another point this letterboxer brought up, is that even when there is a<br/>
way to contact a placer, they are not always willing or able to update<br/>
their clue info promptly.  I think this goes back to being responsible<br/>
for the treasures you choose to release and/or enlisting the help of<br/>
others to maintain that info.  At the same time, if you are a boxer for<br/>
whom it is important to have accurate info that a box is in place<br/>
before you attempt it I believe that you will figure out pretty quickly<br/>
which placers in your boxing area are quick and which are slower or<br/>
choose not to keep their info current.  In that case, you keep that in<br/>
mind when you choose boxes to seek.  <br/>
<br/>
The main point here is simply to keep the responsibly to clue updating<br/>
and box info on the placers not the seekers.  It is the placers<br/>
creation and their choice to release and maintain these.  The way and<br/>
detail in which they choose to do that shouldn't be taken away from<br/>
them.  <br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of talented thinkers, problem solvers, programmers, and<br/>
web designers within our ranks.  I am sure as a group we can find a<br/>
reasonable way and have an intelligent discussion about how to solve<br/>
this problem (if it really needs solving) without compromising the<br/>
charm and simplicity of the sport.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, we can all get frustrated by hiking out to a box and not finding<br/>
it.  At the same time, part of the charm of this sport for many is the<br/>
thrill of the hunt.  If treasure hunting were easy and always<br/>
successful, wouldn't we all be out looking for the millions in lost<br/>
treasure and happily living the high life??<br/>
<br/>
The point is to get out, to get moving, to enjoy nature, to discover<br/>
places you never knew existed or to share special place that others<br/>
hold dear.  It is to teach our children there is life outside of the<br/>
TV.  The box at the end is a nice bonus - and an purpose and incentive<br/>
for going.  Yes, a string of MIA boxes can be frustrating - but what<br/>
have you lost?  Would you have gone hiking or exploring in that<br/>
location if the box had not been there?  Did you discover something<br/>
new?<br/>
<br/>
If you don't like that point of view or have reasons why it is<br/>
imperative that every box you seek be found on the first try, only look<br/>
for boxes that have been recently reported on in the list or that you<br/>
know are regularly updated.  If that isn't good enough for you, maybe<br/>
this isn't the right hobby for you. <br/>
<br/>
Nothing we do will ever make everyone happy - but if it ain't broke,<br/>
why are we trying to fix it.  Yes, our numbers have grown significantly<br/>
in the past couple of years.  Still, with simple courtesies and<br/>
communication between seekers and placers the majority of this would be<br/>
cleared up and not an issue at all.  We all have to get to the internet<br/>
somehow to get clues, for the most part, how is it that this simple<br/>
solution can be so difficult?!?!<br/>
