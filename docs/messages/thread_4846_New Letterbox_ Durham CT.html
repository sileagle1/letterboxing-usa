<br/>
Mattabesett Trail, Durham CT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello fellow hikers.  We have decided to place our first letterbox.  The <br/>
Witches Den letterbox will be a cinch to find.  It is located at the Witches <br/>
Den (go figure), a place on the Beseck section of the Mattabesett trail.  <br/>
(Okay, everybody get out your blue book.  Turn to page 39 and map 19.  Oh, by <br/>
the way, the name "Witches Den" does not appear on any map since it is a name <br/>
that I gave the place the first time I saw it.)<br/>
<br/>
You start the hike from the intersection of routes 68 and 157 in Durham. The <br/>
easiest way to get there is to take exit 15 off I91 and head east on Rt 68.  <br/>
About 2 miles down the road and about 1/4 mile past the Wallingford/Durham <br/>
town line you will arrive at Rt 157 where you will find ample parking.  The <br/>
trail enters the woods about .1 mile west of Rt 157 (yes back the way you <br/>
came) on Rt 68, but you will be able to pick up the blue blazes right from <br/>
the parking area.  (You will be heading north on the trail).<br/>
<br/>
After entering the woods on the right the trail crosses railroad tracks and <br/>
then starts up hill. Follow the blazes carefully and faithfully.  There are <br/>
several trails that join, leave and sometimes short cut the trail. (Damned <br/>
ATVs, grumble grumble … Sorry).  At about 1.75 miles out (about 50 minutes at <br/>
2 mph) you will reach the Witches Den.  (You will know it when you see it.)  <br/>
If you haven’t reached the power lines, you haven’t gone far enough.  On the <br/>
way you will be treated to several warmly-lit wooded areas, interesting rocky <br/>
hills, nice cliff walks and a few "PUD"s.  (We will tell you what a PUD is <br/>
when you reach the box.)<br/>
<br/>
Now to find the letterbox. First, stand in the caldron.  Okay there is no <br/>
caldron… so stand where the caldron would be if there was a caldron.  And no, <br/>
if there is a fire going you don’t have to stand in the fire. Look 90 degrees <br/>
from magnetic north; in other words, stand with your back to Bristol Myers <br/>
(the big building in the middle of the view). You should see several <br/>
different rock outcroppings each looking like they would be good homes for <br/>
letterboxes in the hill you just came down.  Ours is just less than ½ way up <br/>
the hill.  It isn’t deeply hidden, just well enough so that when the witches <br/>
gather, they will have no idea that it is there.  After finding the box you <br/>
can take it back to the meeting area where you can have a seat while stamping <br/>
in. <br/>
<br/>
Now you have 2 choices.  Turn around and head back to your car (boring) or <br/>
continue forward past Powder Ridge Ski area to your friend’s car that you so <br/>
cleverly stashed at the Mount Higby parking lot on Rt 66.  It will be about <br/>
4.25 miles, but, you will get some awesome views along the way especially as <br/>
you do the ridge walk above Black Pond.<br/>
