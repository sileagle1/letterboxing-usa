Since 2004 Baby Bear and I have hosted an event at various parks around Texas and we plan to share many memories from them at this milestone event to be held at Buescher State Park in the beautiful Hill Country.  TALE is always on the first Saturday of March, normally a great time of year with cool weather, no mosquitoes and possibly some wildflowers blooming.  Buescher SP is not too far from Austin and San Antonio, great places to visit with fairly big airports for those coming from afar.  So if you ever want to visit Texas, this event would be a great time to do it.  Here are the websites with more information and I hope to see you then:<br/>
