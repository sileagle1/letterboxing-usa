Sleeping Giant State Park<br/>
3 Boxes Planted by Butterfly<br/>
<br/>
                              Around the Head of the Sleeping Giant<br/>
<br/>
With a map Of the Sleeping giant, this hike will be a dream.<br/>
       As the Giant sleeps, this hike goes across the top and around the<br/>
left side of his head,<br/>
then across his neck and around the right side of his head.   Have Fun<br/>
!!<br/>
       Begin on the Violet Trail off the picnic area to the west. Join<br/>
up with the red<br/>
diamond trail and the Mill River. When you come to a triple blazed tree<br/>
of blue, violet<br/>
and red, follow the Violet trail down to the rivers edge. Pick up a<br/>
small twig or leaf and<br/>
make a wish for a peaceful planet and release it free into the run of<br/>
the river.<br/>
        Return to the triple blazed tree and follow the Red Diamond<br/>
Trail as you climb up<br/>
to find the River Run Letterbox hidden on the trail high above. The Blue<br/>
Trail joins as<br/>
you continue to climb. When the blue Trail leaves and begins its climb<br/>
up the  head of<br/>
the Giant., stand there and notice a lonesome cedar tree at 240 degrees.<br/>
The River Run<br/>
Letterbox is at the west base of the cedar tree. Watch out for other<br/>
hikers watching you !!.<br/>
        Continue on the Red Diamond as it descends to the old quarry<br/>
site.It is now<br/>
beginning to heal with new growth. Turn right onto the Violet Trail<br/>
which climbs<br/>
northerly up and along the left side of the Giants head. Continue past<br/>
the two large cairns<br/>
on the left and  if you like, add a stone. Pass through mountain laurel<br/>
coming to lovely<br/>
beech trees. Stand by the two beech trees with a Violet blaze and many<br/>
wounds from<br/>
carvings.[?]. Take about 13 paces due north to an oak tree. The Purple<br/>
Flower Letterbox<br/>
is hidden at the base.  Continue on and watch carefully now  for the Red<br/>
Hexagon Trail<br/>
which is just after some large flat topped rocks. Turn right and hike up<br/>
the Red Hexagon<br/>
trail at 120 degrees as you travel across the Giants neck. Soon cross<br/>
the blue trail once<br/>
more, and come to the wide Tower Trail [no blazes]  It is all down hill<br/>
now as you walk<br/>
down the tower trail and the right side of the Giants head. The white<br/>
trail crosses the<br/>
tower trail and many people say this is where you feel the Giant<br/>
breathing, for in the<br/>
summer heat, it is always cool just about here.!!  Watch for the sharp<br/>
hairpin turn and<br/>
turn right onto the Orange Trail.at 260 degrees. The geen nature trail<br/>
also joins the<br/>
orange now. Continue down and then through laurel twisting and turning<br/>
as you descend.<br/>
When the Orange Trail turns right at yet another carved beech [poor<br/>
thing] notice a<br/>
gigantic oak tree just ahead on the left. --a Three Person Hug Tree --<br/>
give it a hug and<br/>
take 16 steps at 260 degrees to a three sister tree. The Pink Bird of<br/>
Fancy Letterbox is<br/>
nested in the middle. Continue on the Orange Trail crossing a bridge and<br/>
back to the park<br/>
road.  Hope you enjoyed the hike.<br/>
