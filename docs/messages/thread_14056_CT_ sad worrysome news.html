One thing that I have been told by police a couple of times (when some of our <br/>
visitors had their cars broken into) is to never leave anything in the <br/>
seating area of the car, but to put anything valuable into the trunk.<br/>
<br/>
They said that even if a purse or wallet is out of sight, robbers will often <br/>
still break in and reach around typical hiding areas (eg under the seat, in <br/>
the glove box or console), but that they will almost never break into the trunk.<br/>

I have a van with no trunk area, but I try to hide valuables under 'yucky' <br/>
things like used food wrappers, or in my box of car essentials like oil and <br/>
washer fluid.<br/>
<br/>
It is so infuriating that some folks are so brazen. All the break-ins I have <br/>
witnessed (when very upset people would come into the nature center asking to <br/>
call the police) were "smash and grab" type. The police said sometimes they <br/>
break in even when there are people nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I'm sorry for all the aggravation. I hope they catch the thief.<br/>
