I truly appreciate how all of you have been willing to input your ideas and be<br/>
a part of the creative process.  If the entire nation could operate with the<br/>
level of involvement that "Letterbox USA" has, this would truly be Utopia.<br/>
Thank you, everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I have recieved an outpouring of ideas and opinions regarding map selection<br/>
through the talk list and to my personal email address.  Here is a summary of<br/>
the input you have submitted...<br/>
<br/>
1)  The majority of group members are very pleased with our current maps.<br/>
Multicolored maps were definitely not popular, and the size of our current<br/>
maps seems to work well for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
2)  Most of you seemed to think that adding labels to the states was an idea<br/>
with merit.  The labels make it easier to select small states, and make the<br/>
map more user-friendly for kids, foreigners, and those of us who can't seem to<br/>
remember which is New Hampshire and which is Vermont.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Opinions were mixed on the subject of moving the State Contacts map to the<br/>
Group Mail page.  About as many of you liked the idea as opposed it.  In this<br/>
case, I guess the old addage, "If it's not broke, don't fix it" applies.<br/>
<br/>
In an attempt to incorporate everyone's preferences into a working model, I<br/>
have created a new set of maps.  They are exactly the same as the old ones,<br/>
except I have added labels similar to those on the multi-colored maps.<br/>
<br/>
Please take a look and tell me what you think.  If you approve, I will move<br/>
these over to the main page of the website.  They can be found at:<br/>

<br/>
Thanks again for your cooperation,<br/>
