pass on some updates.  We went looking for the two boxes in the<br/>
Washington Monument State Park in MD.  Two Grey Squirrel's box is in<br/>
great shape but the log book is almost full.<br/>
<br/>
See Joy's box (Spirit Walk) appears to be DOA.  We found the hiding<br/>
place mentioned in the clues (at least we are 99% sure it was the right<br/>
place) but didn't find the box.  At least not intact.  We found a box,<br/>
but no lid, stamp or log book.  We really hoped we are wrong, but an<br/>
exhaustive search of the area turned up no further evidence.<br/>
<br/>
A little bit of a disappointment to any otherwise great day, but I guess<br/>
that's all part of the experience.<br/>
