Dear Ms. Perkins,<br/>
<br/>
Hiya dollface.  Sorry I haven't written.  Not a lot going on on the case for a while but now it's starting to hop.  If you want the low down you'd better come yourself and scope it out.  <br/>
<br/>
Remember I told you all the corporate types are hiring fancy private dicks to solve Mr. Boddy's murder?  Well these guys are starting to show up. Detectives from New York, Las Vegas, even foreigners.  <br/>
<br/>
Was down at the train station yesterday and would you believe the Orient Express came in?  Yeah, caused quite a stir.  Then this fussy foreign guy gets off with a cane and a bowler hat.  Some Belgian private detective I'm told.  Wish you'd been there to get a picture. [Murder on the Orient Express by Scarab]  <br/>
<br/>
Now I hear they're going to have another product convention next month.  It'll get all those spokespeople back for the detectives to interview.  Those product logo guys are still the main suspects.  Picture the CSI guys dusting Arm &amp; Hammer's hammer while Cracker Jack walks by.  [CSI by Music Woman, Arm &amp; Hammer by Team King, Cracker Jack by various]<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow we local private detectives are going to talk about how we can work with the out of towners.  I'm meeting up with Bubbles Yablonsky and Inspector Nevis [by Knights of Colombo], Detective Grogue [by Gallant Rogue] and Honey West [by Sewsowbizzy].  <br/>
<br/>
I'll write you a big update after the meet up.  I'll make you a list of what's up.  <br/>
<br/>
Be careful out there sweetheart.<br/>
<br/>
Signed,<br/>
