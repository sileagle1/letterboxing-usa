                    <div class="plaintext-content">greetings Becky,  and welcome to letterboxing in Ohio! I can't wait <br/>
to see what boxes you plant. I hope you will post them to the LBNA <br/>
list or send me an email for the clues.<br/>
I just visited the Fort Ancient site. It is alive and well, and a <br/>
beautiful area.<br/>
No one has laid claim to the Ohio mystery box that I know of, <br/>
although a friend, and my son both say they think they know where it <br/>
might be.<br/>
There are three in the Cleveland area, but stay tuned, soon to be 2 <br/>
more. Where or how did you hear about letterboxing?- the bayboxer, <br/>

It sounds very fascinating. I have bought the supplies to plant a box. I<br/>
have some good ideas and was going to check out an area today, but you are<br/>
correct, this wind is awful. I didn't even walk my dogs tonight. I am in the<br/>
Northwest area of Ohio, close to MI and IN. My son lives in Lansing, MI. Are<br/>
there any boxes in that area? My son used to live in VA Beach and I see<br/>
there are lots of boxes there. Are all of the boxes listed on the internet<br/>

more.  (and I have only planted 7 of them!)  <br/>
And it is nice to be able to do a little letterboxing during your <br/>
travels.  You get to see parks and natural areas you might not <br/>
otherwise.<br/>

If you live in Ohio and would like a reporter to potentially <br/>
contact you about letterboxing, e-mail me off-list.<br/>
<br/>
If you live near Cincinnati/Oxford and would like to have a<br/>
mini-gathering the evening of Sat Mar 29th, e-mail me on or off-list.<br/>
<br/>
I also hope to be checking on my Ohio mystery box that weekend, which,<br/>
I guess, you can infer is somewhere between either an airport or <br/>
Chester County PA, and Oxford.<br/>

I set up a message board for each state at Atlas Quest.  Ohio is at<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/boards/boards.html?id=271 though I don't<br/>
think there's too many people from Ohio on the board as of yet.  I<br/>
don't know of any other Ohio letterboxing boards out there, either.<br/>

As an Ohioan, Ohio is included in the Great Lakes Letterboxing Yahoo Group - come join, keep me company!  I seem to be one of only 2 Ohioans on that list and could use more company.... :(<br/>
<br/>
Now that I've got your pity, Ohio is a funny state (as if the elections didn't show that enough....).  Being from Cleveland, of course I associate Ohio with the Great Lakes.  I know that letterboxing is more predominate in the South of the state, though, where the predominate water landmark is the Ohio River.  <br/>
<br/>
I did find this site, however, to unite Lake Erie &amp; Ohio River boxers:  http://www.imrisk.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl which isn't really a talk list or a forum, but still neat.<br/>

&gt; Watch it, Ryan, I hear there's a letterboxing sea monster named<br/>
&gt; Bessie that lives in Lake Erie....you want want her to come after<br/>
&gt; you once we find her? ;)<br/>
<br/>
Really?  I'd never heard of the Lake Erie monster.  Sounds like a good<br/>
idea for a letterbox if you ask me.  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; As an Ohioan, Ohio is included in the Great Lakes Letterboxing Yahoo<br/>
&gt; Group - come join, keep me company!  I seem to be one of only 2<br/>
&gt; Ohioans on that list and could use more company.... :(<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm not an Ohioans, so you'd still be only one of two Ohioans on<br/>
that list.  My whole experience with Ohio consists of driving through<br/>
on I-70 at a high rate of speed.  (Okay, I was probably 10 at the time<br/>
and it was my dad driving through at a high rate of speed while I<br/>
watched from the backseat.)  May have stopped at a gas station to pee<br/>
along the way, though it was so long ago I really don't remember where<br/>
the pit stops were.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, it's exhausting signing up and keeping track of all these<br/>
letterboxing groups!  So unless I actually have something to<br/>
contribute, I've stopped signing up for new Yahoo Groups a long time<br/>
ago....<br/>
<br/>
I don't know why everyone likes to make fun of Florida and Ohio. <br/>
Washington state is still trying to figure out who the next governor<br/>
will be.  *rolling eyes*  At least Florida and Ohio have already<br/>
figured out who their winners were!<br/>

***Well, if you ever venture out this way, maybe you can search for Bessie:  <br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=9595&amp;boxname=Bessie<br/>
<br/>
I figured out where she lives, just need to find some time to go hunt her down!<br/>

<br/>
New Straitsville, Ohio is a small town that is famous for two things: a fire burning since 1884 and 175 illegal moonshine stills. In 1884 a group of miners had a labor dispute. They sent a burning coal car into a mine with its endless supply of fuel. No more dispute. Lesson to be learned here is not to tick off the locals. During Prohibition stills ran in the hollers and mineshafts. The Straitsville Special was known in every speakeasy across the country. Lesson to be learned here is to stay on the good side of the locals. The Moonshine Festival has a working still and moonshine burgers, moonshine pie, and moonshine doggies. I anticipated a good time, but it didn't quite come out the way I planned. Don't get me wrong, the festival was great, but what is up with the ATF revenuers forbidding tasting of the hooch? As if that was not bad enough, none of the food included moonshine! Talk about misleading. <br/>
<br/>
The Scioto Trail State Park is located in the Scioto Trail State Forest. The Scioto Trail is the best hike for experiencing Ohio's untamed wilderness. Once a Shawnee trail it makes an 11.2-mile loop across the foothills and hollows. If the views aren't enough for you the morel mushrooms are abundant. <br/>
<br/>
I drove down to Chateau Laroche in Loveland, where chivalry is not dead. The Knights of the Golden Trail (K.O.G.T.) are insuring that valor, skill and manners live on. In their own words the purpose of K.O.G.T. is "to save modern civilization from degradation and degeneration, just as noble knights saved Europe from the Dark Ages." They welcome any man who believes in the ideals of the K.O.G.T. to join them. Silver Eagle, from what I was told, had joined their ranks in the not too distant past. The knights were much pleased to have such a gallant gentleman among them. Unfortunately he failed the rescuing fair maidens class. Seems he only believes in rescuing barefoot fair maidens from Texas. It was with heavy heart that the K.O.G.T. banned him from knighthood. But, I did not come here to talk about revenuers, mushrooms or chivalry; I came to talk letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Wow, Ohio, 1,400 something letterboxes! Not bad for a small state. Shame, Ohio, only 30 something mysteries. Can we talk percentages here? Maybe you should consider hiding mysteries instead of stills. Letterboxes are in good shape in the Buckeye State. Sturdy containers and mostly hand-carved stamps. Remember to keep them well covered; a covered box is a happy box. When hiking know your limits; don't try that 11.2 mile trail when you have only walked from your car to the local mall. Forest fires are deadly, so be careful with all flammable substances, especially in the spring and fall. Hunting is big in Ohio; wear orange during hunting season. Think safety.  <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
<br/>
