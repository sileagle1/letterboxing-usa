We snowshoe too, and even though we only find about half the boxes we look for in the snowy winter, it doesn't take the pleasure out <br/>
of hunting for them!   I LOVE the snow-blanketed woods, especially when it's fresh or still snowing and its covering all the branches.  <br/>
Ahhh.<br/>

I have never been motivated enough to try snowshoes, but I've boxed with you and you aren't too insane.  I'm wondering if Dan and I (or maybe just I) came up your way to grab some of those shirts we talked about, maybe you might want to show me the basics of snowshoeing?  I am afraid that I am becoming a fuddyduddy and not getting out much at all. A trip to see you, grab a box or two, and see if snowshoes are something I will not spaz out on would be very good for my inner child. Email me if you are interested!
