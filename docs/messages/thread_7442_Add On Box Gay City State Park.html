Rated: Easy<br/>
Location: Gay City State Park<br/>
Planted By: Pink Trotters, with the help of Leader of the Pack, <br/>
Butterfly &amp; Angel<br/>
<br/>
This box was planted in honor of Sonora Webster Carver who rode the <br/>
diving horses in Atlantic City, New Jersey. (She would ride the horse <br/>
as it jumped from a 40-foot tower into a tank of water.)  She has <br/>
written an autobiography called "A girl and five brave horses" and <br/>
there is a 1991 Disney move "Wild Heart's Can't Be Broken" about her <br/>
life. This is a very inspiring story about a young woman who <br/>
overcomes tremendous odds. <br/>
<br/>
This box can be found in Gay City state park. It is on the trail <br/>
between the other two boxes in that park. After collecting an image <br/>
at box 1 continue on down the trail.  On the trail come to a bend in <br/>
the road where a tree sits on top of a large rock. In front of you, <br/>
you can see glimpses of the pond and a stonewall. Take a bearing of <br/>
80 degrees and walk in that direction. You will come to a tree, the <br/>
box is under a rock behind that tree. This is a busy part of the <br/>
trail so please be discrete and rehide the box well. Thanks!<br/>
