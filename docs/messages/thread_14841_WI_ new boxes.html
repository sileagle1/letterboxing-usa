as well as launching our first hitchhiker.  They are up and running, all<br/>
clues located on the letterboxing website.<br/>
<br/>
One is a mystery box, the second is located at Pioneer Village in Saukville<br/>
(where our hitchhiker "Schoolhouse Rocks" also waits to begin it's journey<br/>
with it's first finder!), and then there is a three stamp series that has<br/>
been planted at Riveredge near Newburg.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!<br/>
