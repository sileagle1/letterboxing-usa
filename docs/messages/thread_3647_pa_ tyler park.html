                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today was very exciting for me.  I went to visit my two boxes at Tyler<br/>
State Park (planted in May) and found that it had 8 visitors!!!<br/>
I also wanted to remind everyone that my other box at Tyler Park<br/>
(Schofield Ford Covered Bridge) floated away in the flooding we had<br/>
earlier this year.  Hopefully it will be re-placed this Friday, provided<br/>
I can get my school work finished.  So keep a look out for it.  I'm<br/>
counting this box as a replacement since I will try to replicate the<br/>
stamp and place it in the same general vicinity, just on higher ground.<br/>
