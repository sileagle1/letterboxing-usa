 The message below was sent out tonight. We thought that the more people<br/>

help him make it thought the night. When we left the Hospital at 11pm he was still <br/>

 At around 10am this morning, A group from SWOGO were coming <br/>
home from Dayton after the rain had started. A truck went into a <br/>
skid and smashed into 3 cars. 2 of these cars carried our friends <br/>
and 1 of those cars did not make it very well. As you are getting <br/>
this, We were already told that we may not get very good news <br/>
tonight.  If you do get a chance, Please lend some moral support on <br/>
the link above or keep them in your thoughts. <br/>
<br/>
 We will keep everyone updated on what is going on as soon as <br/>
we hear something. <br/>
