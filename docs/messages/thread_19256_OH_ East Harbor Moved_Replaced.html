                    <div class="plaintext-content">Went out to check on our East Harbor State Park box which we <br/>
planted in April 03. I received recent reports that the entire tree <br/>
was missing. Unfortunately, I don't know if the box or the tree are <br/>
still there. Let me explain. <br/>
<br/>
In April, this trail looked like a perfect location. Signs indicated <br/>
that snowmobiles were welcome, so we assumed it was <br/>
accessible year round. We were excited about placing our first <br/>
box there. <br/>
<br/>
What we neglected to put into persepective is that the trail is a <br/>
"wetlands" trail. Knowing the area, I wasn't concerned, I <br/>
assumed it meant there were lots of cat  tails and ocassional <br/>
mud. <br/>
<br/>
When I showed up, the grass leading to the trail was a little <br/>
mushy. I got about halfway to the rotting tree, and the water and <br/>
mud was so deep I had to stop. I decided to come back the next <br/>
day after a lot of sunshine. The next day the water and mud was <br/>
still totally unpassable! (I even wore sandals, hoping to traipse <br/>
through the mud barefoot. It was too deep.) The number of <br/>
mosquitoes was also unbearable.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, I made a totally new box (with an existing <br/>
stamp) and placed it on a different trail in the park. Blackberry <br/>
trail to be exact. There was no mud, fewer mosquitoes but a little <br/>
poison ivy. Though the instructions are not as fun, at least the <br/>
box is accessible, and I think I found the one spot that can be <br/>
reached without getting a nasty rash.<br/>
