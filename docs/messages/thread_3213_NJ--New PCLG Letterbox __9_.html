Box #9: Coward?<br/>
Location: Somewhere in New Jersey<br/>
Difficulty: 3/5 stars; Easy hike; 1 hour from parking lot to box.<br/>
Placed 05/28/2001<br/>
Clue page: http://www.pcdx.com/pclg/clue9.htm<br/>
<br/>
"I manoeuvered my antagonists from their advantageous ground <br/>
into as disadvantageous a one...without losing a single gun, a <br/>
single color, or sacrificing a single batallion." Sir Henry Clinton <br/>
and Samuel Adams agreed with this man that his decision was <br/>
the correct one, yet he was found guilty.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the place where this man ordered his troops to retreat.<br/>
<br/>
Start between the flagpoles. Take the path that borders the <br/>
woods at 290 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
When you come to a fork in the road, where the gravel path goes <br/>
left and the tire tracks go right, take the option at 280 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
When you can make a right, make it. Then, take the next left. <br/>
Then, choose blue.<br/>
<br/>
You'll come to a clearing. Standing at the brown metal post, walk <br/>
to the rocky bridge at 317 degrees. Then, standing in the center <br/>
of the bridge, walk 8 paces due east; you'll see a tree on your left. <br/>
The box is under some branches next to the tree; please replace <br/>
them carefully!<br/>
<br/>
To get out of the woods, stand at the pole and take the trail to the <br/>
south. Keep going straight and stay on the main trail; then go <br/>
straight into the woods; the path will lead you home.<br/>
