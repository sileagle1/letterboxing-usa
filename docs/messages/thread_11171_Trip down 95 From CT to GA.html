                    <div class="plaintext-content">After you get into NC, there are several that I know of that are<br/>
within a 10 or 15 minute drive on one side or another of I-85 in<br/>
Davidson County and in Rowan County. I have found all of these and<br/>
would recommend them to you! <br/>
<br/>
We personally planted the Frog Prince letterbox in Salisbury, NC<br/>
(Rowan County) and it is very easy to get to, as is the Dan's Hikers<br/>
letterbox which was planted by our good friend TrailSeeker; both are<br/>
in parks and are easily accessable.<br/>
<br/>
The letterboxes in Davidson County (Outside of Lexington, near<br/>
Spencer) are in a wooded area and will require an hour or so of<br/>
tramping around in the woods (there are THREE boxes there in the same<br/>
State Park!). Be aware that the Boone's Cave State Park has been<br/>
closed, but you can still park outside the gate and walk the 1/2 mile<br/>
down the drive to the park and still search for the boxes. In fact,<br/>
it's even better this way because it decreases the chance of the boxes<br/>
being accidentally found and gives you the park all to yourself! It's<br/>
a beautiful place!<br/>

The Bryan Park box in Richmond, VA is right off I-95 as it goes<br/>
through Richmond. Once in the park, the box is no more than a<br/>
30-minute walk and then maybe 20 minutes back to your car.<br/>
