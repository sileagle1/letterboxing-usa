The status of Fairy Pool Letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
I searched for the box on Saturday and found it after a bit of brookside hiking!  It is a neat location once you determine the correct stream.  Unfortunately, the weather was not very kind to the box.  It was completely filled up with blue tinted water.  Everything was completely soaked.  The book and accompanying info was in bad, really bad shape.  I dried things off as well as I could and made a temporary book.  It looked like it had been a long time since anyone had been there.  Could the owner stop by and check on it sometime?<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails, <br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I looked for the box today and I had no luck.  I followed the stream <br/>
down to the old beaver pond, but I couldn't recognize any of the <br/>
landmarks mentioned in the clues.  The only thing I saw was a 4 foot <br/>
wooden stake with an orange top.  This stream widens out when it is <br/>
full of water, so its location is variable.<br/>
<br/>
I met a couple cooling their feet in the fairy pool.  They said that <br/>
the state breached the beaver dam and that changed the whole <br/>
appearance of the area.<br/>
<br/>
The planter's email address is not on the group member list.  Maybe <br/>
they are not active anymore.<br/>
