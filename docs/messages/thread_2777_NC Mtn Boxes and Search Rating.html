<br/>
I think I'll give two sets of times - tortoise and hare.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, our 10k loop on Mt. Mitchell (the highest point east of the <br/>
Rockies at 6,684') takes me 5 1/2 hours to do.  I am no couch potato, but I <br/>
do admit to being a 48-year old overweight lover of cheeseburgers.  My <br/>
husband and his grandsons (all of them jocks) can do it in 2 1/2 hours.  The <br/>
letterbox will be planted next week.  No one will have to do the whole 10k <br/>
to find it.<br/>
<br/>
Two more boxes will be seeded in the next two weeks - one on the Blue Ridge <br/>
Parkway at Crabtree Meadows, and one near the Joyce Kilmer Memorial Forest <br/>
in the Nantahala Mountains.<br/>

    Good to hear that there'll be letterboxes in that area.  I <br/>
climbed Mt. Mitchell perhaps 15 years ago, but maybe I'll be tempted <br/>
to do it again, next time I'm down that way - fall or spring.<br/>
    By the way, are you acquainted with the nearby Celo Community ?  <br/>
Have a long-time friend there, living quite near Mt. Mitchell.<br/>
<br/>
                        Regards,          Bob / Cock o' the Trail<br/>

placing. Im on the east southern coast between Wilmington and Myrtle <br/>
Beach. And found my first box in this area. But there are no others <br/>
here. It takes 4 hours to get to the next closest box to me. I am <br/>
going to plant a few boxes here, I'm working on the locations and <br/>
clues now. I hope to see many people come and find them and I am <br/>
planning a trip to the daniels park box in the next few months. Glad <br/>
to see everyone keeping busy. <br/>
Lovely Days,<br/>
