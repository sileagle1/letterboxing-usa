Stampers Big Well letterbox in Greensburg, Kansas is missing. <br/>
<br/>
Very happy to report that Waconda Lake and Wilson Lake boxes are in <br/>
fine shape, beautifully carved (how does he do that?), and well <br/>
hidden.  My group was the first to find Lake Wilson letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
In case Der Mad Stamper is reading, I went to Cedar Bluff and didn't <br/>
have time for a good search, so I can't report on that one, but I<br/>
have never seen any place in Kansas as beautiful as that.  What a <br/>
view.  Can't wait for my next trip to the inlaws (I've never said<br/>
that before) to search out the rest of your boxes.  Thanks so much for <br/>
making mine a memorable trip.  I have planted a few more in KS and <br/>
will be posting them as soon as I return home. rtrw<br/>
