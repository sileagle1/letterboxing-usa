Planted August 24th 2002<br/>
Tyro, Nelson County, "Central" Va<br/>
Difficulty- A good long hike on uneven but marked and<br/>
maintained terrain.<br/>
<br/>
Driving directions: From Richmond (as a general<br/>
starting point) take 64 west to 29 south. Then take 56<br/>
west untill you reach Crabtree Falls Highway, there is<br/>
a green sign telling you to turn left. The upper<br/>
entrance is about 4 miles past the lower entrance on<br/>
the left.<br/>
<br/>
Crabtree Falls Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Hike down the trail from the top of the fall,<br/>
Beautiful overlooks, visit them all.<br/>
<br/>
Before reaching last view, which is paved in white<br/>
Is what you seek, at not a great height.<br/>
<br/>
Watch the handrail, it knows when to stop,<br/>
Walk on the white, is too far, your odds go "plop".<br/>
<br/>
Look for twin grandfathers on your right, <br/>
About four feet apart, always in t'others sight.<br/>
<br/>
Twixt these grand brothers rests some stone<br/>
Behind the middle one I make my home.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The lower entrance to Crabtree Falls is currently<br/>
closed while an expanded parking lot and restroom<br/>
facility are being constructed. It is posted "No<br/>
Parking" and "Closed" for the safety of the workers<br/>
and the public. Please DO NOT bother them. Therefore,<br/>
my instructions are from the top of the falls, which<br/>
is a long but beautiful hike. The road to the top end<br/>
is a little "unfinished" but maintained, high ground<br/>
clearance is recomended. The nearest campground is<br/>
www.crabtreefallscampground.com, which is perfectly<br/>
wonderful! Box is within 2 feet of the trail, we shall<br/>
see how long it lasts, but I was concerned about<br/>
damage to the vegitation. Diana helped me plant it,<br/>
she left a special treat!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
