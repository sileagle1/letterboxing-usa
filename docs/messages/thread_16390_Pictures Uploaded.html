I would not click on this. I think that this is another one of those <br/>
worms or some such. Wish we could get the moderators to at least <br/>
check the first post to the board. Probably not feasible.<br/>

I was a dumba$$ and clicked it. It just takes you to yahoo and <br/>
says "page not found", then you get an advertisement for a vacation <br/>
or some kinda crap like that. Don't people have better things to do <br/>
with their time than post this junk? *rolls eyes*  <br/>
Just think, they could be out letterboxing instead. ;)<br/>

Run a scan on your computer for tracking bugs and such. I would bet <br/>
that you now have some unexpected visitors. <br/>
<br/>
If you do not have the software to check this, go up to CNET.com and <br/>
search the downloads area for SPYBOT smashers.<br/>
<br/>
Just like you, I hate this sort of dreck!<br/>

I'd love to set something like that up for the Pacific Northwest <br/>
board (I have special powers there *wink*), but alas, I fear you are <br/>
correct and it's not feasile.  It appears that on these boards, you <br/>
can set it up so all messages must be reviewed before posting, or <br/>
none.<br/>
<br/>
On second thought, forcing all messages to go through a 'review' <br/>
would certainly have saved myself some trouble in the not too distant <br/>
past.  =)<br/>
<br/>
In any case, it's a good reminder: Be careful of links from unknown <br/>
persons.<br/>

I have a correction to make in my last post--it DOES appear to be <br/>
feasible now that I've looked into it more.  There's a feature <br/>
to "moderate", which I thought was basically a yes-or-no option, but <br/>
it turns out there's a yes, no, and new members only option.  I'm not <br/>
exactly sure what counts as a "new member" and the help screens are <br/>
woefully inadequit for answering such simple questions.  After the <br/>
first post are they no longer a new member?  Or after they've been a <br/>
member for a month?  I don't have a clue!<br/>
<br/>
But for kicks, I turned it on and plan to use another account to see <br/>
how it works and whether it's of any use or not.  Hopefully we've got <br/>
another strike against spammers and other folks with malicious <br/>
thoughts in mind.<br/>
<br/>
Carpe diem!<br/>
