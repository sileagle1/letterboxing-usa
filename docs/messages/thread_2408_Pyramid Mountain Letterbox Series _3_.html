Pyramid Mountain Natural Historical Area<br/>
Placed by Wingfoot on 05/28/01<br/>
Montville, Morris County, New Jersey<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Easy<br/>
Terrain:    Moderately Easy with a steep climb<br/>
Time:     Approximately 1 1/2 - 2 hours <br/>
<br/>
Please be discreet, as some areas of this park are heavily traveled.<br/>
<br/>
Established after a lengthy grassroots effort to preserve the area from <br/>
development, the Pyramid Mountain Natural Historic Area is over a thousand <br/>
acres of open space rich in natural and historical resources. <br/>
<br/>
The broad mountains, flat-topped ridges and narrow valleys of Pyramid <br/>
Mountain are not only beautiful but also vital in feeding downstream <br/>
reservoirs, supplying needed aquifers and supporting flora and fauna. The <br/>
wide variety of natural habitats found within Pyramid Mountain include <br/>
fields, forests, streams, swamps, and ponds, which support a number of plants <br/>
considered uncommon to New Jersey as well as threatened and endangered plants <br/>
and animals. Bears, snakes, foxes, and bobcats have all been seen in the <br/>
park.  Historically, Pyramid Mountain is important for its lessons about the <br/>
Lenape Indians, who flourished in this area, and the early European settlers, <br/>
who came to the area to take advantage of its rich natural resources. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This hike takes you through the park and highlights some significant areas.<br/>
<br/>
PYRAMID MOUNTAIN LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
Begin at the parking area across from Mars Court.  If a map is available take <br/>
one. Take and follow the blue trail.  The blue trail forks before a walk over <br/>
bridge, take the fork west over the bridge.  If you come to a road, you've <br/>
taken the wrong fork.  Follow blue trail until you see the start of the white <br/>
trail. Take and follow the white trail.  After the trail reenters woods <br/>
you'll see the ruins of the Morgan place on the right.  Next you'll come to <br/>
the start of the red trail, take the trail heading north, not the red trail.  <br/>
You will come to a gigantic boulder on the left of the path.  This is Bear <br/>
Rock.  It is a glacial erratic.  Take the blue trail heading north.  When you <br/>
come to the intersection of the blue and red/white blaze trails look for a <br/>
sign on a tree pointing you to the "Visitor's center".  Take 3 paces <br/>
northeast from that tree with the sign.  There will be a downed tree.  Follow <br/>
tree uphill to its stump.  Under a pile of rocks, at the tree's stump, is <br/>
what you are searching for.<br/>
<br/>
WHALE HEAD ROCK LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
Now take the red/white trail.  Watch out for stepping on the orange <br/>
salamanders here. There is a steep rocky climb along the trail.  Once you <br/>
reach the top continue along the trail.  On the right you'll see a massive <br/>
boulder.  After passing the boulder continue along trail.  You'll see a <br/>
red/white blaze directing you to a left turn.  From the tree with that blaze <br/>
you'll be able to see a big split tree behind a rock at 130 degrees.  Take 25 <br/>
paces to that tree.  From tree take 16 paces at 60 degrees.  There will be a <br/>
stump with a pile of rocks behind it; within the pile of rocks is what you're <br/>
searching for.    <br/>
<br/>
TRIPOD ROCK LETTERBOX  <br/>
<br/>
Now continue along red/white trail going the way you didn't come.  You'll <br/>
eventually pass the Whale Head Rock on the right.  When you come to the white <br/>
trail take the south fork.  Continue along white trail until you come to <br/>
Tripod Rock. Tripod Rock, perched on a bluff, this megalith seems like a <br/>
freak of nature, its 140-ton boulder resting precariously atop three small <br/>
rock feet. Geologists believe a receding glacier created it some 18,000 years <br/>
ago during the Ice Age. Some super naturalists suspect it was an Indian <br/>
version of Stonehenge, used to pinpoint the summer solstice. (Reportedly some <br/>
devotees gather each June 21 at sunset to burn candles and beat drums in <br/>
tribute.)  The planter of this box has not taken in part in these ceremonies. <br/>
 After examining Tripod Rock continue along white trail.  When you come to <br/>
the blue trail, take the south fork.  Eventually you'll come to the <br/>
blue/white trail on your right.  If you want to take a quick detour for an <br/>
overlook take this trail to the end and you'll arrive at Lucy's overlook.  <br/>
Enjoy view and when done continue along blue trail.  Blue trail meets up with <br/>
yellow trail.  Take the merged blue/yellow trail.  When trail splits, take <br/>
blue trail once again.  Eventually you'll come to an overlook on the left of <br/>
this trail.  Enjoy the view.  Once back on blue trail you'll shortly come to <br/>
yet another overlook.  Just before the overlook there will be a big rock with <br/>
a blue blaze on the right of the trail.  From the rock take 4 paces at 330 <br/>
degrees.  Underneath a rock outcrop there, is what you're searching for.  Use <br/>
a stick, just in case.<br/>
<br/>
Continue down hill on blue trail to parking lot.         <br/>
