<p>Aboard Surprise</p>
<p>Hamilton Roads</p>
<p>My dear Sir Joseph,</p>
<p>It is with great distress that I write, dashing this note off to send with the homeward bound packet, the master's mate fairly snapping with haste to make his tide. I am afraid to tell you that we have lost Dr Maturin. He had gone ashore several times as my political advisor and, with the seaman-like attendance of my coxswain had managed quite well. But now I must tell you that they have not returned from their latest foray.</p>
<p>I am concerned that the Doctor may have been double crossed by the French, who are quite enthusiastic in the local area. </p>
<p>As is his lifelong habit, Dr Maturin has been writing constantly in his diary, often late into the night and until his eyes are streaming red from the effort. As it is writ quite small and in a cypher that neither I nor Jacob can make out, I am forwarding it to you for your examination. Any help you can offer in decyphering Stephen's whereabouts would be most appreciated.</p>
<p>Your most affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p>Jno Aubrey</p>
