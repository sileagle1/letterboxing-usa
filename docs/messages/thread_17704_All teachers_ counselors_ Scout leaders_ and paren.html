 I am trying to find out how to present letterboxing to all students. I would like to see how you worked it in your planners, what age groups you worked with, what you would have done differently, what tools did you allow them to use for carving, did you use store bought stamps, were there troubles taking the kids out ot plant and how close to school or church did you go,  who wrote up the clues, I am looking for detail, I love details. I need the whole scoop!! The more the better.<br/>

<br/>
We have a master plan for introducing letterboxing to<br/>
our scout den!<br/>
<br/>
A few months ago, we took them camping and my daughter<br/>
and I went a few days ahead of time and planted five<br/>
boxes (Silver Eagle and BabyBear both have boxes<br/>
planted in the place we were camping, but we didn't<br/>
want to break the boys in on "real" boxes).  We made<br/>
clues with a combination of visual hints, compass<br/>
readings, and paces.  Instead of stamps, we put<br/>
stickers in the boxes and little notebooks for them to<br/>
sign in to.  This narrowed it down to only the hunt<br/>
and find.  Once they earn their whittling chip, we'll<br/>
help them carve their own stamps and we'll take them<br/>
out again.  We may do a soap carving first, but BSA is<br/>
very specific about how and when boys can use knives,<br/>
so we need to brush up on how the rules read and how<br/>
light carvings are done before we decide about that. <br/>
We'll probably play with our practice boxes again when<br/>
they learn to stamp, and when we feel they are<br/>
trustworthy with "live ammo" and "real targets", we'll<br/>
take them to find some real boxes.  When we took them<br/>
a few months ago, my daughter and I stationed<br/>
ourselves centrally to the boxes and were available to<br/>
help them with clues that got past them.  We didn't<br/>
immediately tell them where to find boxes, but gave<br/>
them helpful hints.  In one case, I was on the trail<br/>
very near to BabyBear's box when a team came through,<br/>
so I removed it (out of sight) and showed them the<br/>
box, letting them know it had been hidden very near<br/>
where they were.  They were completely enthralled with<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm talking about second grade boys for your<br/>
reference.<br/>

Hey there Dragon Lady,<br/>
<br/>
I'm a Girl Scout leader and trainer<br/>
<br/>
I've taken a few of the families of my 5th grade Juniors out letterboxing and have <br/>
presented it as a fun family activity for getting out in the wilderness and have a good <br/>
time.  Now that several of the girls are doing it, we've talked about creating stamps as <br/>
part of the "Art in 3D" badge, but I don't actually take the girls out letterboxing <br/>
myself.<br/>
<br/>
The 9th grade cadette troop (only 3 girls) is completely into it.  We started out <br/>
searching for local boxes with store bought personal stamps and have since created <br/>
our own stamps (out of fun foam glued to a block).  Of the three girls, two have gone <br/>
out with their families to letterbox as well.<br/>
<br/>
My friend and fellow trainer and I are also planning a carving workshop for older girls <br/>
and adults.  Our plans are to carve and hide stamps  relating to GS events on our Girl <br/>
Scout properties and at daycamp.  We would only give out the clues to scouts (since <br/>
these properties are not open to the public.) Our workshop is planned for next <br/>
October and by the time that rolls around we expect to have at least 6 "official" Scout <br/>
stamps hidden.  This way we figure that we'll share the sport in a limited way and then <br/>
anyone who really gets into it will probably go that extra step to find letterboxing,org <br/>
on their own!<br/>

most of my kids with "real" boxes due to the vandalism issue. Also, <br/>
we're in a city (Philadelphia) which makes it hard to transport the <br/>
kids to and from boxes, as most are in the 'burbs.<br/>
<br/>
However, when it gets warmer, I'll be working in collaboration with <br/>
one of the History teachers when he goes on a field trip to Valley <br/>
Forge National Park. I'm going to create boxes just for that class <br/>
trip, hide them myself the day of the trip, and then remove them when <br/>
we leave. That way it'll be more fun and interactive than just a <br/>
regular guided tour of the park. Additionally, I'll tell the kids <br/>
that if they're interested in learning more about the hobby, they can <br/>
come speak to me personally after the trip - that way I hope to weed <br/>
out the disinterested ones and/or potential vandals.<br/>

Our den made stamps out of the foam material and a<br/>
pair of scissors. Most of the bous used either their<br/>
name or their initials. This is a safe alternative to<br/>
using a knife for carving.<br/>
The foan was cut out and then glued to a piece of<br/>
cardboard. A cork was also glued to the back so they<br/>
had something to hold on to when stamping.<br/>
