                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, lady, you really know how to hurt a guy. Speaking<br/>
out in a public forum in regards to our payment<br/>
arrangement is not what I would consider very kosher.<br/>
What do you have to say about yourself on this one?<br/>
<br/>
Just for your information, dogs can be of much benefit<br/>
here. Ever hear of Dude the Wonder Dog and his<br/>
sidekick Hikers &amp; Hounds? Bet the Dude could find<br/>
anything! Word has it that he finds the letterboxes,<br/>
not the H&amp;H. She is too busy trying to set the world,<br/>
or at least New Jersey, on fire. <br/>
<br/>
On second thought, this shady pair could very well be<br/>
responsible for a crime of this magnitude. Hikers &amp;<br/>
Hounds, the diabolical duo! If this is the case, I am<br/>
afraid the Store might be up in smoke. The Dude, well,<br/>
he would cover his own tracks in this matter. Perhaps<br/>
I can get him to howl out a few words. How much do<br/>
doggie treats cost these days? Here doggie doggie,<br/>
dessert is ready. <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
<br/>
