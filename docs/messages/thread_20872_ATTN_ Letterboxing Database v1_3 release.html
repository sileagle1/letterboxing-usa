I want to thank all of you who provided feedback on my database <br/>
development. It has been a labor of love but I'm glad to get this <br/>
monkey off my back! I posted v1.3 under the files section of this <br/>
newsgroup.<br/>
<br/>
Included is a README.TXT file that will give you some basic <br/>
information on what it can do and how to use it. Feel free to use it; <br/>
I hope that some of you will try it out. -hexacat<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Some of the functionality is listed below:<br/>
&gt; PFX count (of course!) with the "PFXHE" nomenclature<br/>
&gt; PFX Log Book<br/>
&gt; Maintenance Log Book (this will include any boxes you adopted)<br/>
&gt; Hitchhiker Log Book<br/>
&gt; Event Log Book<br/>
&gt; Contact Database<br/>
&gt; Statistic Page<br/>
&gt; Export to MS Excel<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The PFX Log book can be sorted by ascending/descending order of any <br/>
&gt; field you choose (date, placer, Box name, Location, etc.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Maintenance module will keep track of all the maintenance done <br/>
&gt; (or needs to be done) on each box planted and/or adopted. Currently <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; am working on a sort by "county" feature that will print out a list <br/>
&gt; of boxes planted in a specific area. I think it will help you <br/>
&gt; organize your maintenance weekends by local.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Hitchhiker module will keep track of all your hitchhiker <br/>
travels <br/>
&gt; for each box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Events module simply lists all your events attended (nothing <br/>
&gt; fancy here).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Contact module will allow you to build a list of fellow boxers <br/>
&gt; detailing their trail name (sorry, no multiple personalities <br/>
&gt; allowed!) mailing address, phone, email, and a list of their boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The statistic module will give you a breakdown on your success rate <br/>
&gt; according to your attempts vs. number of finds. Also being <br/>
developed <br/>
&gt; is a breakdown of the types of boxes (postal, virtual, and personal <br/>
&gt; travelers collected). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The big question is: what am I missing and what would other users <br/>
&gt; want have in a functional database????<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please contact me if you would like to be added to the distribution <br/>
&gt; list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; thanks, Hexacat<br/>
