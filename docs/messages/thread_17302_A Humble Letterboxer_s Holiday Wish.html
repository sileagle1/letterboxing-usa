<br/>
This has been quite a great year for us both! Last December 29th, I <br/>
began a <br/>
website of my own to test the waters and see if there was any <br/>
interest in this <br/>
pastime that had taken over every available free thought in my head! <br/>
<br/>
Here we are, a year later and our website has had almost 16,000 hits, <br/>
and has <br/>
been visited by letterboxers from all over the US and 34 countries <br/>
around the <br/>
world! Never in my wildest dreams has we envisioned such a reception. <br/>
We are <br/>
even getting a group of letterboxers together for a trip to Dartmoor <br/>
National <br/>
Park in England in late September 2004 [Email me if you are <br/>
interested!]<br/>
<br/>
Our heartfelt thanks go to you, our friends, who have supported us <br/>
and the <br/>
website as it has chugged along. Never have we met a more caring, <br/>
wonderful <br/>
group of people.<br/>
<br/>
In this most special time of year, our wish for you is the best that <br/>
the <br/>
holidays can offer: the warmth of a cozy fire surrounded by those you <br/>
love!<br/>
May you find peace in the season and many first finds in the New Year!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
<br/>
