&gt;I understand the dilemna, but I'm also concerned about boxes that may still<br/>
&gt;be active that could be lost simply because someone isn't following the list<br/>
&gt;and hasn't taken the effort to claim boxes yet.  The boxes are still<br/>
&gt;scattered enough out here that it is a real loss to lose any active boxes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yikes!  I've been away for the past few weeks due to a move (and a phone <br/>
line from hades, but we just won't go there), and this is the first digest <br/>
I've seen.<br/>
<br/>
Are we getting rid of people's clues on the site if they're not <br/>
"claimed"?  I know for a while, people didn't even have to be a member of <br/>
the list in order to post clues, so that seems a little rash to me.  I know <br/>
my boxes in Washington have all been adopted by other people while I'm <br/>
exiled out here in the middle of nowhere, but eeegh, y'know?<br/>
<br/>
I did an archive search but can't find this initiating thread.  Where do we <br/>
go to report status changes to our clues?<br/>
