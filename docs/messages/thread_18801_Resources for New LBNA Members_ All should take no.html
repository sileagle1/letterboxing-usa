<br/>
We've recently been discussing with a few other moderators how to <br/>
best assist the new members with their questions as they join <br/>
this 'big list'.  We realize that some of the more experienced <br/>
members might get annoyed by seeing the same questions over and over <br/>
again, however these questions are part of the learning process; the <br/>
rate at which letterboxing continues to blossom means that these <br/>
questions will continue and the information will need to continually <br/>
be disseminated. <br/>
<br/>
In an effort to reduce the amount of flames thrown across the list we <br/>
have created a collection in the links section of this group <br/>
entitled "A collection of resources for new letterboxers".  Please <br/>
check out this section and bookmark it in your web browser. (Link at <br/>
bottom of message, or click "links" on the left side of the group <br/>
screen).  <br/>
<br/>
We would encourage folks to do the following when a new member posts <br/>
questions that you feel can be answered with a standard answer (such <br/>
as a simple definition), etc: <br/>
   *Reply to the post, but direct it towards that member's email &amp;<br/>
   *Refer them to the links section,<br/>
   *or Answer the question privately,<br/>
   *or Provide them with the tools to find the answer,<br/>
   *or take note of this message # and supply that # to them! <br/>
<br/>
We hope that this may eliminate some of the flame wars on here, <br/>
answer the question being posed, and show members where to get <br/>
further information should they need help. Please feel free to add <br/>
links to the folder if you find another web page that may be helpful! <br/>

<br/>
I was thinking maybe someone (or more than one someone) on the list might <br/>
want to volunteer to be the designated "newbie answerer," so that person (or <br/>
team) would take on the responsibility for sending a message offering the website <br/>
URLs with the FAQs.   The newbie would then get their answer, and the rest of <br/>
the list could just ignore the question, without having to fill up everyone's <br/>
mailboxes with the same old arguments we've heard before.<br/>
