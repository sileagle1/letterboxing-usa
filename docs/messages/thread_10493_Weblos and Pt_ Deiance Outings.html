(Nailhead) for his warm welcome to the great Northwest<br/>
on my recent visit there.  The day with the scouts<br/>
took me back more than a few years. I was nice to meet<br/>
the boys and the dads and spend some hours tramping<br/>
back and forth through the woods, despite the rain.<br/>
<br/>
As an added bonus Chuck arraigned for a mini-gathering<br/>
at Point Defiance park in Tacoma where I had the<br/>
chance to put some faces with the stamps I have seen<br/>
in my boxing around the area. It was truly wonderful<br/>
to meet up with such warm and friendly folks so far<br/>
from home.  Shows what a great hobby this is.<br/>
<br/>
My special thanks to Alafair for being my long<br/>
distance partner and creating such a wonderful stamp<br/>
and log book for the scouts.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to the Nails and all the South Sound<br/>
boxers who add something special to my trips west.<br/>
