Lucy, <br/>
I think you may have unintentionally misled the man you met based on your
own misunderstanding. Geocachers "don't disturb the earth" any
more than letterboxers do. The two hobbies are extremely similar. The
content of the boxes is usually different (though not always) and the
clues to finding them are often different but
_the_way_the_boxes_are_hidden_is_identical_. <br/>
The way people search for the box once they get to the general area of
the box is also identical. <br/>
Geocachers are not a shovel brigade carelessly digging up the woods. They
don't turn over more rocks than letterboxers. They don't do anything
substantially different than what you do.<br/>
<br/>
There are simply more of them. <br/>
<br/>
The same rules of etiquette are followed by both groups. <br/>
The same issues of concern that the National Park Service has with regard
to one apply to the other. Both are prohibited in National Parks. <br/>
If anything, geocache locations can be more closely
observed/approved/regulated by Park Rangers than letterboxes because of
the universality of the clue format (lat./lon.). <br/>
I personally like the varying levels of difficulty and obscurity that
letterbox clues allow and the artistic aspect of stamping but thought I'd
put in my 2 cents regarding the misperception of geocachers as
enviromental heathens.<br/>

<body><b>Lucy,</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am with Eoghan here.  I originally
started out letterboxing and have since incorporated geocaching as well. 
They ARE basically the same deal,  just a different means of finding
the boxes. We don't dig or disturb the earth in any way.  If anything,
I have noticed there are less children that seem to do geocaching, but,
that is just my observation. Why do you have such a bad feeling about something
that is so similar? Is it because an electronic gadget (GPS) is used? 
Don't the clues from both hobbies come from the ultimate electronic gadget
- the Internet?   No one should be elitist about their particular
hobby - what ever happened to live and let live?</b><b></b>

I was very upset with the letterboxer Lucy and her remarks about Geocachers.<br/>
I was going to do both, loving the outdoors and all living things.<br/>
I hope that letterboxers have more regard for a fun and rewarding experience <br/>
of being out and enjoying nature, instead of bad mouthing Geocachers.<br/>
We should all try to get along in this world.<br/>
