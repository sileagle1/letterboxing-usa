                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the update on Tom's Trail. I am beginning to find out that those gladware boxes don't hold up well in the ice and snow. They seem to be cracking when they are opened in a frozen state. Thanks for the repairs that you did and for letting me know. It will probably be middle of March before I can get back down there. This is always a good argument for hiding two boxes in one park. One of them is bound to be still there and ok.<br/>
<br/>
I have never checked on the Sligo Creek Box nor have I heard that anyone has found it. I'll try to check it out as well. The log was only a couple feet long and it was about 10 -12 feet off the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for searching out my letterboxes and keeping me informed. I do hope you had a good time finding the others. <br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Squirrel<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Squirrel! Thanks so much for planting so many boxes in Maryland!!I lived <br/>
there as a child and found so much pleasure at returning to Wheaton Regional <br/>
Park and locating "The Railroad",and it's very special stamp!!It's so <br/>
wonderful to see that the train still runs!!Riding around the park in that <br/>
train was once my favorite thing to do and to recall the magic of those <br/>
times so long ago was a real treasure...funny..the park seemed so much <br/>
larger when I was 7yrs.old...at alomost 45yrs it seems to have shrunk! A <br/>
question of "boxing manners...I only carried the basics this trip down so <br/>
could not "help" your "Tom's Trail" box the way I would have liked..is it ok <br/>
for me to carry an extra container in the future in my regular 'boxing <br/>
backpack and replace a damaged box if I find it in bad shape? Best Regards, <br/>

I can't imagine anyone getting upset about their box being repaired.  <br/>
I think we have to count on each other a little for box maintenance, <br/>
particularly since some may be planted in areas we may never be able <br/>
to return to...<br/>
<br/>
I always try to carry paper towels and ziplock baggies with me.  <br/>
Don't always have room for an extra container, but I certainly <br/>
wouldn't object,actually I'd be honored to have a finder of my boxes <br/>
repair/maintain them if needed :-)<br/>
