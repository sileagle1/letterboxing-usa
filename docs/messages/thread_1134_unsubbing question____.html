I've been on this list for nearly a year now.  I haven't written in and <br/>
haven't followed what's going on for awhile.  I need to unsub from the list <br/>
at this time and I'm having a glitch. Apparently at some point the list was <br/>
moved to egroups.com.  I wasn't aware of this.  So, I went to egroups and I <br/>
was subbed to egroups but I have no idea what my password was signed in as.  <br/>
I know I can go to egroups and change the password and then unsub but, if I <br/>
can I'd like to avoid going through this.  Did someone move the list to <br/>
egroups and sub everyone using a  certain password without my knowing?  I'd <br/>
appreciate any help with this as I know it's a pain to have people asking <br/>
about unsubbing questions!  I know how to go and unsub...I just need to know <br/>
about the password question.  Thanks alot!  Happy Hunting!<br/>

You could resubscribe to the list and request receiving a digest of <br/>
e-mails. That would cut down on box-stuffing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the tip-off on the article. We had heard one was in the <br/>
works. Here's the address of the article:<br/>

&gt; Tom, Thanks for unsubbing me. Just as I get unsubbed there is a huge article <br/>
&gt; in the Sun.Sept. 3 issue of the Hartford Courant! (Hartford CT. U.S.A.) I <br/>
&gt; thought you and the group might enjoy checking it out!<br/>
&gt; Is there a way to stay updated without recieving all the Email? Thanks  <br/>
&gt; Enjoy, Randy<br/>
