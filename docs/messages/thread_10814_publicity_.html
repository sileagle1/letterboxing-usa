first instinct on discovering this hidden hobby was to write about it for the <br/>
local paper/public radio station--but then I decided that the <br/>
already-established community of LBers likely preferred secrecy...so I <br/>
haven't.<br/>
<br/>
A. Rose's recent e-mail (which includes mention of a newspaper article) has <br/>
me wondering--what IS the consensus on publicizing letterboxing in this way???<br/>

<br/>
I don't think there is a consensus.  It seems most of us learned <br/>
about letterboxing from some sort of newspaper or magazine (I <br/>
discovered it from Backpacking magazine myself), so it's not a bad <br/>
thing per se.  I guess a lot depends on the article and how it is <br/>
written (flattery towards letterboxers certainly helps!).<br/>
<br/>
The downside, of course, is that the more people who begin to <br/>
letterbox, the more "trouble" letterboxing becomes.  More people <br/>
hunting down boxes might cause more damage in fragil areas.  Some <br/>
newbies might try "digging" where they shouldn't for boxes.  If this <br/>
starts happening too often, letterboxing will start developing a bad <br/>
reputation that ultimately hurts everyone who wants to participate in <br/>
the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, news articles will be written about the hobby with or <br/>
without our consensus.  With our input, though, we can help "shape" <br/>
the story into a form that's pleasing to us.  =)<br/>
<br/>
So my two cents: Publicity isn't a bad thing per se, but we have to <br/>
be careful about making sure new people don't inadvertantly do things <br/>
to give letterboxers a bad name!<br/>
