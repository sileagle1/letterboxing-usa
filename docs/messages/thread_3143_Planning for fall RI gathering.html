                    <html><body><p>I know that it is still several weeks away but I am a compulsive planner.  Now is the chance for all of those who have made offers of help in the past to come forward with more specific plans.  I am looking for help in the following specific areas: games/activities - both general and child-oriented, conduct a stamp carving contest, organize event boxes, coordinate names for those camping, site prep/cleanup, etc.  I already have offers from Shannon (RIBNAG) to coordinate the food and Bill and Val Cox to provide an event banner, etc.</p>
<p>I had hoped to add an interactive area to the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/trishkri/Gather.html">Gathering </a>website for people to input ideas but I have to admit that I am severly Java-impaired and didn't want to take the time to learn.  If there is anything you would like to see there let me know.</p>
<p>I would like to get an early count of those who plan on attending so that we can get an idea of how many to expect.  When you have the time either respond to me here or offline (trishkri <u>at</u> yahoo.com).  If you have no objections I will list the proposed attendees on the webpage.</p>
<p>Finally, food...  There have been suggestions as to pizza, chili or potluck.  Any more ideas?  I like the chili idea and would bring a double batch of my favorite veggie chili.  We could have a few people bring regular chili con carne and combine it into one big pot, in addition.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your suggestions and help.</p>

Pizza AND chili sounds good to us!  We could bring a couple pizza.<br/>
<br/>
An easy, nearby event box or two for the children would be good.  The <br/>
kids got a big thrill while going after the Sunset Trails box that <br/>
Carolyn Stearns had at her Tuesday night get together recently at <br/>
Mansfield Hollow in CT.<br/>

<br/>
This site has some cool games for younger people. I've played The <br/>
Compass Game with my Scout troop and it was a huge hit. The only <br/>
thing I changed is that instead of rotating one space, we ran for any <br/>
seat we could get.<br/>
