the map AND here's another for the Appalachian Trail!<br/>
<br/>
Lion's Head Letterbox<br/>
Here is a place to go to get away from it all. However, note that it is a<br/>
popular spot to hike since it is rather short and offers views just about<br/>
360 degrees. It is especially nice during peak leaf-peeping season which of<br/>
course, is when I went.<br/>
<br/>
Finding out how to get there will require some research on your part. It is<br/>
simple though. Find a spot called Lion's Head on the Appalachian Trail in<br/>
Northwestern CT. It is not difficult to find. <br/>
When you find the road that leads to the trailhead to Lion's Head, park<br/>
just downhill before the house at the top of the hill. Bring your lunch,<br/>
your dog, and your camera past the house and down the dirt road. Look for<br/>
the AT blazes. Follow them up for what seems to be about a half mile and<br/>
you'll come to a clearing where a blue blazed trail continues just ahead<br/>
and a white blaze runs to the right. Take the trail that is right. Climb.<br/>
At the top of the hill (yay you made it) you will find a signed tree at<br/>
1738 feet.<br/>
