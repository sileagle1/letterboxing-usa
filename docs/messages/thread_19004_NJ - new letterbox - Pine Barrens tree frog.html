                    <div class="plaintext-content">Your journey starts at the place where this fire tower and 988 tree<br/>
were destroyed by the F-105 Thunderchief (the first jet designed to<br/>
release nuclear warheads at supersonic speeds).<br/>
<br/>
 Park in the parking lot of this old fire tower.  Take the trail at<br/>
240 degrees and walk up to where the fire tower used to be.  You can<br/>
still see the concrete foundations.  Stop and look west and look<br/>
through the trees, and you can see for miles of a clear day.  <br/>
<br/>
Take the trail west and head down hill.  This is a moderately steep<br/>
hill.  You will come to a place where the path will divide.  Stay on<br/>
the path at 300 degrees.  At the second down log on the path look for<br/>
the pine tree at 75 degrees and behind this pine tree, at its base,<br/>
you will find what you came for. Thank you for stamping in. Please<br/>
return it to it's proper resting spot and please cover well. Thank you. <br/>
<br/>
Always proceed at your discretion. The owner of this letterbox assumes<br/>
no responsibility for your actions or any occurrence to you or your<br/>
company on this hunt. Please remember you are in a state forest.<br/>
Remember pack in pack out your trash and only you can prevent forest<br/>
fires. Treat this forest as if it were your home. Tread lightly. <br/>

for those conditions, and to conduct oneself safely and responsibly<br/>
with respect to those conditions and with respect to his or her<br/>
personal abilities and limitations. "Letterboxing North America" and<br/>
the individual letterbox sponsors assume no liability for events which<br/>
may occur related directly or indirectly to one's searching for a<br/>
letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
Do not let children hunt for letterboxes unsupervised. <br/>
