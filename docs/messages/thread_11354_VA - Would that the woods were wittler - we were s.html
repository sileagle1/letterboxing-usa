<div>Team BeMa was bright and eager as we headed out to find the Tribute to the Woods.  Although we had already played tennis (da), worked out (da and na) and had swim lessons (Be and Ma) we were refueled on Wendy's nuggets and raring to go!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>First box proved a little puzzling.  We just didn't want to cross that first bridge (the bridge really not to cross is further down the path) So, we bushwhacked on one side of the creek and then the other and then the first side again...  How can you cross the creek yet keep it on the right?...  And what about those those scaly fungi?  Do we really want to touch them?!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>O.K. so 15 minutes later, after Ma had located and become stuck upon every bramble bush within 50 yards (even the teeny ones pressed down to pulp by all the snow and just starting to reemerge from the forest floor...) we finally realized we must have the wrong creek...  So, further down the trail we go until we saw the sign and followed the right path.  Found  a creek that was much easier to walk along side of.  There was a dad and two sons walking along the creek too (it was easier to walk along but it's not like there is a real path)  ooooooh -- an exchange?!  Who could that be?  Where is their piece of paper?  Where is there backpack?  Bummer, they were just hanging around throwing rocks in the creek.  They must have wondered why we followed them along the creek when there was lots of other space all around...  So that's the notched log!  Cool little waterfall!  So that's how you can cross a creek and keep going on the right!  So many fallen trees!  So much scaly fungi (the pokey stick came in real handy here!)  Be scoped out one root ball, Ma another, Na tackled a really big one and Da yet another!  As the old saying goes "so many root balls and scaly fungi, so little time!"  Da finally crooned with triumph!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Off to number 2!  Much easier this time.  Be really liked the bumpy tree!  He thought it would make great practice for rock climbing!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On the way to box #3 and the team starts to drag (except for Na who is in tip-top shape if I do say so myself! Or it could be that I finished my salad and the kids fries so I had lots of energy....)  We pass the playground and 3/4 of the team drops off.  They go sit on the swings while Na forges ahead!   Go mommy!  Go mommy!  Box #3 had a very snuggly hiding place and not a scaly fungi to be seen!  Coming back to the playground, Na tried to give the team a hint as to what the box was.  Although she did a mighty good impression (singing the ditty and everything) it took Da a long time to guess.  Be and Ma didn't have a clue.  I think we dated ourselves (again!)  Very cute stamp!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>One more box to go!  And it's on the way back to the car!  And we've promised the kids Baskin Robbins if they make it (with minimal whining!)  Up, up, up the path goes...Around and around.  Be and Ma are now supporting each other as they trudge up the path.  They stop and droop.  They call to each other for encouragement and pull and push each other up the hill (it was actually quite cute and touching to see).  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We made it!!  All four Tribute to the Woods boxes!  We really liked the theme!  It was not what we expected!  It was a lot of fun to find each stamp and see how it fitted in with the theme.  We liked that they were in different styles too!  Ma kept thinking that the separate words were a HH.  None to be found at that time (hint, hint) on this series...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Running back down the hill.  Backpack filled with the latest bark collection (we had to do some pretty fancy talking to get Ma to leave that great long piece of bark behind!)  Off to BR to replenish the calories burned on our hike!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks Daughter of the Old Dominion!  We had a great, exercise filled afternoon!  BeMa</div>
