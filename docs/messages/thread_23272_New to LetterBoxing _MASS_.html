                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi All!<br/>
Just discovered Letterboxing online while looking for hikes to do with <br/>
the kids, and WOW, This is really cool!  We are starting our first <br/>
search today.  I was so excited about it, that I spent Saturday night <br/>
making journals for the kids.  Scott and I have 8 children between the <br/>
two of us, and are always looking for inexpensive, but fun things to <br/>
do with the younger ones. The 4 youngest will be participating in this <br/>
new adventure.  They are 11, 10, 7, and 6 (all girls).  We do a lot of <br/>
hiking, bottle digging and making up our own adventures, but it is <br/>
going to be so much fun to "connect" with others on our outings.  We <br/>
live in Western Massachusetts, so today's adventure will begin close <br/>
to home.  Looking forward to sharing our "finds" with all of you! :)<br/>
Enthusiastically,<br/>
