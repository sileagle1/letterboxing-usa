As of 07:30 am (PST) the World of Letterboxing Website was hacked into and completed destroyed.  A Dr. Everett Van Scott (This is<br/>
not an accusation at all!) type of message was put in place of the front page and everything under it was destroyed.  I do have<br/>
backups of the software, however, the point used to break into the system has uncovered a fatal flaw in the software used.<br/>
<br/>
So, based on that, I am sorry to say that the original site is no longer available.  I have shifted gears and moved to a piece of<br/>
software that is more robust and security conscious.  This does, however, require everyone that was once a member, to login again.<br/>
The database of Clues has been saved though, that was a separate piece of software, not part of the main site and it was written by<br/>
myself, so we are ok there.  I'll have that back online as soon as the construction of the main site is back online.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing......  Being in the Computer Security Business means one thing..... Monitoring.  And the attack and break-in this<br/>
morning was monitored and logged.  I already know who did it and where they came from and how they got in.  Part of this business is<br/>
trying to secure holes before they are exploited but you know how it goes...  "Programming today is a race between software<br/>
engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So<br/>
far, the Universe is winning." And that sums it up.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry that I was unable to secure the site enough to deny someone the pleasure of destroying what I have attempted to build,<br/>
but, like the Phoenix, this Community shall rebuild itself from it's own ashes and rise again.<br/>
<br/>
Please stand by while I rebuild the site (There goes my weekend) and I shall let everyone know when it has returned.<br/>

I am really sorry this has happened to you.  I had<br/>
some time earlier this afternoon and was following<br/>
some links from Silver Eagle's website.  I saw yours<br/>
there and realized I had never really gotten to take a<br/>
good look at your website, so I followed the link and<br/>
found that it wasn't available.  I had no idea I was<br/>
visiting the scene of cyber vandalism!  There is no<br/>
logic to destruction like what you've experienced -<br/>
what a shame!<br/>
