We live near route 309 in Quakertown and also not too far from the Quakertown exit of Rt. 476. Depending on the schedule, we might be able to exchange.  I haven't looked at a map to see what your route would be.  On Sat. it would probably need to be after 4 PM, and on Thurs. I'm not sure of our schedule yet.  The only LB I can think of near Rt. 309 or 476 exits is Giant Peach, right near the Perkasie exit off 309.  The clues list the nearest town as Sellersville, and that is correct, but it's still Perkasie exit.  That one (Giant Peach) should only take you maybe 1/2 hour to find, from the exit.  I don't know its status; was there in April.  We might be able to meet you there on Thurs... one of my kids didn't get to stamp into that one yet anyway.  That park would provide a good lunch spot.  Can be pretty muddy near the LB though. I guess the Lehigh boxes in Allentown would be possibilities for you too, but you'd need a little more time for them, maybe an hour or more.  I think Lightnin' Bug said one is missing or vandalized?  I forget.  I've only searched for &amp; found one of them-- the fish one. We may also be willing to look for them with you-- my kids weren't along that time either &amp; could find them as well (they're older &amp; won't slow anyone down; in fact they're usually out in front.)  Feel free to email me at annalisa@fast.net , but just so you know I will be away from Wed. AM to Sat. 3 PM this week and won't respond to emails during that time.  --lunaryakketyact<br/>

looking under Lehigh County, which straddles I-476.  There is an exit <br/>
for Quakertown, about 15 miles south of Allentown and for Allentown.<br/>
<br/>
I can give you approximate driving distances from the Lehigh Valley <br/>
Interchange:<br/>
<br/>
Trexler Park - 2 miles<br/>
Rodale Fitness Park - 7 miles<br/>
Pass Set Spike - 3 miles<br/>
Allentown Rose Garden - 3 miles<br/>
Pool Wildlife Sanctuary - 5 miles<br/>
419 Scam - Mystery!!<br/>
Fish in Outer Space - 5 miles (not mine, though)<br/>
<br/>
2 Lehigh County boxes are missing - Lock Ridge and Just Flying <br/>
Through.<br/>
<br/>
Further up the Pike, you can take the Pocono Exit (I-80) to find the <br/>
two in Hickory Run park, though those WILL be a challenge compared to <br/>
my easy bags in Allentown.<br/>
