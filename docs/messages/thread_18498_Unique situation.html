I would think if they are all stamping into the host box, they would <br/>
also all be able to claim to be part of the find of the HH. Who gets <br/>
to choose the next destination is another story....<br/>

<br/>
If everyone in a group can stamp into a letterbox when the group finds it, would not everyone 'find' the Hitchhiker as <br/>
well?  If so, the group can therefore stamp into the Hitchhiker and then anyone, even the group could pass it on to <br/>
it's next destination, could they not?<br/>

<br/>
Everyone  stamps into the HH and counts it as a find if they are so<br/>
inclined.  The person who physically found it gets to move it along.<br/>
<br/>
As far as stamping yurself, well, hat is up to you--after all, it was your<br/>
HH, lol.  It might be neat to have had a record of that...I would probably<br/>
ahve stamped in or made a note in the log book.  Not counted it tho.<br/>

<br/>
You know I have run into similar situations once or twice.  Not too <br/>
long ago Iron`Bear, SimKitty, CampFireLady, CatsMeow and I were all <br/>
out letterboxing when we stumbled across a hitch hiker.  It was the <br/>
fist hitch hiker I had ever come across in a letterbox.  We all <br/>
stamped in and will forever have an ongoing joke about who the hitch <br/>
hiker belonged too. Insist they stole it from me because I had the <br/>
clues to the box and pointed to the hole it was hidden in.  They <br/>
insist they deserved it because they pulled it out and opened the <br/>
letterbox.  (laughing) either way we all got the stamp, so it <br/>
doesn't make much of a difference, except I get to pick on <br/>
CampFireLady all the time because of it! Hhehehe See CampFireLady! I <br/>
have not forgotten that you stole my hitch hiker yet!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think the answer should depend on the size of the HH.  The few <br/>
that I've seen and made are pretty small and the little logbooks can <br/>
get crowded pretty quick. Especially if you have a large group. If <br/>
this is the case, then the person who did the most work to find, or <br/>
made the actuall find, should be the only one to stamp in and place <br/>
elsewhere.  <br/>
<br/>
Alternately, you could also make a group stamp ahead of time.  The <br/>
group stamp would be stamped in the LB and everyone could put their <br/>
personal stamps after. If a HH is found, then only the group stamp <br/>
would be used.  I would also let the person who is going to place it <br/>
stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone counts an "F", only one gets the "P".  I think this would <br/>
add a little competition to the group and bring up any slackers.  <br/>
