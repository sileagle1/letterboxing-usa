The response has been wonderful, and those of us with really slow browsers, <br/>
and lots of stupid ads loading with every opened message, appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
In case you're new on the list - this is to avoid making everyone have to <br/>
open every message to find out, for instance, that your new box is in a <br/>
state we're not going to get to visit anytime soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again; at the rate people are complying, I think newbies will all <br/>
catch on just by reading all the subject lines and these monthly reminders <br/>
will become a thing of the past very, very soon!<br/>

Posting about list etiquette can perhaps be as annoying to some as<br/>
violating it is to others.  I have updated the list etiquette page<br/>
to reflect this request (http://www.letterboxing.org/list.html).<br/>
A link to this page appears in the trailer of every message.<br/>
<br/>
People who are interested in etiquette will read and follow it,<br/>
whilst experience shows that no matter how many times you make an<br/>
etiquette request, or how well-known particular etiquette is, some <br/>
people will continue to ignore it (the classic example is posting<br/>
"unsubscribe" requests to the list.  There are many others).<br/>
<br/>
I have a very slow link myself and have personal pet peeves about<br/>
certain common etiquette that is not followed (e.g. overquoting and<br/>
posting to the whole list technical problems like broken links that<br/>
should only go to the webmaster of the link in question).  I guess<br/>
all I'm getting, FWIW, at is that it could get lame if everyone who <br/>
had a pet etiquette request kept posting it to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Just my $.02.<br/>

<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It has been one month exactly since the last time I implored everyone to<br/>
&gt; &gt; please put their state or province in the subject line (and first on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; line).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Posting about list etiquette can perhaps be as annoying to some as<br/>
&gt; violating it is to others.<br/>
<br/>
The same as your immeadiate complaint when this issue comes up can be, ehh?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have updated the list etiquette page<br/>
&gt; to reflect this request (http://www.letterboxing.org/list.html).<br/>
&gt; A link to this page appears in the trailer of every message.<br/>
<br/>
I inore the links along with the advertisments. Part of the reason thsi<br/>
issue is an issue.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; People who are interested in etiquette will read and follow it,<br/>
&gt; whilst experience shows that no matter how many times you make an<br/>
&gt; etiquette request, or how well-known particular etiquette is, some<br/>
&gt; people will continue to ignore it (the classic example is posting<br/>
&gt; "unsubscribe" requests to the list.  There are many others).<br/>
<br/>
I don't agree. Case in point, since the last request was made a month ago<br/>
there's been a marked decrease in subject lines without state or province.<br/>
It is also very easy to ignore a message with the Subject: Unsubscribe. If<br/>
it is such a pet peeve of your Randy, put it in a kill file for unsubscribe.<br/>
Easy. All gone!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have a very slow link myself and have personal pet peeves about<br/>
&gt; certain common etiquette that is not followed (e.g. overquoting and<br/>
&gt; posting to the whole list technical problems like broken links that<br/>
&gt; should only go to the webmaster of the link in question).<br/>
<br/>
Overquoting is debateable because of some peoples feeling regarding<br/>
snipping. I haven't noticed the stuff that should go to the webmaster, but<br/>
maybe it because I read the Subject line and ignore those that talk of<br/>
broken links and such. Shows the importance of correctly using the Subject<br/>
line.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I guess<br/>
&gt; all I'm getting, FWIW, at is that it could get lame if everyone who<br/>
&gt; had a pet etiquette request kept posting it to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Not if they identify the issue in the subject line. Makes it all very simple<br/>
and just another example of why we should try and keep the Subject line in<br/>
line.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO of course.<br/>
