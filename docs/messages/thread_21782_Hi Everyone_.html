My name is Ramona and I am new to this group!  I have never heard of <br/>
Letterboxing until about 5 minutes ago while searching Yahoo looking <br/>
for some local groups (I'm in Southern CA, SFV) that do "Amazing Race" <br/>
type hunts and I came across a Michigan group that referred to this - <br/>
started clicking on some links and doing a little reading - and ended <br/>
up here!  I'm really intrigued and interested in learning more about <br/>
this - I'm not quite sure I get the front-end portion of it all - but <br/>
it looks like you have some good info in your files to dig through, so <br/>
I'm looking forward to reading up on this, and if there is anyone who <br/>
would like to give me more info on this hobby, or anyone in the area <br/>
who could tell me more about local activities, I'd love to hear more <br/>
about them!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Ramona :-)<br/>

You need to join the newboxers list here on yahoo, and there's a southern california list.  These sites should answer most of your questions, find out where to get supplies, etc. Have fun. <br/>
