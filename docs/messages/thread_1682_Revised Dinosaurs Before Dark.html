Could you please substitute the following description for the one I sent in<br/>
initially for Dinosaurs Before Dark.  Melissa was nice enough to point out<br/>
that I had a near fatal flaw in one of the directions.  Fortunately she and<br/>
Dan were savvy enough letterboxers to find it with my flawed info.  I don't<br/>
want to keep anyone from finding our box at Westwoods.  This is my favorite<br/>
time to hike there with all the great icicle formations on the yellow dot<br/>
trail so I hope that others take advantage of the corrected info.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Trish (in just a few more inches of snow but no ice, please, RI)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Trish! You may have noticed in your travels that we carry on <br/>
a classic Dartmoor tradition here: loving it when we're "first" to <br/>
visit a letterbox. Well, I was SURE I would be first to Dinosaur, and <br/>
I WAS a couple of days ahead of M&amp;D (who must have the most "firsts" <br/>
in the nation), but I wasn't savvy enough to turn this way instead of <br/>
that! I spent an hour looking for that particular rock, hoping to <br/>
find Dinosaur and the traveling box inside. I felt kind of silly <br/>
cruising back and forth and looking along every likely suspect and <br/>
not finding it, but I did have a lovely day in Westwoods! I should <br/>
have had the kids along, since they're more flexible and not as prone <br/>
to preconception. They often find a box while I'm still staring at <br/>
the cluesheet with a puzzled expression. Now I'll go try again!<br/>

Wow, now I feel really bad.  I should have been more careful with my <br/>
first letterbox!  Back 10+ years ago when I lived in East Lyme and my <br/>
husband and I were dating we used to hike and mountain bike in <br/>
Westwoods monthly.  Now that we have small kids and live an hour <br/>
farther away we only get there once or twice a year.  I have to <br/>
confess that we didn't do your Monument letterbox as we had other <br/>
trails planned for that day but in my hubris I was sure that I <br/>
remembered correctly where the rock you described was in relation to <br/>
Dinosaur rock (as we have always called it).  We planted it by hiking <br/>
back from the end which is how Melissa and Dan finally found it.  I <br/>
promise to be more careful from now on.  I know that the last 4 <br/>
planted in RI had accurate directions (as Bob and Melissa can attest <br/>
to).<br/>
<br/>
There are 17 more books in the series so I guess that I had better <br/>
get busy carving to give you another (more accurate) chance.<br/>

little whiney, but as Randy has said in the past, sometimes it's the <br/>
boxes you don't find that are the most fun. I had a really great day <br/>
at Westwoods looking for Dinosaur! Can't wait to get back and look <br/>
again. And a 17-letterbox series based on such a classic is absolutely <br/>
wonderful!<br/>
