exchange?<br/>
&gt; ...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The steps for obtaining a Personal Traveler are outlined in section<br/>
3.14 of the Official Letterboxer's Code, quoted here for convenience.<br/>
<br/>
-Isosceles<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. Upon identification of a Personal Traveler Carrying Letterboxer<br/>
(PTCL) one must first attract the PTCL's attention, which can be done<br/>
in a number of ways. Frantic handwaving, loud bodily noises, physical<br/>
violence, or fire alarms are not recommended until such time as other,<br/>
More Reasonable Measures(MRM's) have been unsuccessfully attempted.<br/>
MRM's include simply saying hello, offering a gift, or in some cases<br/>
cash. Do not attempt any of the MRM's from farther than 10 meters from<br/>
the PTCL, as this is likely to draw attention to the transaction.<br/>
<br/>
2. Once the PTCL's attention has been obtained, the transaction moves<br/>
into the Clandestine Incantation Stage(CIS). The details of the<br/>
incantation vary from PT to PT, but generally involve a brief phrase,<br/>
song, or dance routine to be performed discreetly by the Personal<br/>
Traveler Requestor (PTR). When performing said incantation at an<br/>
officially sanctioned letterboxing gathering, the participants may<br/>
wish to use one of the Personal Traveler Exchange Booths (PTEB) that<br/>
are typically available at said events.<br/>
<br/>
3. With the PTCL's attention obtained, and the CIS completed the PTR<br/>
is now in a position to request the Personally Imprinted Traveler<br/>
Stamp (PITS). Both the inking and the stamping are to be performed by<br/>
the PT's owner, though the PTR is free to hold the logbook if no table<br/>
is readily available. Should a bad print ensue, the PTR may request<br/>
replacement PITS, but the PTO is not required to supply a second copy.<br/>
<br/>
4. At this point the exchange is officially complete, with the<br/>
exception of PT's from Pennsylvania and Delaware, where the<br/>
Letterboxer's Secret Handshake (LSH) is required to seal the deal.<br/>
<br/>

prize, I think it is best to do so with some subtlety. If it requires you to<br/>
figure out the answer to some question, then sometimes it is fun to guess<br/>
with others.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if your PT clue changes with each gathering, like mine, it could<br/>
get confusing...but I try to make some aspect of my appearance conspicuous<br/>
so that people are led to ask a particular question....<br/>

Of course, one always runs the risk of   being under SPTS (Suspicion of<br/>

some are willing to take.<br/>

Unless there is a decree that hereby declares all PTCL's to meet at<br/>

Here Here! Whereby all PTCLs that carry said PT now utilize their own<br/>
MO  and other MRMs to initiate the CIS from a PTR in order to gain<br/>
impression of said PT in the PTRs logbook.<br/>

Do we need to make an ammendment to section 3.14 of the OLC (Official<br/>
