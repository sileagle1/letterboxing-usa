evening, I was alerted that my computer had contracted the Happy99 <br/>
virus.<br/>
<br/>
This virus arrives as an e-mail attachment. If you open it, you get a <br/>
little video fireworks display. I remember that happening to me about <br/>
three weeks ago, though I don't recall whose e-mail it was. I <br/>
apparently deleted the message, as it no longer seems to be in my <br/>
folders. But the virus had done its work.<br/>
