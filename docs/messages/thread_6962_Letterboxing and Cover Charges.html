                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>While driving all over Western Mass. the last few days, we passed a bunch of places that would be great to put boxes in. Some of the sites, however, have parking fees or whatnot to get in. In fact, one of the places we just put a box in does have a small charge on weekends, which is probably when most folks would go up there looking for it. So I want to put a question to the list.
<br/>
<br/>If you see clues for a box that is in a park or reservation that has a parking or use fee, would that stop you from going to look for it? If so, why? If not, why not?

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It doesn't stop us. We're prepared to pay a parking fee at just about <br/>
any park with a lot. If a clue says "park roadside" then we presume it <br/>
to be free.<br/>
<br/>
CT state parks charge a $5 parking fee ($8 for out-a-staters). With <br/>
some parks, whether they charge depends on their staffing. Sometimes <br/>
you slip in for free, just because they have no one to sit and take <br/>
your $$. With most you can park elsewhere and walk a little to save <br/>
the cash.<br/>
<br/>
There has been one exception: The Regional Water Authority (New Haven <br/>
area, CT). They only have one option: buy a seasonal use permit, which <br/>
is something like $35 per person. With that you get a couple (one time <br/>
use) guest permits. They control some nice properties, but one would <br/>
have to get a LOT of use out of it to make it worthwhile, IMO.<br/>

letterbox is someplace that requires a fee, I will pay it.  It can be an<br/>
inconvenience, at times, so I try to get annual passes if I can, since I<br/>
tend to go back to really beautfiul natural places often when I get the<br/>
chance.  I know my Oregon State Park Annual Pass has more than paid for<br/>
itself since we got it in late December.  The NW Forest Pass, too!  Not<br/>
to mention our local Metro Pass that gets us into Oxbow Park and Blue<br/>
Lake, were there are letterboxes in the Portland, OR area, as well as<br/>
local boat ramps where we put in with our kayaks and canoe.  I can stand<br/>
to fork out the dough if it means our great local park systems will be<br/>
maintained and accessible.<br/>

&gt; parking or use fee, ...... One of my favorite boxes to date was <br/>
St.Marie Among the Iroquois in N.Y. it was in a small muesam with a <br/>
fee and it was great! The interpreters would not step out of the time <br/>
period no matter how hard you tried. The 1600's fascility was very <br/>
interesting and our talk with them on farming delightful. Cowboy <br/>
tried to get them to come into the 21 st century to no avail. <br/>
    Stay tuned next week for a Mansfield historical Socioty box it <br/>
will have specified hours to visit the muesam and a small fee but <br/>
well worth it as the carving is one of my best and having itin the <br/>
muesam will protect it. Besides the muesam is a gem of local history <br/>
and Uconn history.  Leader of the Pack <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Considering that the reason for the "cover charge" is usually for <br/>
preservation of the park, I usually don't mind at all.  I think I would pay <br/>
up to $10 a car.  If I was given a choice to spend 3 hours letterboxing or 3 <br/>
hours watching a movie for the same price, letterboxing would win (weather <br/>
providing).<br/>
<br/>
I would let it stop me, however, if I didn't like the site.  One box in MA is <br/>
accessable through a paid parking lot at a beach, something like $5 and we <br/>
gladly bypassed that one.<br/>
<br/>
I've also seen park areas that are just too expensive.  I doubt there is a <br/>
letterbox there, but the unfinished Crazy Horse memorial in South Dakota was <br/>
$30 per car when I was there in '93.  We didn't even consider paying it.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Letterboxing and Cover Charges<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
Greetings,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; While driving all over Western Mass. the last few 
days, we passed a bunch of <br/>&gt; places that would be great to put boxes in. 
Some of the sites, however, have <br/>&gt; parking fees or whatnot to get in. In 
fact, one of the places we just put a <br/>&gt; box in does have a small charge 
on weekends, which is probably when most <br/>&gt; folks would go up there 
looking for it. So I want to put a question to the <br/>&gt; list.<br/>&gt; 
<br/>&gt; If you see clues for a box that is in a park or reservation that has a 
<br/>&gt; parking or use fee, would that stop you from going to look for it? If 
so, <br/>&gt; why? If not, why not?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Mike S.<br/>&gt; P4 F44

Generally speaking Amy and I don't mind a nominal fee to get into a <br/>
park or rec. area.  We just like to know about it ahead of time.  If <br/>
you could please post in the begining of your clues that there is a <br/>
fee and how much.  That would help.<br/>
Thank you<br/>
Patrick and Amy<br/>

If so, <br/>
&gt; why? If not, why not?<br/>
<br/>
I only mind paying the fees when I don't find the *&amp;^%$# box!<br/>
<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, warnings in the clues are nice, and I wouldn't do a bunch <br/>
of pay-to-play parks in one day if I could avoid it. But an entrance <br/>
fee of over $5 does put me off a bit. I wouldn't rule out completely <br/>
going to that park, it would just depend on the circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
Park fees are unavoidable, though, I suppose.<br/>
