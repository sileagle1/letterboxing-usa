Hi gang!!<br/>
<br/>
Okay so pandora is all settled in Oregon now and I look on the list and what<br/>
to I know... my good friend Rayvenhaus<br/>
seems to have joined the group.  I wanted to send a big welcome out to<br/>
im.  --- Soooo in the meantime thought I would bring something up to the<br/>
group.. You have all heard of "Googled" or 100*100D -- Okay well I am one of<br/>
the original members of Googled and I have heard from the Founder Sir<br/>
Balthazar that it is sort of like Hotel California -- Once you are in you<br/>
can never check out -- but in the mean time I am thinking it is time to<br/>
start another little letter boxing club of my own here in the Pacific<br/>
Northwest.  Sooo I have decided to put a note out there letting people know<br/>
that I am considering doing this and seeing who would be interested.  The<br/>
club would be based in Portland as that is the nearest large city to wear I<br/>
am, and anyone willing to travel to the Portland area for club meetings and<br/>
gatherings is welcome to contact me about joining.  My private e-mail<br/>
address is hispandora@phlsystems.com I look forward to hearing from any of<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Until then, keep boxing!<br/>

Good morning there pandora!  It is nice to finally hear from you here on the LBNA group....  Thanks for the welcome. And thanks for getting nadira all fired up about trying this sport.... We're loving every minute of it now!  I've even got 20 boxes ready to place in a few sites here in the Tacoma area, just awaiting finishing of the stamps.<br/>
<br/>
We're going to do a series here at Bresemann Forest, and are setting up to takeover SunSeeker's box in Spanaway Park and add more of our own.  I've also been researching parks around here and have come up with ideas for a ton more!!!!  Now all I need to do is perfect my carving abilities.  (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Rayvenhaus<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Are you a member of the LBPNW group?  If not, why don't you come over and join us?<br/>
<br/>
P.S.S.  What does Googled and 100**100D mean?<br/>

<br/>
Well it is good to hear that you are so busy letterboxing -- When I visited<br/>
last year there were I think 3 letter boxes in Tacoma total.  I can just<br/>
tell that is all going to change soon!  As for carving abilities I could<br/>
give you some pointers -- also you might talk to Sir Balthazar, he runs<br/>
Googled and they have the best damn carever in that group = JugglerMouse.  I<br/>
am a memeber of Googled too -- and I do believe Sir Balthazar said something<br/>
to me as I left about having become the second best carver in the group.<br/>
Yeahaw, Heavans knows it would take an act of G-d for me to ever match<br/>
JugglerMouse.<br/>
<br/>
Cool to hear you have so many ready to go. I have a about 15-20 that are<br/>
carved and ready to be placed as well, I am going to be doing a series in<br/>
the Portland area based on childrens songs.  Just as soon as I find the time<br/>
to start planting.  I would love to join the LBPNW but never heard anything<br/>
about it... can you provide a link?<br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear someone else is as addicted as I am -- <br/>
Well I am off -- <br/>
Hey Rayvenhaus you have hear about E's (Exchanges) right? Where you collect<br/>
other people's signature stamp?  You know Iron`Bear and I both have<br/>
personaly caved signature stamps!<br/>
