Location: Mohawk State Forest, Litchfield County, Connecticut<br/>
Time: It depends on how you want to negotiate it!  It's only about two miles.<br/>
         If you drive most of the way -- 10 minutes.  Hiking the whole way?  Maybe<br/>
         2 hours.<br/>
         You can leave the car at a number of places along the way and walk the rest.  <br/>
         It's up to you!<br/>

Directions:<br/>
Go to the entrance of the State Forest, which is on Rt.4, near the Cornwall/West <br/>
Goshen line.<br/>
There is a parking area right off the highway, before the gate.<br/>
There are options: you can hike, bike or drive -- almost the entire way to the box.<br/>
It's a narrow, paved road, except for the very end -- which is dirt driveway/woods.<br/>
Views along the way are spectacular year around.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Start at the gate at the entrance to the park,<br/>
Near the sign that says it closes at dark.<br/>
Keep low your speed, no matter the mode,<br/>
As you make your way down Toumey Road.<br/>
<br/>
At 1.2 miles (you can't get lost),<br/>
You'll come to where the A-T once crossed.<br/>
Pull in and stop, you won't be sorry<br/>
To view the Berkshires in all their glory.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on for two-tenths more;<br/>
"Halt!" the sign does strongly implore.<br/>
Go west! Ye seekers of the Quest!<br/>
(that's "right" for those more or less clueless...)<br/>
<br/>
Go south at Strattman's old homestead,<br/>
There's good hiking here at a multi-trailhead,<br/>
And a parking lot for those that pine<br/>
For an outhouse, sans half-moon sign!  <br/>
<br/>
It's not far now; slow down your rate;<br/>
Pull in left past the twin stone pillars and gate.<br/>
Cross the road, and go around the portal;<br/>
Approach the tower cautiously, ye mere mortal!<br/>
<br/>
Beware the glass from drunken vandals!  <br/>
Mustn't blow out your favorite sandals!<br/>
Study the tower, it's sure not flimsy -<br/>
The object of one gentleman's whimsy.<br/>
<br/>
To ask the smiling gargoyle he might say,<br/>
"The large white birch is on your way!"<br/>
Go there and veer right, it just makes sense<br/>
Since you'll want to encounter an old wire fence.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, things aren't always as they seem.<br/>
Keep following the fence to your "pipe" dream!<br/>
Keep and open mind, and don't despair!<br/>
This ain't your usual Tupperware!<br/>
<br/>
A word of caution -- listen to reason;<br/>
Watch your fingers during sneaky-snake season!<br/>
