                    <div class="plaintext-content">First off, the travelling event stamps do not belong to me, <br/>
JugglerMouse, Ash Raven, or Googled. We here were only temporarily in <br/>
charge of them. We are not adding our SLO Stamping in the Meadow <br/>
event stamp to this pile. We are only adding a new traveling box with <br/>
both the Yes and NO on cheese racing stamps in it. <br/>
<br/>
These boxes that we have did not come all together. We thought the <br/>
Pacific NW folk would want their own stamp back up there; checking in <br/>
on it, and all. We also saw that the Opraha one had most of the PNW <br/>
folk already stamped in on it (Rayvenhaus, Pandora, and Iron Bear.) <br/>
Thus, we figured we would send that to the East Coast. <br/>
<br/>
It is not our place to be loyal to Googled members because these <br/>
stamps are not ours. Simple as that.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, we put in the last post that the Jersey folk and the PNW folk <br/>
could discuss this off board and tell us their consensus. That was <br/>
our vain hope. Sigh. One more time, we are very fond of Steve <br/>
Rayvenhaus and his gracious handling of this correspondence. Look for <br/>
a small surprise with those we send to you. Nothing more on that <br/>
subject.<br/>
<br/>
About the firefighters' stamp: please, before we get more of our <br/>
undies in a knot, reread what I first wrote. I said that -- and read <br/>
this to the end, please -- one could be a blood donor, registered <br/>
organ donor, someone certified in CPR or the like. Got that? Heck, I <br/>
don't think Lance cares if you want to bring in a teddy bear for an <br/>
EMT to give to a hurt kid, some Carbolite for the firefighters, or <br/>
just buy a ticket to a raffle. It is just that these firefighter/EMTs <br/>
are heroes. They do not get paid much at all. Ours in Grover are <br/>
volunteers. They risk their lives to help us. This was just a way to <br/>
show support of these gals and guys. <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I am really glad that folk donate blood, register to give <br/>
up their organs instead of burying them, and occasionally help a kid <br/>
in need. If I need blood when I am on the operating table or a <br/>
kidney, maybe it will be from a letterboxer. I am registered to <br/>
donate bone marrow. Again, not for everyone. <br/>
<br/>
This box, when it is carved (by JugglerMouse) and placed, can be <br/>
accessed by ANYONE who shows support of almost any kind for the <br/>
Grover Beach Firefighters. Heck, they are suckers for kids. You think <br/>
they would deny a kid a stamp in their book?<br/>
<br/>
Please, turn off the flame war. You know when this is getting too <br/>
charred for the board. I know you do. If you think it is a good idea <br/>
to post something that might be roasting, write it out and sleep on <br/>
it. Email it personally to those involved. Anymore, I just am tired <br/>
of reading whiny and accusative posts here.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Sir Balthazar and JugglerMouse<br/>
