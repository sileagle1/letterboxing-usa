<br/>
Is there anyone out here on the East coast that would be interested <br/>
in getting togther this late summer/fall/winter for a group <br/>
meet/greet? I know a great little cabin near Skyline Drive in western <br/>
VA that is about 60 yards off the Appalacian Trail. We could rent the <br/>
cabin for fairly cheap maybe one weekend, get together and meet each <br/>
other. Maybe share our most secret carving secrets, tips for good <br/>
boxes, and maybe even go all out and plant some boxes.<br/>
<br/>
So, is there anyone up to it? If you are interested I can set up <br/>
everything if it is held in DC, VA, or MD. If another east coast <br/>
state than I would be more than willing to help someone plan the <br/>
event.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be a great time to actually meet all of the uniquely <br/>
named LetterBoxers that we chat with on a regular basis. Also, I am <br/>
itching to learn more tips and tricks.<br/>
<br/>
So, whatdaya say...<br/>
<br/>
Let me know....<br/>

We'll go with the flow....but perhaps a location more centrally located for DC, MD, DE, VA...like DCish or Richmond...but we *love* the mountains too.  Will go with what's best for all.  Let me know if we can help.<br/>

<br/>
there is a letterbox gathering on the east coast this fall.  It is <br/>
the "Mystery Gathering" and is listed on the "what's new" section of <br/>
the letterboxing web site.  The write up is very clever.  Since it is <br/>
a mystery to be solved (not very hard these days with the internet) <br/>
all I will say is that it is on the east coast, not in VA and is this <br/>
fall.  <br/>
<br/>
If you have not been to a gathering before they are a lot of fun.  <br/>
The last one I went to had over 60 people at it.  It is really neat <br/>
to met the people in person you have "talked to" on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you solve the mystery and can make it.<br/>

   We would love to join the group. Depending on the date, count us <br/>
in. We can't let New England and Pacific Northwest have all the fun! <br/>
I sure hope the infamous Jolly G Man will be able to attend. I have <br/>
yet to get to one of his boxes. I just think it would be fun to meet <br/>
everyone. We live near Frederick, MD so any place you suggest is good.<br/>

So lets try and nail down a date first...then we can work on the <br/>
location...and other details...<br/>
<br/>
How about the last weekend in September (Sat 28th or Sun 29th)?<br/>
<br/>
Is that good for everyone....?<br/>
<br/>
As far as locations go...three basic choices.<br/>
<br/>
a. City/urban<br/>
b. Mountains<br/>
c. Beach/coastal<br/>

Lets get the party started.<br/>

   NO, I am!  It's been 20 years the last time I was in the SNP. I <br/>
just remembered it to be a loooong drive back to Balto. Had to check <br/>
out a map to find out what I was thinking.  Thanks for questioning.  <br/>
West VA/ Western VA   augh!!!    Glad this isn't a test!<br/>

The Skyline Drive, aka the Shenandoah National Park (SNP), is in the <br/>
western part of Virginia.  I usually access the park via Route 33 <br/>
near Elkton, VA.  It takes about 2 hours from DC and 2 hours from <br/>
Richmond to get to that part of the park.  <br/>
<br/>
Newbe1 suggested a cabin but we could also get together at the Big <br/>
Meadows Lodge or one of the campgrounds...there are lots of options.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest an early morning affair on Sunday...fewer people than <br/>
in the afternoon plus it is much prettier!  I drive the drive to <br/>
Connecticut once a month or so...you are looking at 8 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Newbe1...what say you?<br/>

&gt; A suggestion:<br/>
<br/>
It may be easier to determine a time and meeting place and hope that <br/>
many will be able to attend.  With varying schedules and states of <br/>
residence, a consensus will be impossible.<br/>
<br/>
As much as we all want to put faces to names, we have to accept the <br/>
fact that not everyone will be able to make it.  That just gives us <br/>
an excuse to get together again come spring time. <br/>
<br/>
Whaddaya think?<br/>
<br/>
Also, did the RussClan nab our hitchhikers that quickly?  We were <br/>
thinking that maybe they were posted incorrectly but are now <br/>
wondering if some overly avid boxers just scooped them up in record <br/>
time! <br/>

Hello fellow LetterBoxers,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is there anyone out here on the East coast that would be interested <br/>
&gt; in getting togther this late summer/fall/winter for a group <br/>
&gt; meet/greet? I know a great little cabin near Skyline Drive in <br/>
western <br/>
&gt; VA that is about 60 yards off the Appalacian Trail. We could rent <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; cabin for fairly cheap maybe one weekend, get together and meet <br/>
each <br/>
&gt; other. Maybe share our most secret carving secrets, tips for good <br/>
&gt; boxes, and maybe even go all out and plant some boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, is there anyone up to it? If you are interested I can set up <br/>
&gt; everything if it is held in DC, VA, or MD. If another east coast <br/>
&gt; state than I would be more than willing to help someone plan the <br/>
&gt; event.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think it would be a great time to actually meet all of the <br/>
uniquely <br/>
&gt; named LetterBoxers that we chat with on a regular basis. Also, I am <br/>
&gt; itching to learn more tips and tricks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, whatdaya say...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let me know....<br/>

What are the names of your hitchers?  We 'box' with bunches of others here so I might be able to clue you in.<br/>
<br/>
We placed a hitchhiker recently and it too found a ride very quickly.  A testament to this lively group of letterboxers here in Virginia!<br/>

make a great site.  Jolly G-Man has suggested a recreation area in <br/>

That sounds reasonable. So how about the Quantico area, or maybe <br/>
MAson Neck State Park.  Or how about meeting around the National <br/>
Mall area....I am very open to new suggestions if the SNP is <br/>
anti-LetterBoxish. <br/>

As much as I love the SNP, I have to agree.  I had a box disappear on <br/>
me there, also.  I'd be happy to drive to Northern Virginia or <br/>
DC...can we still do it Sunday, September 29?<br/>

What do you mean my group claimed them???<br/>
I don't do website listings silly.<br/>
Looks like a simple error from an a overworked webmaster.<br/>
I think the confusion may have come from us (The Russ Clan) planting a box (called Green Tea) and posting it shortly before your hitcher called "Japanese Tea House"<br/>
I'm sure the correction will be noted with this e-mail and fixed when they are able.<br/>

Claimed your hitchers...geez!<br/>

The park at Quantico is great.  I'll contact Jolly G-Man to ask if he <br/>
knows how to go about reserving a shelter and throw it out for <br/>

The end of September is good for me! I will write it on my calendar.<br/>
