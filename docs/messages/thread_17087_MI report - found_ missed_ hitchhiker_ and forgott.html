so I thought we'd get in a little of this new activity I seem to <br/>
have become addicted to.<br/>
<br/>
Looked for Cherry Captial LB downtown Traverse City but were unable <br/>
to find it. LbnA link indicates this box was originally placed by <br/>
Esperanza but Spring Chick is currently maintaining the box. Have <br/>
emailed Spring Chick with the report of it possibly being missing. <br/>
(Couldn't be me, could it? LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
Drove out Old Mission and found the Archie Park box ... great clues! <br/>
Then out to the lighthouse where we went in search of box planted by <br/>
Matt the Rat.<br/>
<br/>
Found the box and much to the delight of this beginner ... the <br/>
Dragon Rider hitch-hiker was inside as well!<br/>
<br/>
Got half way back down Old Mission before I remembered I wanted to <br/>
search for the other letterbox out at the lighthouse! LOL ... too <br/>
excited over finding a hitch-hiker (or my brain was fogged from the <br/>
hypothermia ... lol) I guess! (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Then when I check my email, I found messages from two people who've <br/>
found the first letterbox I planted (Kent Trails) too! <br/>
<br/>
And .... I found time to carve two more stamps for the Nautical <br/>
Knots series I'm planning. (Anyone going to Beaver Island should <br/>
keep that in mind ... grin)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
