quality of your letterboxes, I say let it be the ziplock bags!! <br/>
Regardless of whether or not you include ink pads (I don't, but <br/>
Bravo! to those who do) I recommend using several bags for each box.<br/>
<br/>
Put the logbook in a sandwich bag. Put the stamp in another one. <br/>
Perhaps you'll want others for an ink pad... postcards/info sheet... <br/>
whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Then stuff them all in a freezer bag. (I like the Hefty OneZip brand <br/>
with the easy-close slider.) If you want to be REALLY safe, stuff the <br/>
whole mess into a second freezer bag.<br/>
<br/>
If you do all of this, the quality of the box is of little <br/>
importance. Even if the box leaks, everything will stay safe and dry. <br/>
The box just keeps it all a little more self-contained.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe we sould start including these, too?  Let's see... I've got a <br/>
logbook, rubber stamp, ink pad, writing instrument, info sheets, <br/>
postcards, doggie biscuits, baby wipes, maybe a little <br/>
mascot/figurine (just for fun), clues to the next box, and a <br/>
hitchhiker box. The dividing line between Letterboxing and Geocaching <br/>
is getting blurrier all the time :o)<br/>
<br/>
I think I'm going to have to start using bigger containers :o)<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of containers, someone mentioned the new (somewhat pricey) <br/>
rubbermaid boxes with see-thru tops and a blue rubber seal. If you <br/>
really want to assure that you've got everything cryogenically sealed <br/>
against the elements, these are awesome. I reserve them for hiding <br/>
places where I know the box is going to be subjected directly to <br/>
water. But I still double-bag... just in case.<br/>

I agree.  After this winter I am going to start using more than one <br/>
bag and make sure they are the freezer bags.  I am also planning on <br/>
carrying extras with me to change over those in the boxes I have <br/>
already planted.  As for the new Rubbermaid boxes, I think that they <br/>
are better but I have found water in some of those also...<br/>

I think the trick is for all hunters to be very careful to close the <br/>
box tightly.  You can test a container for watertightness at home by <br/>
filling it with water and see if it leaks.<br/>
<br/>
The only watertight ones which seem unsuitible then are the really <br/>
cheap Gladlock or Ziplock ones which easily crush under the rock <br/>
piles they're hiddden in, preventing good seal.<br/>
