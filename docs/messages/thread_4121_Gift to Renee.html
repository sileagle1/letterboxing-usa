                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Gift to Renee box has been removed from it's spot at Fisherville <br/>
Brook and retired, after being out for about one year. In that year, <br/>
she had many visitors and well wishers. Renee would like to thank you <br/>
all, starting with the Lange's from Virginia, who gave her the <br/>
letterbox as a Xmas gift. It was put out with a journal smaller than <br/>
most boxes contain, with the idea that after the journal had been <br/>
filled, the whole box would be retired, and kept as a remembrance to <br/>
Renee of all of you who took the time to seek her out, and a keepsake <br/>
of her first planted letterbox. She also wants you all to know that <br/>
her favorite stamp in her journal is of the marshmallow roasting <br/>
turtle, which only seems fitting, since we met Dan and Melissa on our <br/>
way out from planting the box, but didn't really know it until days <br/>
later when we read the postings here and put two and two together. <br/>
Anyway, thanks again to all, and we hope you all enjoy the <br/>
sport/hobby of letterboxing for years to come. Seeya on the trails.<br/>
