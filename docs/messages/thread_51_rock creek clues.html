of you in the North Central and New England states.)<br/>

Reason enough for me to go letterboxing.  I found both the Possum's Penthouse<br/>
and the newly relocated Rock Creek Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Loved the new location!!! It's even better than the first one!!  Maybe Thom<br/>
thinks it's too obvious for summer months, though, huh?  I liked the bonus<br/>
stamp that was added for the relocation... a little something extra for my<br/>
book!!<br/>
<br/>
I really liked the stamp at Possum's Penthouse.  I see Thom decided to try<br/>
something new... instead of white vinyl, Thom found a nice firm green rubber<br/>
eraser to carve this one out of.  The results are very nice. Although large<br/>
white vinyl erasers are perfect for those fantastic woodcut-looking<br/>
masterpieces that Susan Davis and others create, I have long been a fan of<br/>
green and red rubber erasers for making smaller stamps with fine-line details.<br/>
It's fun to experiment with different types of erasers.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, everyone,<br/>

Actually, although it is EXTREMELY close to the paved path, the location<br/>
will be harder to see in the summer because of the foliage.  I had to<br/>
hack back the blackberry vines to get at this one.  I have walked by<br/>
that particulkar spot for 4 years and not seen that little "nook."  I<br/>
might dream up new clues and make this the permanent home.<br/>

I went shopping at our new "Michael's" and they seem to have the widest<br/>
variety of erasers.  The green is good to carve because it is very<br/>
firm.  I was impressed that Coon's Cache was carved from a Pink Pearl<br/>
and that made me want to experiment.  I also bought a chunk of that<br/>
Speedball Speedy Cut.  Not as impressed.  It is very soft &amp; tends to<br/>
crumble the details.  Rock Creek #2 is carved from the Speedy Cut.  I<br/>
want to make a set of carving implements based on your pencil ferrule<br/>
method and try that out next.<br/>
