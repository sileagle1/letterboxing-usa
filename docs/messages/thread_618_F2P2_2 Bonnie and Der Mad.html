<div>I like your coding after your name Bonnie.  
I can't wait until some creative person comes out with the found "10" 
letterboxes stamps patch that we can where proudly sewed on our jacket.  
Anyone given that a thought?  I know you have to order that in bulk to get 
a reasonably 
price.            </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Any way our family just got back from Der Mad 
Stamper territory and found some stamps.  Not to leave out Kevin and Cara, 
my Ginny and daughter Andrea found Mt. St. Helen's first stamp.  
Unfortunately, my son Kyle and myself didn't that day as we were ascending the 
South side of Mt. St. Helens to the "Summit".  And along the way 
up that monster .....drum roll please.......he and I planted the 2nd and 3rd Mt. 
St. Helens letterbox stamps.   So my score for that trip was F2P2 and 
overall F2P7.  The clues for those two stamps will follow in another 
email.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So I found two but couldn't find three 
letterboxes by the Der Mad Stamper.  Mitch did I dream it or was the Mt. 
Tabor stamp already missing before I arrived last week?  Either way we are 
glad we where lured to that beautiful park on top of a extinct volcano in the 
middle of Portland, Oregan.  Ginny lays over as a flight attendant in 
Clackamus lots and she will walk it soon.  The northwest blows our mind as 
it is our current "points of discovery" destination.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Moreover Mitch,  we never found the 
"Multnomah Falls" or "Wahkeena Falls Letterbox"(es).  
The Multnomah Falls clues 125 degrees from the falls and those five tree clues 
didn't seem enough to pinpoint even closely where we could start as I walked a 
straight line from the falls almost throught the gift shop to the railroad 
tracks and waist deep into the Columbia River. :))</div>
<div>I never saw any trees that looked like 
that.  A second compass bearing would have helped.  So as Austin 
Powers says, "Throw me a frigin Bone" please, ha!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Wahkeena Falls letter box is either missing 
or we just blew it.  Looking for that one walking up the path from the 
falls to the "resting place"  and then ahead to a "charred 
tree trunk"  we proceeded to tear up a nice hillside and moss looking 
under trunks of trees.  We abandoned the search for the above reason and 
checked bearings from the path.  Seemed the 40 degrees bearing of the 
"charred tree trunk"  put the place to the right of the path or 
up the hill whereas "resting place and tower in the water at 220 and 333 
respectively"  placed it below the path or downhill?  I will try 
that one again but I am stratching my head.  Nevertheless an absolute 
beautiful God recreated place that I hope all will visit and we will go after 
that "Triple Falls" stamp next time.  Thanks Mitch for guiding us 
there!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Regards,</div>

The Mt. Tabor letterbox is a tricky one. I believe it's still there...I<br/>
found it right off, but didn't think it could be the right spot, or that<br/>

I hid my first letterbox this weekend at a very beautifull spot on Mt.<br/>
Neahkahnie off of hwy 101 on the Oregon Coast. I didn't have a compass with<br/>
me, so the clue won't really be too hard .As soon as I write the clue and<br/>
scan my stamp (I carved it in the early a.m. while looking up at the<br/>
mountain from the beach...very peacefull and foggy), then I will put it on<br/>
the clues page.<br/>

Hi Cara,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for writing back and giving us another letterbox to pursue!  Ginny<br/>
didn't get to do the Mt. St. Helens hike to the summit due to a foot injury<br/>
while training for that hike.  I promised her and we will do it in 2000.<br/>
<br/>
re- the Mt Tabor LB, the clue pointed directly to a large tree, by a lamp<br/>
post and with a good size whole and perfect place to hide one.  It wasn't<br/>
more that 5 feet from that street.  Please tell me I was in the wrong place?<br/>
The compass reading was checked once, twice and three times.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to look your new letterbox up in the atlas now to see "where" it<br/>
is.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>
Greg<br/>
