I finally got up the courage to carve my first stamps. I used the <br/>
pink stuff and an exacto.<br/>
<br/>
I'm giving them to Mom to take when she goes on her trip to Portland <br/>
in a couple of weeks. The Film Fest is going on while she'll be <br/>
there so the stamps are themed for that.<br/>
<br/>
I made a folder in the files area and uploaded them. Here's the link <br/>
if you want to see them. http://tinyurl.com/36xrw<br/>
<br/>
I posted them for two reasons. (1) to show all those who sent me <br/>
encouraging email when I was nervous about trying it myself and (2) <br/>
to show anyone else who is new to this that being WORRIED about <br/>
carving is way worse than actually doing it.<br/>
