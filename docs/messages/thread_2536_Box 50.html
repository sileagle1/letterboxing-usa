the Cowboy and I when out on letterbox adventures or for an errand in <br/>
town.  The store keepers are happy to join in the "game" and will <br/>
keep an eye on the box. They are even looking to get in on the hobby.<br/>
While out yesterday with my crew two nephews and a niece visiting <br/>
they found their first boxes. They went to Grumpy , and Opening Day <br/>
in Mansfield Hollow both were fine. It was nice to see Wanda and <br/>
Pete, Melissa and Dan, And Larry Boy and Dino boy had been by. Fish <br/>
boy was most happy to take the prize left in the Opening day box. <br/>
Others who visited opted not to take it since they don't fish but by <br/>
his name you will know what fish boy does in his spare time, wait til <br/>
you see his mark. <br/>
   Hope everyone is enjoying a great letterboxing weekend <br/>
