Planted: 3/26/02<br/>

This walk can be as long or as short as you want it to be.  The box <br/>
is hidden in Laguna Lake Park in Fullerton, CA.<br/>
<br/>
The long way is only 1.8 miles.  You take the Bud Turner Trail to the <br/>
Lake. This trail begins at the corner of Euclid St. and Valencia Mesa <br/>
Dr. More information on the Bud Turner trail can be found at <br/>
http://www.ci.fullerton.ca.us/comm_serv/parks/trailsp1.html<br/>
<br/>
The short way is just a "drive-by".  You can enter Laguna Lake Park <br/>
from the corner of Hermosa and Lakeside.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues to the box:<br/>
<br/>
Walk around the lake counter-clockwise.<br/>
<br/>
You will come to a small picnic area (only 3 tables).  There will be <br/>
2 small wooden footbridges over man-made stonefilled streambeds and a <br/>
mile-marker that says 1/4.  At the mile marker post, take a compass <br/>
heading of approx. 75 degrees. (My compass has a bubble in it, so <br/>
this is only approximate)<br/>
<br/>
You should see a tree of 3 with a stumpy part too!  Inside the stump <br/>
part behind a piece of wood is the Easter Bunny Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Please use caution when poking into holes and reaching into <br/>
crevices.  Read the waiver of Responsibility and Liability.<br/>
<br/>
Also this is a busy little park.  Be discreet when stamping in. You <br/>
can take the box over to one of the picnic tables and then find the <br/>
right moment to return it to it's hiding place! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting<br/>
