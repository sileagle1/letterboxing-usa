                    <html><body>For a story on letterboxing to be published in June in the Washington Post, I would love to hear from any letterboxers or about any letterboxing adventures in the greater Washington, DC area--the District, Maryland, Virginia.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you would like to be identified by name (in which case, include please) or by your letterboxing "handle."<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to know what you enjoy about letterboxing, how you started, how long you have been doing it, any high points in your letterboxing experience, any misadventures, what suggestions you might have for someone trying letterboxing for the first time, and anything else you might think would be of interest.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!
