                    <div class="plaintext-content">Tom and I started letterboxing on May 16, 2003.  As of Saturday, we had found 33 boxes and one hitchhiker.  Sunday afternoon we headed to Mansfield.  When we were done (and ready to drop) about 8:00 Monday night (we took the day off from work), our new total is F77 HH2.  Not bad for 30 days into this wonderful adventure!!<br/>
<br/>
Here's the boxes we got and a little commentary:<br/>
- The Feed Store, Mansfield Depot<br/>
- Mansfield Depot Train Trestle<br/>
- The School House<br/>
- The Three Wizards series<br/>
- Circle of Life series<br/>
- Merrow Park (we also looked for Friendly Skies but couldn't find it)<br/>
- Music To My Ears, Chico y Frio Hermano and Winterfest - all three of these were found strewn about - we hunted down all the pieces and put them back in their hiding places - and cursed the vandals that got to these boxes!  Does it count for more if you have to REALLY hunt for the letterboxes?!<br/>
- My Favorite Musicals - it took us 5 hours to do this series but it was a lot of fun!  We didn't find Phantom of the Opera, Marta, or Shirley Temple.  But, we did find another letterbox that we didn't have clues for called Spring, Spring, Spring.  Anyone know anything about this one?<br/>
- Tiger Cub<br/>
- Barrows Pond<br/>
- In Search of Sasquatch<br/>
- Mansfield Centre General Store<br/>
- The John Storrs house<br/>
- Happy Birthday<br/>
- Southeast School<br/>
- Under the Pines<br/>
<br/>
What a great weekend!  We did have to wonder why there are so many letterboxes in Mansfield.  Any thoughts?  Whatever it is, we're really appreciative that we live in Connecticut!!<br/>

I had a fit when I saw that I replied to the list !! But the damage was<br/>
done.  You were right not to post the bonus . I can only hope that no<br/>
one noticed my posting !! Now I will tell you that if you notice the<br/>
'type- subject' of the box that you found that bonus in,  there are 10<br/>
more Falling Leaves out there all in CT. and all are  bonus boxes<br/>
playing off that kind of box. !! it pays to read the log book !!<br/>
Have fun<br/>
