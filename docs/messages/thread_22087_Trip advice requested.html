                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, it looks like we've finally decided on a vacation destination.   <br/>
Niagara Falls.   So I'm looking for advice on what boxes are good, both there and <br/>
along the way.   The catch is that I'll be traveling with an impatient husband <br/>
who just loves to give me a hard time about stopping too much.<br/>
<br/>
So, what I'm looking for are boxes that either are very fast--like at a rest <br/>
stop--or that have a really cool setting, so he won't mind going there.   I've <br/>
found a couple like that, but was just wondering if anyone had any inside <br/>
knowledge of any more. <br/>
<br/>
Once we're there, the restrictions can relax just a bit, but I still need to <br/>
make sure that I'm dragging him to fairly interesting places, not just a local <br/>
park that's very like most local parks, you know?<br/>
<br/>
And if anyone cares to share any WOM clues, I promise to guard them with my <br/>
life, hunt discreetly, and rehide very carefully!<br/>
<br/>
Here's our route:<br/>
<br/>
I-95 Fort Lauderdale to Columbia, SC<br/>
I-77 to Beckley, WV<br/>
US-19 to I-79<br/>
I-79 to Erie, PA<br/>
I-90 to Niagara Falls<br/>
<br/>
We'll be spending time on both sides of the border.   I haven't been able to <br/>
find clues for any boxes in the area on the Canadian side, but I'd sure love <br/>
to find one.   It'd be my first one outside the US.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br/>

that involves some research beforehand, try "Love Canal".  I don't <br/>

planting one.<br/>

Plant one now!   Or at least before July 20!   <g><br/>

Seriously, thanks for the recommendations!<br/>
