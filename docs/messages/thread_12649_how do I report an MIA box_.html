I wouldn't give up on a box just because you didn't find it on your <br/>
first trip out.  I give a box at least 2 separate trips before I <br/>
even start to consider boxes missing.  That being said, I know The <br/>
Mighty Oak was there a year ago (I found it on my second trip but <br/>
found the Flight of the Hawk on my first) and after I read its log <br/>
book, it took most people multiple trips to find it.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe if I have some time this weekend, I'll see if I can find it <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
My advice, try again.  Sometimes missing boxes aren't really missing.<br/>

wondered when you see that a clue is reported as MIA if it's possible <br/>
that just one person didn't do a thorough job of hunting and decided <br/>
to report it, but really the box is still there.  Maybe I'll make it <br/>
a project to hunt down MIA boxes - although that might be a sure path <br/>
to disappointment.<br/>
