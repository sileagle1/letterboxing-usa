                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I reckon there's a larger population per square mile up there <br/>
than in say, New Mexico, or Arkansas.  Folks in the south tend to be <br/>
out doors more of the year, so I hear, so maybe that's a <br/>
factor...northerners are anxious to get out doors when they <br/>
can?  Some southerners spend their out door time hunting, fishing, <br/>
boating, gardening, mowing the yard that grows like crazy, etc. and <br/>
maybe don't have as much time for letterboxing as others?   Let's <br/>
see,,, I could speculate lots more, but really I don't know... it'd <br/>
all be speculation.  :-)<br/>

&gt;My LbNA region is northern NY and I have seen it grow by 4 times over<br/>
&gt;the past 3 years. I have noticed a little more new local traffic in my<br/>
&gt;more popular boxes. I have also noticed that there is a large number of<br/>
&gt;boxers from NE, particularly Ct.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why is that? Is letterboxing more organized in there area?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Are their more gatherings or events that help build interest and help<br/>
&gt;people develop their carving skills?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Are there clubs or other organizations that people actually meet face<br/>
&gt;to face?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am interested in your thoughts on this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you,<br/>
