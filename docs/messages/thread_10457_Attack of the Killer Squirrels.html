                    <html><body>Beware!  The squirrels of Washington, DC have united and they are on attack.<br/>
<br/>
Today, Scott and I set out to pick up some of the many DC microboxes.  Had a great time - saw a lot of monuments and little parks that I have never been to before.  Finally we headed to the Taft Memorial Box.  We found the box, no problem, and decided to sit down on a park bench to stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
We weren't on the bench more than 20 seconds before we were suddenly SURROUNDED by squirrels!  There was about ten of them, and they circled the entire park bench.  Scott and I said "Ha ha... look at all the squirrels!  Sorry little guys, we don't have any food for you today!"  Well, the ring of squirrels started getting smaller and smaller.  I felt something on my foot.  It was a squirrel - sitting on my shoe.  "No, no little squirrel!  go away!  I have no food for you!"    Then I look to my right, and there is a squirrel sitting next to me on the park bench, with another one climbing up behind it.  The next thing we knew, there was a squirrel climbing up Scott's leg.  He shooed it away with his log book.  It came back and did it again.  By this time, I was laughing so hard, my sides hurt.  Finally, I had to hand all of the letterboxing stuff to Scott.  He stamped in while I ran around the park bench in circles trying to chase the squirrels away.  They just kept coming after us!  So much for trying not to draw any attention to ourselves.  I'm sure all the DC tourists that were walking by must have thought I was completely insane - running in circles around a park bench, yelling at squirrels.<br/>
<br/>
Scott finally got us stamped in and handed the microbox back to me to replace it.  As soon as I left the park bench, another squirrel ran up Scott's leg, and up his arm to his shoulder.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been laughing about this all day and wanted to share!<br/>
<br/>
So, beware all you DC area letterboxers!  If you go to the Taft memorial - bring a bag of peanuts!!<br/>
