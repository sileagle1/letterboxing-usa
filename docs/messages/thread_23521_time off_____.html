I hope you will be able to get a handle on your depression.  It sounds<br/>
as if it has been sinking fairly deep for you.  That can be so<br/>
discouraging and make the world feel quite bleak sometimes.  I hope<br/>
you don't give up on all the stuff that has brought you joy.  That<br/>
doesn't sound like a great solution.  Moderation is always good. <br/>
Depression tends to make everything seem so black and white.<br/>
<br/>
Know that we are cheering you on and our thoughts will be with you.  I<br/>
hope you will be able to gain the upper hand in this next battle.<br/>
<br/>
With concern,<br/>

Take the time you need to get the upper hand on your depression. If there is<br/>
anything we can do, please let us know. While we do not suffer from<br/>
depression, we do know that when our schedules get too crazy or life comes<br/>
at us full tilt, it's better to back off from activities, get back to family<br/>
and job basics and heal. Rest assured that letterboxing will be here when<br/>
you are feeling better.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We'll be waiting for you when you return,<br/>
