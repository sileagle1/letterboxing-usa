<br/>
     You must have faith in the investigator that you,<br/>
yourself, have hired. It has taken many hours to<br/>
dumpster dive into your site. Just when I have a<br/>
handle on the suspect another one is thrown in. Was it<br/>
not you, Der Mad Stamper, who told me that this was a<br/>
close-knit community? I see an immense amount of mud<br/>
slinging here, a tremendous amount of name-calling.<br/>
<br/>
     I do believe my fee has just doubled.<br/>
<br/>
     As I am depriving myself of sleep with many hours<br/>
of research you make accusations of my snoozing on<br/>
I-5! Do you have any comprehension of how complicated<br/>
your hobby is? Is there a letterbox at the Applegate<br/>
Rest Stop?<br/>
<br/>
     You will hear more from me as my investigation<br/>
continues. Never fear I will solve this case. <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
Investigator Francis Bacon<br/>
<br/>

This appears to me to be the work of more than one individual. It could <br/>
even be as many as 12. All accused have partial alibis and all alibis <br/>
have holes. Maybe you need to start investigating any known "groups" of <br/>
individuals. Here are a couple thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
The Baker's Dozen - It is a well known fact that this group has grown <br/>
into a tightly knit group. They may have been planning this heist since <br/>
2004 and have recently pulled it off in preparation of an upcoming trip <br/>
back to Dartmoor.<br/>
<br/>
Event Organizers - In preparation for an event there usually is a <br/>
flurry of carving going on. This premium medium becomes a hot <br/>
commodity. Are there any planned events near Der Mad Stampers home turf?<br/>
