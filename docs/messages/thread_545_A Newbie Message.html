<br/>
Here's a newbie opinion about the new Newsletter Layout...Looks Great!!  The<br/>
only thing that I would like is the heading (which is very cool) to be a bit<br/>
smaller in depth.  I prefer minimal scrolling through a page.  My feelings<br/>
won't be hurt if you don't act on my suggestion. I really understand how<br/>
difficult it can be some times to design by committee, and the designer's<br/>
vision is usually best.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I have finally got the nerve to write I have a question...  My<br/>
niece, nephew and I have all kinds of ideas where to put letterboxes, but I<br/>
don't know how do I get the clues to a letterbox that I am planning to<br/>
place, on the web site?  And what are some other ways to provide clues to<br/>
interested parties?  Mailings?<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the issues of carved stamp vs. bought stamp, I agree with many of<br/>
you that any stamp as long as there was some thought put into it and or the<br/>
clues.  I have found that art groups that start to exclude or discourage<br/>
participation due to level of creativity or skill are typically directed by<br/>
snotty people that like to feel superior to others and have control.  Other<br/>
groups that I have been part of that are always encouraging,<br/>
non-judgemental, and supportive, foster a much more fruitful, creative, and<br/>
fun environment for everyone.  Everyone thrives!<br/>
<br/>
AH Oh...Now that I've found my voice I can't stop...<br/>
<br/>
I found your site about 2 weeks ago, and (counter to my personality) joined<br/>
immediately.  I am very excited about going out for the hunt and creating<br/>
new boxes.  This whole idea speaks VERY LOUDLY to the little kid in me.  I<br/>
have always loved the idea of treasure hunting AND I've been carving stamps<br/>
for 9+ years and REALLY love it.  Not to mention my love of the outdoors. <br/>
What could be better!!!<br/>
<br/>
I go to a rubber stamp carving retreat every year and this year I am going<br/>
to create temporary letterboxes for the immediate area of the retreat,<br/>
explain the activity to everyone (give them all the background and web site<br/>
information) and give them the clues.  If they want to participate in the<br/>
hunt they can throughout the weekend, and maybe they will become interested<br/>
in joining your group.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going after my 1st letterbox this week... the Circle X.  I can't wait!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting,  Wendy<br/>

Temporary letterboxes, what a great idea to show people about letterboxing!<br/>
That would be good for Scouts, schools and Church groups (DVBS). Something<br/>

This is a good question.  For the most part, all you need to do is post your <br/>
clues to this Talk List.  The webmasters will then take care of the rest for <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
If you have the ability and resources to publish your own webpages, you might <br/>
prefer to publish the clues yourself and just send us the link.  Either way <br/>
is acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people have suggested that there should be something on the website <br/>
that explains the procedure for submitting clues, so I have added a link to <br/>
the JOIN page that should help you understand the various options that are <br/>
available.  Hope you find it useful.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you in all your letterboxing activities.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mitch (Der Mad Stamper)<br/>

What an enthusiatic first contact!  From the things you wrote, you'll<br/>
fit right in very nicely!<br/>
&gt;  And what are some other ways to provide clues to<br/>
&gt;  interested parties?  Mailings?<br/>
Sounds like you are doing just that, at the stamp carving retreat! Just<br/>
tell people that you think might have an interest. Tom Cooch, for<br/>
example, has found ways to involve his students, and kids from the local<br/>
library. Thom Cheny has involved his RV Club in Letterboxing. I've been<br/>
less successful, altho I didsend Letterboxing kits as Christmas gifts<br/>
this year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Regarding the issues of carved stamp vs. bought stamp, I agree with many of<br/>
&gt;  you that any stamp as long as there was some thought put into it and or the<br/>
&gt;  clues.  I have found that art groups that start to exclude or discourage<br/>

&gt;  groups that I have been part of that are always encouraging,<br/>
&gt;  non-judgemental, and supportive, foster a much more fruitful, creative, and<br/>
&gt;  fun environment for everyone.  Everyone thrives!<br/>
<br/>
	Very well spoken indeed. Whatever one stamp chooses to place in a<br/>
letterbox is a matter of personal choice - whether hand made or not is<br/>
not an issue. But, I agree that some thought should be paid to the image<br/>
selected and the location....<br/>
<br/>
	I also think it might be fun to have a section of the LBNA web page<br/>
devoted to screw-ups made while trying to carve the perfect stamp. You<br/>
know, mis-spelled words, backwards letters, that sort of thing. It might<br/>
help those new carvers who are afraid to show their work that everyone<br/>
makes "misteaks" more often than we care to admit!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I found your site about 2 weeks ago, and (counter to my personality) joined<br/>
&gt;  immediately. <br/>
<br/>
	How did you first hear of letterboxing? Now that the Smithsonian<br/>
article is over 1 year old, other avenues of exposure need to be<br/>
developed successfully.  Was your discovery an ourgrowth of  your<br/>
stamp-carving web links?<br/>
<br/>
 I am very excited about going out for the hunt and creating<br/>
&gt;  new boxes.  This whole idea speaks VERY LOUDLY to the little kid in me.  I<br/>

<br/>
	Yup, that was the hook that brought me (&amp; perhaps most of us) into this<br/>

&gt; <br/>

	This retreat sounds wonderful!  Where is it located? I can think of a<br/>
few folks who would love to go there (my wife and I included!).<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, welcome aboard. I look forward to seeing your clues. And, if you<br/>
are so inclined, some of your stamps.<br/>

This really could be very funny and certainly encouraging to those that have<br/>
just started carving.<br/>

&gt;stamp-carving web links?<br/>
<br/>
Yep.  One of my customers (I'm a consultant) is a company called The Parks<br/>
Company (you all might be interested in their products, they are all related<br/>
to the National Parks and a percentage of every sale goes to support the<br/>
Parks.  www.theparksco.com), and they requested that I check out the webring<br/>
site.  Whenever I'm checking out a new search engine I put in Rubber Stamp,<br/>
and wha-la...Letterboxing.  I found it at about 10:30 in the evening, hunted<br/>
around and read, read, read.  When I finally went to bed I couldn't sleep,<br/>
thinking all about the different places that I would like to place a box,<br/>
the images that I want to carve, and the process to get it done.  It was<br/>
interesting timing as I was taking a friend to the airport at 6 AM (major<br/>
yawn), who also was the one that turned me on to carving.  I talked her ear<br/>
off about letterboxing all the way to the airport and then again when she<br/>
returned 5 days later.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yup, that was the hook that brought me (&amp; perhaps most of us) into this<br/>

<br/>
PERFECT!!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This retreat sounds wonderful!  Where is it located? I can think of a<br/>

<br/>
The retreat is called STAMPFEST, and is held at La Casa De Maria, Monticeto,<br/>
Calif.  The next one is November 19-22.  It is hosted by "A Stamp In The<br/>
Hand", (Phone: 310 329-8555) a rubber stamp company that you may have heard<br/>
of.  Space is very limited so call soon if you are interested.  I've been<br/>
gone the past 8 years and wouldn't miss it for anything.  It is always a<br/>
great and eclectic group of people, with wonderful creative energy, lots of<br/>
laughing, carving, sharing and non-judgemental support.  Kat, (owner of A<br/>
Stamp In The Hand) always arranges for some really fun seminars during the<br/>
weekend, and everyone typically participates in a card exchange.  What else<br/>
would you like to know?  I could talk all night about it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Anyhow, welcome aboard. I look forward to seeing your clues. And, if you<br/>
&gt;are so inclined, some of your stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much for the WELCOME.  I'm not sure how good I'm going to be<br/>
at clues... I think my strength is going to be the carving.  I would be<br/>
happy to share images, but currently my scanner is not hooked up.  I would<br/>
be happy to send them to someone to scan and share, all I need is an address<br/>
and an idea of what you would like to see.  (I'm not planning to share the<br/>
images that I carve for the letterbox so that it is a surprise for the<br/>
hunter.)<br/>
<br/>
I'm so excited!!  Wendy<br/>

I'm sure that you have probably heard of RUBBERSTAMPMADNESS.  They<br/>
occasionally do articles on Rubber stamp carving.  Last issue they did an<br/>
article on a group call RAPS, which is a mail art group that carves (I use<br/>
to belong).<br/>

See I just can't stop now that I started.<br/>

&gt;What an enthusiatic first contact!  From the things you wrote, you'll<br/>
&gt;fit right in very nicely!<br/>
<br/>
Ditto.  Very exciting.  I think your fever may be contagious.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; I also think it might be fun to have a section of the LBNA web page<br/>
&gt;devoted to screw-ups made while trying to carve the perfect stamp. You<br/>
&gt;know, mis-spelled words, backwards letters, that sort of thing. It might<br/>
&gt;help those new carvers who are afraid to show their work that everyone<br/>
&gt;makes "misteaks" more often than we care to admit!<br/>
<br/>
EXCELLENT idea.  But maybe we ought to put it on the back burner, there seems to be quite a bit doing right now already.  I do have several candidates though.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; How did you first hear of letterboxing? Now that the Smithsonian<br/>
&gt;article is over 1 year old, other avenues of exposure need to be<br/>
&gt;developed successfully.  Was your discovery an ourgrowth of  your<br/>
&gt;stamp-carving web links?<br/>
<br/>
Mitch, is it possible to set the list up such that when someone joins a question would ask them how they found out about us?  I think this would be very interesting to track.  (Can you tell I'm a Market Research consultant?)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yup, that was the hook that brought me (&amp; perhaps most of us) into this<br/>
&gt;hobby - stamping, art, treasure hunting, outdoors - a perfect hobby.<br/>
<br/>
All of the above, PLUS an excellent excuse to go online AND a hobby where you participate on two very opposite levels (as a "seeker" and a "hider").  I can think of very few hobbies where this is possible ON YOUR OWN TIME!.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  the Letterbox Series site. Did you announce this while I was <br/>
&gt;  sleeping, or did you modestly let this go by unheralded? It is a <br/>
&gt;  spectacular addition!!!!!!! The two series you have started with are <br/>
&gt;  great choices, and I am sure we will all come up with many more.<br/>
<br/>
Randy, you're just too modest or sneaky, I haven't figured out which yet!  BTW, I've switched my clues to my own webspace to leave more space on Mitch's for others.  (The link to Circle X on your series list needs to be updated)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;And what are some other ways to provide clues to<br/>
&gt;interested parties?  Mailings?<br/>
<br/>
That reminds me: Isn't there a stamp floating around in the mail somewhere?  Or did I just dream that?  <br/>
Wendy, some letterboxing clues can be found in letterboxes too from what I hear :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I'm going after my 1st letterbox this week... the Circle X.  I can't wait!!<br/>
<br/>
Wendy, my heart goes BOOM BOOM BOOM just at the thought of it.  I wonder if you'll be the first to hunt for it since I placed it in early March.  I have another business trip coming up that brings me to California mid-July so I was going to check on my baby.  Let us know how you make out!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, since I'm coming out there, would you just love to hide a letterbox for me to find !!!!!!!  I'll be in LA for 3 days and SF for 5, so I'll let you choose :o)<br/>
<br/>
What a flurry of activity this weekend,  Very Exciting!!!<br/>

&gt;  Thank you so much for your reply!!  You all sound like SO MUCH FUN!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt; I also think it might be fun to have a section of the LBNA web page<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;  This really could be very funny and certainly encouraging to those that have<br/>
&gt;  just started carving.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;  I found your site about 2 weeks ago, and (counter to my personality) joined<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;  immediately. <br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; How did you first hear of letterboxing? Now that the Smithsonian<br/>
&gt;  &gt;article is over 1 year old, other avenues of exposure need to be<br/>
&gt;  &gt;developed successfully.  Was your discovery an ourgrowth of  your<br/>
&gt;  &gt;stamp-carving web links?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Yep.  One of my customers (I'm a consultant) is a company called The Parks<br/>
&gt;  Company (you all might be interested in their products, they are all related<br/>
&gt;  to the National Parks and a percentage of every sale goes to support the<br/>
&gt;  Parks.  www.theparksco.com), and they requested that I check out the webring<br/>
&gt;  site.  Whenever I'm checking out a new search engine I put in Rubber Stamp,<br/>
&gt;  and wha-la...Letterboxing.  I found it at about 10:30 in the evening, hunted<br/>
&gt;  around and read, read, read.  When I finally went to bed I couldn't sleep,<br/>
&gt;  thinking all about the different places that I would like to place a box,<br/>
&gt;  the images that I want to carve, and the process to get it done.  It was<br/>
&gt;  interesting timing as I was taking a friend to the airport at 6 AM (major<br/>
&gt;  yawn), who also was the one that turned me on to carving.  I talked her ear<br/>
&gt;  off about letterboxing all the way to the airport and then again when she<br/>
&gt;  returned 5 days later.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt; Yup, that was the hook that brought me (&amp; perhaps most of us) into this<br/>
&gt;  &gt;hobby - stamping, art, treasure hunting, outdoors - a perfect hobby.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  PERFECT!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt; This retreat sounds wonderful!  Where is it located? I can think of a<br/>
&gt;  &gt;few folks who would love to go there (my wife and I included!).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  The retreat is called STAMPFEST, and is held at La Casa De Maria, Monticeto,<br/>
&gt;  Calif.  The next one is November 19-22.  It is hosted by "A Stamp In The<br/>
&gt;  Hand", (Phone: 310 329-8555) a rubber stamp company that you may have heard<br/>
&gt;  of.  Space is very limited so call soon if you are interested. <br/>
<br/>
Thamks for the reply. Being a Vermonter, I suppose it was just too much<br/>
to hope for the Stamp Carving Retreat to be on this side of the country.<br/>
Dang!.  Well, Susan and I are pretty new to stamp carving - who knows<br/>
what will turn up here.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your letterboxes<br/>

Thank you also for the warm welcome.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;Wendy, some letterboxing clues can be found in letterboxes too from what I hear :-)<br/>
<br/>
Cool!! Another reason to hunt and another idea for my letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;I'm going after my 1st letterbox this week... the Circle X.  I can't wait!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wendy, my heart goes BOOM BOOM BOOM just at the thought of it.  I wonder if <br/>
&gt;you'll be the first to hunt for it since I placed it in early March.  I <br/>
&gt;have another business trip coming up that brings me to California mid-July <br/>
&gt;so I was going to check on my baby.  Let us know how you make out!<br/>
<br/>
WOW it has been a long time since I've made a man's heart go BOOM BOOM BOOM,<br/>
too bad I didn't find out about this sooner.  I will of course write about<br/>
my 1st adventure.  AND thank you for placing a box close enough to me that I<br/>
can go hunt without a major trip planned.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;BTW, since I'm coming out there, would you just love to hide a letterbox <br/>
&gt;for me to find !!!!!!!  I'll be in LA for 3 days and SF for 5, so I'll let <br/>
&gt;you choose :o)<br/>
<br/>
I would be happy to place a box for you.  I won't be up in SF between now<br/>
and then so LA is the place.  I'll put out the clues before I leave for<br/>
Portland (yes I'm planning to do some hunting while on a business trip to<br/>
Portland) on the 9th, will that be soon enough?  I was planning to place the<br/>
box in an area that I go for a walk regularly.  It is not a designated<br/>
recreational area but it is still "wild", has a beautiful view on a clear<br/>
day, but not out of site of civilization.  Would that be OK?  I'm hoping so<br/>
because I know the area so well which will help me to create my 1st box.  <br/>
<br/>
Yipee<br/>

someone sooooo very far away.  Truly boggles my mind.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for your warm welcome.  The first night that I was reading<br/>
about letterboxing, all I could think about is how could I get myself over<br/>
to Dartmoor for a Month of hunting.  I even tried different book sellers to<br/>
try and buy one of the books that was mentioned in the Smithsonian article. <br/>
Now that I am over the initial adrenaline surge I'm happy to hunt here at<br/>
home for awhile.<br/>

Hi Wendy,<br/>
<br/>
One more welcome to you from me...   I am bumming...  would have tried<br/>
to hook up with you while you are here in Portland next month.<br/>
Unfortunately (okay... not so unfortunate), I'll be in Alaska during<br/>
that time, so I will miss meeting you.  My good friend and neighbor<br/>
Mitch will be around &amp; our favorite pub is right up the hill.  Past<br/>
letterboxing events have occured there &amp; the atmosphere is just about<br/>
right for swapping stamps &amp; letterbox stories.  We might even coerce<br/>
Cara &amp; Kevin to drive over....<br/>
<br/>
You say you will be placing a box in the LA area.....!!  The month<br/>
following (Aug), I'll be in LA (this time for business).  What area of<br/>
LA are you considering placing your box?   My free time is limited, but<br/>
if I can wrangle my way out of a meeting or two, I might get some time<br/>
to hunt.  ...uuuhh... they still don't have blackberry brambles in LA,<br/>
do they? <br/>

<br/>
WOW... I would very much like to meet you all (can't you postpone your trip<br/>
to Alaska?...Just kidding).  I will be staying at the Lakeshore Motor Hotel<br/>
in Lake Oswego.  I was planning to rent a car Saturday or Sunday (I'm not<br/>
sure what day yet because I will be with other people and I'm not sure what<br/>
their plans are, other than I don't think they want to play letterboxing<br/>
with me) and go to the PCC for some hunting, and then depending on time go<br/>
to the Rock Creek hunting ground.  These both seemed to be the closest and<br/>
easiest (I'll save the Columbia Gorge boxes for when I am in better shape<br/>
and have a little more confidence).<br/>
<br/>
&gt;You say you will be placing a box in the LA area.....!!  The month<br/>
&gt;following (Aug), I'll be in LA (this time for business).  What area of<br/>
&gt;LA are you considering placing your box?   <br/>
<br/>
Without giving it away too much it will be about 25 minutes (35 min. if the<br/>
traffic is thick) South of LAX.  The hike for someone in moderate condition<br/>
only takes an hour (if you do the whole hike, which I never have because I'm<br/>
such a slug), so the box will be within those parameters. <br/>
<br/>
My free time is limited, but<br/>
&gt;if I can wrangle my way out of a meeting or two, I might get some time...<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to get together for a hunting celebration (this goes for<br/>
anyone that comes my way, Lone Wolf?, now that I know that it is OK to<br/>
fraternize in person), I live off the Blvd to the hiking site.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  ...uuuhh... they still don't have blackberry brambles in LA,<br/>
do they? <br/>
<br/>
I am ashamed to say that I don't know.  But there are rattle snakes, ticks,<br/>
poisen oak, etc. just to add to the little adventure.<br/>
<br/>
DAMN this is sooo fun!!<br/>

&gt; I would be happy to place a box for you.  I won't be up in SF between now<br/>
&gt; and then so LA is the place.  I'll put out the clues before I leave for<br/>
&gt; Portland (yes I'm planning to do some hunting while on a business trip to<br/>
&gt; Portland) on the 9th, will that be soon enough?  I was planning to place the<br/>
&gt; box in an area that I go for a walk regularly.  It is not a designated<br/>
&gt; recreational area but it is still "wild", has a beautiful view on a clear<br/>
&gt; day, but not out of site of civilization.  Would that be OK?  I'm hoping so<br/>
&gt; because I know the area so well which will help me to create my 1st box.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yipee<br/>
&gt; <br/>
I'm landing in LA on the 13th.  Perfect Timing.  I think it would be wonderful to have you put your 1st box in a place that's special to you.  I can't wait!!!<br/>

I'll go up today and scout "the spot".<br/>
<br/>
I'm back from my trip to Portland on the 12th, so if you would like to meet<br/>
let me know (Please don't let me put you on the spot, my feelings won't be<br/>
hurt if you can't).<br/>

Hi Wendy,<br/>
<br/>
 My good friend and neighbor Mitch will be around &amp; our favorite pub is<br/>
right up the hill.  Past letterboxing events have occured there &amp; the<br/>
atmosphere is just about right for swapping stamps &amp; letterbox stories.  We<br/>
might even coerce Cara &amp; Kevin to drive over....<br/>

We'd love to come and meet you Wendy, and it would be great to meet Mitch as<br/>
well! Kevin and I have yet to meet real live Letterboxers :) Too bad Thom<br/>
will be out of town Thom, although I'm sure you will enjoy Alaska (it's too<br/>
early for the killer mosquito's, right?) The 9th works for us, as does the<br/>
10th but we may be in Seattle on the 11th for a Dragon Boat race.  Let's<br/>
work out the details...<br/>

uhh... prolly not... I'm sure they will have thawed out just in time for<br/>
my visit.  If they are related to the angry hoards I experienced in<br/>
northern Alberta, it could get exciting.  We used to play canadian<br/>
roulette... stick your hand out the window for 60 seconds... the one<br/>
with the most bugs wins.... anyone hit by a bumblebee is immediately<br/>
disqualified.<br/>
