<p>General Lyonâ€™s Birthplace</p><b>
<p>Placed: 1-26-02</p>
<p>Placed By: Chuck Straub and his dog Molly</p>
<p>Location: Eastford Connecticut, Windham County</p>
<p>Rated: Moderate</p>
<p>Take into account that hunting is allowed in this Forest. Bright clothing 
would be advised even though this is a blue blazed hiking trail. </p>
<p>Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon was the first Union General killed in the 
Civil War. He is credited with saving Missouri for the Union and losing his life 
in the process. All that remains of his birthplace is a large stone fireplace 
and chimney. </p></b><b>
<p>Proceed to the main entrance of the Natchaug Forest which has a shield shaped 
state sign and is on the east side of route 198 in Eastford. 5  miles past the 
intersection of routes 198 and 6 in Chaplin and about 3 miles south of route 44. 
After entering the park, go over the bridge spanning the Natchaug river. Good 
fishing on this river and many nice picnic spots with tables. Go up the long 
winding hill until you get to a Y intersection. Bear left towards the Natchaug 
Forest HQ and pass the old CCC grounds. From the Y intersection, travel 6/10 of 
a mile down this road. You will see the entrance to the homestead ruins on the 
left. Pull in here and park along side the road that goes around the standing 
fireplace of the old homestead. This would also be a nice place for a picnic 
lunch. Tables are available here also. Walk to the NW part of the field and 
follow the blue blazed trees down a dirt road over a small stream. The trail 
turns right and you will quickly come to a 4 way intersection. Go straight, down 
the blue blazed trail. After walking about 20 minutes or more from your car, the 
trail will be up on a ridge with a stone wall following the left side of the 
trail. On the bottom of the hill is the Natchaug River. The trail will turn away 
from the wall. After about a 10 minute walk, the trail passes through a stone 
wall. This is the only stone wall that the trail has passed through. Stop at 
this wall. On the south side of the stone wall follow the wall east. You come to 
a corner of the wall. Cross over this and continue following the same wall. You 
will pass 2 large oaks that almost touch the wall and then come to a large oak 
that has a large hollowed out area near the bottom and the upper part of the 
tree has been split in half. In the hollowed out area is your prize, covered by 
sticks and leafs. Backtrack to get to your car.
