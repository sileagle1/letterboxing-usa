On August 21, 2002 Funhog placed the Mountain View Letterbox <br/>
near the town of Mt. Shasta, Shasta County, California. If you <br/>
need to stretch your legs while driving I-5, this is the perfect <br/>
place to do it. The trail is only ten minutes from the freeway but a <br/>
world apart in terms of atmosphere. The box may be <br/>
inaccessible during the winter months. The view of the mountain <br/>
from the letterbox is filtered through the trees but all along the <br/>
highway you will be treated its breathtaking glory.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: from the stoplight at E. Lake and Mt. Shasta <br/>
Blvd. in the center of town, head uphill on E. Lake which will <br/>
become the Everitt Memorial Highway (A-10.) About five miles <br/>
past the high school (Go Bears!) you will come to the McBride <br/>
Springs Campground. A quarter mile beyond this point, at mile <br/>
marker 4, park on the right side in a large turnout.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: Cross the road and head up the trail. Just when <br/>
you can no longer see the road over your shoulder you will come <br/>
to a small clearing with four tall Ponderosa pines and a stump. <br/>
About 150 steps further up the path veer left between two sawn <br/>
logs. Cross a rocky stream bed (dry in August.) Just before the <br/>
trail makes a sharp right turn you will meet a row of stone-faced <br/>
guardians gazing across the path at a lone manzanita, a <br/>
ponderous neighbor guarding their backs. The largest of the <br/>
guards has a second charge in its safekeeping, a letterbox.<br/>
