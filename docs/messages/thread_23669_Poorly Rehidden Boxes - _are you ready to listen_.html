 One of my first finds looked like that as well as several others since..too many others. Aside from the folks who just throw them back onto the ground, I attribute some of the uncoverings to non-boxers, animals and weather conditions. I've seen a few hollow logs torn apart by folks looking for a box, no doubt the reason that stone walls are a sore spot for some. I found a few day old box laying on the ground and a crack pipe stuck in it's hiding spot. Found a lonely box washed down from it's spot onto a trail. Found one mangled up by a mowing machine, on and on.<br/>

You know, I am not a big fan of most of the changes to LBNA but I think requiring folks to login to get clues is a great idea. However, they can still use a fake email addr and never receive our messages, but they don't know that. It might deter the average knucklehead. Just remember the old adage "Nothing is foolproof to the sufficiently talented fool" And you're right Sue, your feathers are rarely ruffled!<br/>

<br/>
If the box was not in a secure hiding spot in the first place, rather just sitting behind a tree with a pile of loose sticks and leaves covering it, the chances are greatly increased that animals and weather will contribute to the box being exposed.  Not to mention a suspicious pile of sticks behind a tree is an invitation for a non-letterboxer to stop and investigate.<br/>

When attempting to *rehide* a box that was not hidden well to begin with or is located in a place that offers little in the way of a natural, secure hiding spot, you do the best you can, but there is only so much you can do with a pile of twigs and some leaves.  On the other hand, if the box is tucked inside a hollow log or stump or a crevice in the rocks, etc. it is much easier to rehide because there is a natural hiding spot to work with.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that there are many reasons that boxes end up laying out in the open -- vandals, animals, weather, muggles, careless letterboxers -- but I really feel the hiding spot itself is also a significant factor.<br/>

<br/>
  Just a thought... the last person to have stamped into a letterbox is not NECESSARILY the one who hid it poorly. Often, boxes can be moved out of place by animals (espeically if there is an outer bag), or might have been found by non-letterboxers, who are unlikely to stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
  I'm not disagreeing with the problem of boxes being rehidden poorly. Just cautioning that you may not want to fire off "Here's How To Rehide A Box" e-mails to someone just because they were the last finder in the log book.<br/>

  This morning I read with dismay Mark Pepe's article, "Are You Ready <br/>
  to Listen" that shows a photo of a so-called "rehidden" Letterbox <br/>
  here in CT. For those who didn't see it, check the link below...<br/>
<br/>
  http://markandsuepepe.blogspot.com/<br/>
<br/>
  This is a peeve of mine that really burns me - people (and I don't <br/>
  refer to them as Letterboxers, as they haven't earned that title) <br/>
  who don't take the time or effort to rehide 'boxes properly! This <br/>
  subject comes up constantly and I truly believe that these posts are <br/>
  never even read by the culprits because they don't even subscribe to <br/>
  the lists let alone take the time or effort to LEARN about <br/>
  Letterboxing before venturing out all gung-ho to look for 'boxes.<br/>
<br/>
  Very often I've found my own 'boxes poorly rehidden (never as badly <br/>
  as in the photo though), and when I look online to see if the last <br/>
  person who signed into the logbook (presumably the one(s) who rehid <br/>
  them so badly) is a member of Letterboxing.org or a Yahoo group, 99% <br/>
  of the time they are NOT. There's no way of contacting them to <br/>
  explain the proper way to rehide a Letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
  SO THE POINT OF MY POST is to make a suggestion (it may have already <br/>
  been suggested, and I apologize for not having read it before). <br/>
  When accessing Letterboxing.org for clues, it is open for all to <br/>
  read and obtain clues. Perhaps if everyone has to "register" with a <br/>
  Trailname and Password as well as e-mail address in order to access <br/>
  the clues, then there would be a record of everyone who is out there <br/>
  looking for our Letterboxes. If all these names were in a "members" <br/>
  list with e-mail access, then we could contact them about their poor <br/>
  habits. (Of course, this totally depends on whether they sign the <br/>
  logbook with the trailname that they registered with...)<br/>
<br/>
  Choi, is this possible? And Choi, THANK YOU for all the hard work <br/>
  you continue to do for us as well as getting Letterboxing.org up and <br/>
  running again!<br/>
<br/>
  sojourner - whose feathers don't often get ruffled ;-)<br/>

I agree with SpringChick on this count. I'm not really convinced that<br/>
requiring people to log in will discourage people that do a lousy job<br/>

will make a *far* bigger impact for the longlevity of a box than the<br/>

<br/>
A good hiding place is idiot proofed. Animals can't push or move the<br/>
box from the hiding place. It doesn't require people to camoflauge the<br/>
box once it's replaced. It's planted on a location that if the box did<br/>
become exposed, it won't be in plain view of a trail or where people<br/>
will be. It's not planted at natural "stopping points" along a trail<br/>
such a beautiful view or scenic waterfall where people are more likely<br/>
to explore and discover the box.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to get upset at those who don't replace letterboxes<br/>
properly, you also need to get upset at the people who don't *plant*<br/>
letterboxes properly as well. There's a lot of them out there, and the<br/>
scary part is, they're already signed up with accounts and have their<br/>
time, money, and efforts invested in the box already!<br/>

  Well said, Ryan . I might add, pooly re-hidden/ pooly planted boxes, <br/>
while frustrating, will always be an issue. It's the nature of the <br/>
beast. Sadly, you can't make it go away with registrations or other <br/>
hoops. Just hope that it remains the exception, not the rule.<br/>
See you on the trail.  Kstar<br/>

 &gt; become exposed, it won't be in plain view of a trail or where people<br/>
 &gt; will be. It's not planted at natural "stopping points" along a trail<br/>
 &gt; such a beautiful view or scenic waterfall where people are more likely<br/>
 &gt; to explore and discover the box.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; If you want to get upset at those who don't replace letterboxes<br/>
 &gt; properly, you also need to get upset at the people who don't *plant*<br/>
 &gt; letterboxes properly as well. There's a lot of them out there, and the<br/>
 &gt; scary part is, they're already signed up with accounts and have their<br/>
 &gt; time, money, and efforts invested in the box already!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree that there are lots of things that can contribute to a box <br/>
being poorly rehidden...but I had an experience recently that was so <br/>
bizarre I wonder if it's ever happened before:   <br/>
<br/>
I have a box hidden in a fairly secluded spot in a public garden.  In <br/>
another area of the garden is an Asian pond with a stone pagoda beside <br/>
it.  I was enjoying the pond recently when I noticed what looked like <br/>
a Ziploc bag stuffed inside the pagoda.  I was excited because I was <br/>
pretty sure it was a letterbox, but I was dismayed at the openness of <br/>
the hiding place - it was in plain sight. Imagine my surprise when I <br/>
pulled it out and discovered it was my ownletterbox! The last few <br/>
entries in the logbook are hand-written and unsigned...apparently a <br/>
muggle found it and misinterpreted my instructions to "re-hide it <br/>
well" to mean "hide it somewhere else." What are the odds that I would <br/>
be the first to find it in it's new spot??  Needless to say, I've <br/>
changed my instructions to hopefully be more clear.<br/>

And it was Don - of Don &amp; Gwen - who came up with the name of "blessing the box" with ground cover. Thanks Don - who's the one who also penned the word "spamps" for those little pinecone stamps we received in the mail several years ago.

I dont't know thier full name). Two weeks ago while LBing i came <br/>
upon a homeless person. Who was living in a over grown bush not far <br/>
from the boxes location. So anything is possible. When I find one <br/>
that is not well hidden i rehide it well. I did see the posted <br/>
pictures. I find it hard to believe that someone (LBer) would really <br/>
leave the box that way. That looks more like someone found it and <br/>
just left it instead of distroying it. I would be very upset if i <br/>
recieved an e-mail telling me I didn't rehide a box good.I'm sure <br/>
others would too. I don't think people should start accusing others. <br/>

Just a thought... the last person to have stamped into a letterbox <br/>
is not NECESSARILY the one who hid it poorly.  Often, boxes can be <br/>
moved out of place by animals (espeically if there is an outer bag), <br/>
or might have been found by non-letterboxers, who are unlikely to <br/>
stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
  I'm not disagreeing with the problem of boxes being rehidden <br/>
poorly.  Just cautioning that you may not want to fire off "Here's <br/>
How To Rehide A Box" e-mails to someone just because they were the <br/>

          This morning I read with dismay Mark Pepe's article, "Are <br/>
You Ready <br/>
to Listen" that shows a photo of a so-called "rehidden" Letterbox <br/>
here in CT. For those who didn't see it, check the link below...<br/>
<br/>
http://markandsuepepe.blogspot.com/<br/>
<br/>
This is a peeve of mine that really burns me - people (and I don't <br/>
refer to them as Letterboxers, as they haven't earned that title) <br/>
who don't take the time or effort to rehide 'boxes properly! This <br/>
subject comes up constantly and I truly believe that these posts are <br/>
never even read by the culprits because they don't even subscribe to <br/>
the lists let alone take the time or effort to LEARN about <br/>
Letterboxing before venturing out all gung-ho to look for 'boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Very often I've found my own 'boxes poorly rehidden (never as badly <br/>
as in the photo though), and when I look online to see if the last <br/>
person who signed into the logbook (presumably the one(s) who rehid <br/>
them so badly) is a member of Letterboxing.org or a Yahoo group, 99% <br/>
of the time they are NOT. There's no way of contacting them to <br/>
explain the proper way to rehide a Letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
SO THE POINT OF MY POST is to make a suggestion (it may have already <br/>
been suggested, and I apologize for not having read it before). <br/>
When accessing Letterboxing.org for clues, it is open for all to <br/>
read and obtain clues. Perhaps if everyone has to "register" with a <br/>
Trailname and Password as well as e-mail address in order to access <br/>
the clues, then there would be a record of everyone who is out there <br/>
looking for our Letterboxes. If all these names were in a "members" <br/>
list with e-mail access, then we could contact them about their poor <br/>
habits. (Of course, this totally depends on whether they sign the <br/>
logbook with the trailname that they registered with...)<br/>
<br/>
Choi, is this possible? And Choi, THANK YOU for all the hard work <br/>
you continue to do for us as well as getting Letterboxing.org up and <br/>
running again!<br/>

Maybe this is why, back in letterboxing's ancient history, the clues were more cryptic and the searches more challenging.  By the time a searcher followed the trail to gather all the clues from wayside pubs and smoky inns, puzzled out the meanings, and crossed the moor to find the box--danged if he would want to make it easy for anyone else!<br/>

I absolutely love this!  It must have been so fun for the person who found<br/>
it and then looked around for a good new hiding place - and what a great<br/>
thing that you actually found it next!<br/>
<br/>
I'll make sure I specify for the box to be re-hidden in the same place in my<br/>
boxes from now on!<br/>
<br/>
And, regarding good hiding places... I've hidden boxes in places that are<br/>
not super secure.  I've accepted that they're more likely to go missing at<br/>
some point, but I like the places they're hidden for now.  I'm also doing my<br/>
best to keep an eye on them so that I can note it if/when they do disappear<br/>
so people don't end up looking for a box that isn't there - it seems a<br/>
common courtesy so as not to get people too frustrated.<br/>

We recently planted a series of 6, and I specifically note in my clues <br/>
that if the finder is NOT comfortable that the box will not be found <br/>
if rehidden, to remove it and contact us to rehide.<br/>
<br/>
Id rather a LB remove my box that may be at risk than a non-Lb'r.<br/>
<br/>
And that way, theres no stress if they feel uncomfortable leaving it, <br/>
but unsure about taking it. Theres no 'decision' for them to make, <br/>
they already know Im fine with it being removed if its at risk.<br/>

You know, I am not a big fan of most of the changes to LBNA but I think requiring folks to login to get clues is a great idea. However, they can still use a fake email addr and never receive our messages, but they don't know that. It might deter the average knucklehead. Just remember the old adage "Nothing is foolproof to the sufficiently talented fool" And you're right Sue, your feathers are rarely ruffled!<br/>

When accessing Letterboxing.org for clues, it is open for all to <br/>
read and obtain clues. Perhaps if everyone has to "register" with a <br/>
Trailname and Password as well as e-mail address in order to access <br/>
the clues, then there would be a record of everyone who is out there <br/>
looking for our Letterboxes. If all these names were in a "members" <br/>
list with e-mail access, then we could contact them about their poor <br/>
habits. (Of course, this totally depends on whether they sign the <br/>
logbook with the trailname that they registered with...)<br/>
<br/>
Choi, is this possible? And Choi, THANK YOU for all the hard work <br/>
you continue to do for us as well as getting Letterboxing.org up and <br/>

<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hardly -- the box is now covered with rocks and tucked into a<br/>
&gt; &gt; crevice, and the leaves just add some natural camouflage (fooled ya,<br/>
&gt; &gt; huh?).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sounds like it would have been easier to just take the box with you.<br/>
&gt; That's what I usually do.<br/>

<br/>
Now that my feathers are back to being unruffled and I've read <br/>
everyone's replies on the subject (thank you all for your input), <br/>
I've realized that it *does* pretty much boil down to what Ryan said <br/>
above...and I will rethink the hiding places of my own 'boxes, <br/>
keeping in mind to use Clueless and Silent Doug's "rock cubby hole" <br/>
technique when needed.  I think Sadie and Russ also hide some of <br/>
their boxes that way - it certainly does secure the 'boxes more than <br/>
leaves and sticks ever will!<br/>
Thanks for the enlightenment!<br/>

are <br/>
&gt; never even read by the culprits because they don't even subscribe <br/>

i have one box that has been in place for over 4 years. no cover to speak of<br/>
 camouflaged  tape for that reason, it is in a  busy park in view of anyone<br/>
who cares to bend over and look. now to an inexperienced boxer would it look<br/>
like my box is in danger? probably. and if truth be known, yes it is! but it<br/>
has survived 4 years and it is my choice to have it there. <br/>
<br/>
that being said i would be against anyone taking any of my boxes any where<br/>
with them because in their judgement they think the box is not safe. the<br/>
exception to this might be (and then again this is a might) a raging forest<br/>
fire, a flood that is taking it downstream, a hurricane coming around the<br/>
corner. if that was the case and they made the judgement call to take it<br/>
then they dang well better be contacting me asap and replacing it as soon as<br/>
the danger is over. <br/>
<br/>
i have rescued quite a few boxes that i made a judgement call on mother<br/>
nature destroying them. with that  i am okay. but to remove them for any<br/>
other reason? why not instead practice "rehide better than you found it"? <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Something I've done with the last few boxes that I've planted: write <br/>
the exact hiding spot on the back cover of the logbook. The trick is <br/>
to be brief enough to do it without using compass directions and <br/>
while using recognizeable landmarks. Not always easy in a new-growth <br/>
pine forest...<br/>

&gt; I absolutely love this!  It must have been so fun for the person <br/>
who found<br/>
&gt; it and then looked around for a good new hiding place - and what a <br/>
great<br/>
&gt; thing that you actually found it next!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll make sure I specify for the box to be re-hidden in the same <br/>
place in my<br/>
&gt; boxes from now on!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And, regarding good hiding places... I've hidden boxes in places <br/>
that are<br/>
&gt; not super secure.  I've accepted that they're more likely to go <br/>
missing at<br/>
&gt; some point, but I like the places they're hidden for now.  I'm <br/>
also doing my<br/>
&gt; best to keep an eye on them so that I can note it if/when they do <br/>
disappear<br/>
&gt; so people don't end up looking for a box that isn't there - it <br/>
seems a<br/>
&gt; common courtesy so as not to get people too frustrated.<br/>

&gt; &gt;    &gt; Hardly -- the box is now covered with rocks and tucked into <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; crevice, and the leaves just add some natural camouflage <br/>
(fooled ya,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; huh?). There were plenty of rocks around, so we made a non-<br/>
suspicious<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pile that looks completely natural. It's not my preference at <br/>
all to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; move lots of rocks around -- I'd rather find a natural hiding <br/>
place<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for my boxes -- but given the alternative, this seemed to be <br/>
much<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; better than leaving the box completely in the open.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Sounds like it would have been easier to just take the box with <br/>
you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; That's what I usually do.<br/>
