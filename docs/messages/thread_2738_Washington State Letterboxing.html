<br/>
John and I headed up to Tacoma yesterday and we managed to score Glenn<br/>
Hansen's Pt. Defiance and Tacoma Nature Center Snake Lake Letterboxes.<br/>
Trial &amp; Error, Mountain Scorpia and Amanda from Seattle have already<br/>
been to Pt. Defiance.  In fact, Amanda stamped in just a few days ago!<br/>
Only Trial &amp; Error and Amanda got to the Nature Center box.  We had a<br/>
heck of a time finding that one.  Thanks for great places to hike,<br/>
Glenn.  Especially Pt. Defiance.  What an excellent, scenic park!<br/>
Please plant more there!<br/>
<br/>
We were hoping to get the other Tacoma box, but didn't have a map and<br/>
time ran out.  We'll save that one and Dash Point for another day.  We<br/>
want to get Amanda's Schmitz Park series on another trip, as well.  <br/>
<br/>
It looks like I'll have to start plotting out a trip to Bellingham, too,<br/>
now, thanks to Amanda in Seattle!  Maybe that's where I will head for my<br/>
annual solo camping trip I take every year.  Seems as good a place as<br/>
any and all the more incentive with letterboxes lurking to be found!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
