this most boxious event? Ned and I had a wonderful time! Everyone is <br/>
always so supportive of kids at these things: on the way home Ned (11 <br/>
years old) was excitedly making plans for the next Gathering. Special <br/>
thanks to all who signed in to our Kiwi Konnection letterbox and <br/>
offered the Psychokiwis a fond farewell. We'll have it at the Mystery <br/>
Gathering for anyone who missed it, and then we'll gift it to Linton <br/>
and Judi to add to their baggage for New Zealand. I think they've got <br/>
about half a dozen or more boxes to make room for.<br/>
<br/>
As always it is so much fun to see old friends and make new ones at <br/>
these things. Such spirit! Why is it that the faces seem to match the <br/>
signature stamps? Cosmic.<br/>
