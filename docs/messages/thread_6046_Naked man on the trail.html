I had a slightly similar experience in Florida, on a trail I meant to scope <br/>
out for boxing.  However, "my" naked man did try to cover himself, and did <br/>
apologize.  I instantly recognized, because of previous observations of <br/>
traffic at the trailhead, that this guy was waiting for male "customers," <br/>
and he was not interested in me.  Besides, my dog was ready to take off his <br/>
gonads.<br/>
<br/>
If you like conversation-free solo hiking but don't have a dog, maybe you <br/>
could borrow one?  Not an "I love everybody" lab, but a small terrier <br/>
perhaps....?<br/>

Last month, while trying to make my way up a creek in Los Padres <br/>
Nat'l. Forest, I had to literally step over THREE naked people <br/>
sprawled out by a hot spring.  To make matters worse, nudists are <br/>
without exception, ALWAYS fido-ugly.  Does their organization have <br/>
some sort of bylaw which states, "no hotties allowed"???  For this <br/>
reason alone, naked people should be pelted with stones, &amp; I would <br/>
also agree with the suggestion of sicking your annoying lap dog on <br/>
them, if you have one with you.<br/>
