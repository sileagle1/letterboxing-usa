It sounds to me as if you are thinking of LBNA and the list as one and <br/>
the same.  They aren't.  LBNA is the main website for letterboxing <br/>
information and you can be contacted through that.  It is completely <br/>
separate from receiving emails from the letterbox-usa list.  I suspect <br/>
you gave LBNA your other address to register there and those are the <br/>
emails you are receiving.<br/>
<br/>
If that isn't the case and you are just asking about stuff from the <br/>
list, Yahoo only keeps addresses you give.  You can give a couple of <br/>
different addresses.  If you look in your membership details it tells <br/>
you what addresses they have listed.  I log in on my Yahoo address for <br/>
isntance, but there is a separate line where I list an alternate email <br/>
address to receive email.  You can see if there is more than one <br/>
listed.  I do suspect you are registered under the different email <br/>
address with LBNA though.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if this answers your question.  If not, I can see if I can <br/>
find out anything more.<br/>

&gt; I received an e-mail through the LBNA website from an unknown person, <br/>
telling me that my box was is good shape.  The problem is that it was <br/>
sent to an e-mail address that is not registered on LBNA.  It's an e-<br/>
mail address I use for personal e-mail.  The yahoo e-mail address is <br/>
used for my groups.  How is this possible?  Has this happened to anyone <br/>
else?  <br/>
