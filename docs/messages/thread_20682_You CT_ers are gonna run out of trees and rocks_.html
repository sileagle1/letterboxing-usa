Sheesh! My entire life I've had an aunt and uncle who live with my 4 <br/>
cousins in Madison, CT. I live up in Western Mass, and we would <br/>
drive down 5-6 times a year regularly to go visit. Now that I see a <br/>
gathering down in that area for next month, I figured I'd just run <br/>
through the boxes on letterboxing.org quick to see what was in that <br/>
area, figuring I might spend the weekend with them. After a quick <br/>
count, its safe to say that if I only drew a circle around their <br/>
town representing a 25 minute drive in any given direction, theres <br/>
probably ONLY 150 boxes in that area :) I was planning on going down <br/>
that day for the gathering, spending the night saturday and spending <br/>
some of the day sunday boxing, but after seeing that list, I may <br/>
just have to get friday off from work as well! I think I might go <br/>
crazy knowing all the boxes I wont be able to get in those few <br/>
days :) <br/>
