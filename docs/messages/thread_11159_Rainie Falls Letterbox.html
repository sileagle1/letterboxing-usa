for a new letterbos. My hiking partner says she's tried to post them twice - is 
she doing something wrong? I've sent the clues here in the body of this email, 
and also as an attachment - just in case. (I seem to remember that you don't 
like attachments?)</span></div>

<p>RAINIE FALLS LETTERBOX</p>
<p>MERLIN- GALICE, OREGON</p>
<p>Merlin-Galice, Oregon</p>
<p>Josephine County</p>
<p>Placed 1/10/03</p>
<p>By Tecihila and The Sherbet Cat</p>
<p>Trail Length  4 miles roundtrip</p>
<p>Trail Difficulty  Moderate (rocky and narrow in places, some 
elevation </p>
<p>changes)</p>
<p>Clue Difficulty  Piece of Cake</p>
<p>This is a beautiful hike along a fairly well maintained trail 
that follows </p>
<p>the Rogue River approximately 2 miles to Rainie Falls. The falls 
are not </p>
<p>marked as such but you should know when you reach them. Rainie 
Falls is a </p>
<p>spot in the river where the water thunders down about 10 feet, 
give or take </p>
<p>a few, over huge rocks with tremendous force and is definitely a 
sight to </p>
<p>see. During spawning season, you can watch the salmon jumping up 
over these </p>
<p>rocks on their way upstream so you might want to plan your hike 
for the </p>
<p>spring or fall run.</p>
<p>Directions to Trailhead:</p>
<p>Take Interstate 5 to the Merlin exit, #61, 3 miles north of 
Grants Pass. </p>
<p>Head west on Merlin-Galice Road through the town of Merlin. Stay 
on this </p>
<p>road and you will come to the Hellgate Canyon Bridge. You should 
stop and </p>
<p>check out the view if you have never seen it! Continue on and 
you will pass </p>
<p>Indian Mary Park on your right and eventually come to the Galice 
Resort. </p>
<p>Dont blink or you will miss it! Proceed another 7 miles to the 
Grave Creek </p>
<p>Bridge but dont cross it. Park your car along the road there. 
Walk across </p>
<p>the road to the trailhead and begin your quest. While you are 
hiking, take </p>
<p>some time to stop occasionally and absorb the beauty of the 
Rogue River. It </p>
<p>is definitely one of this areas treasures! Footnote: Directly 
across the </p>
<p>road from Indian Mary Park is the Umpqua Joe Trailhead. Check it 
out!</p>
<p>To Find the Letterbox:</p>
<p>When you reach Rainie Falls, on the upside of the trail is an 
"outhouse" of </p>
<p>sorts. Only go up there if you need to because that is not where 
the </p>
<p>letterbox is. Just a little further up the trail, 20-25 feet up 
the hill is </p>
<p>a tree with a root cave under it. Scramble up the hill and look 
in this </p>
<p>root cave. That is where you should find the letterbox. This is 
Judis </p>
<p>first carving so dont tell us the stamp sucks! We already 
know!</p>
