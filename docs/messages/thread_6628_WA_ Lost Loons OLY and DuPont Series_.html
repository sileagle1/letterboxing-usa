<br/>
GOT UM!<br/>
<br/>
I was correct on my route the first time I tried this. I was but a <br/>
novice and I was not aware of the craft in hiding the box on the <br/>
spot. After a marathon long weekend July 4th, I retackled the site <br/>
and got Thanksgiving but not Loon. It was thundering and pouring so <br/>
I really just reconfirmed in my mind what was NOT the right route.<br/>
<br/>
Today I went right to each spot E-Z as could be. Right where they <br/>
should be and really, which trailhead you choose is not REALLY going <br/>
to determine the outcome if you always take your first advantage when <br/>
working off the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Well crafted, if not spare clues. Do not overwork them or make them <br/>
more than they are. They are just what you need.<br/>
<br/>
However, neither of the birds on the stamps are Loons and if they are <br/>
the birds I think they are... <br/>
<br/>
BOY are they lost!<br/>
<br/>
The DuPont series are good too. Easy flat trail wide enough for <br/>
several people to walk together. Many good birds right now. I had <br/>
forgotten that we have native Oak trees this far north. The <br/>
distances listed on the clues sheet and on the trail signs do not <br/>
feel as far as they say they are. A good hike for everyone.<br/>
