Hey Funhog, rscarpen and all you other Portland area boxers, you'd <br/>
better give this one a try!  It's a hoot watching that movie lead you <br/>
to the cache, not to mention if studied closely, it could possibly <br/>
hone your city highway driving skills.<br/>
<br/>
We only hope the driver wasn't also the filmer at the time!<br/>

Claim this box quickly - it will be removed later this year for the <br/>
winter due to danger of loss due to winter/spring flooding in the <br/>
area (thanks to Mark and Beth for the tip). It will be replaced <br/>
after the danger is gone. Check the clue page for status as I will <br/>
note there when it is inactive.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think Ryan has found any of our boxes. Perhaps he's seen our <br/>
boring sig stamp and is afraid our box stamps aren't any good. :) In <br/>
any case, our box stamps are much better than our sig stamp. It's <br/>
probably about time to recarve our sig stamp, my skills have gotten <br/>
much better. Just carved a pretty cool hitchhiker that will be <br/>
released soon. It is my first stamp carved using something other <br/>
than an X-acto knife.<br/>

Actually, I think I might have gotten one or two of your boxes, but <br/>
I'm not sure.  It's hard to keep track of all these new people and <br/>
who placed which ones.  That and I haven't picked up too many <br/>
in the Portland area since getting back since most of my efforts <br/>
have been on the Seattle area boxes--generally those in Kings <br/>
County with a couple of expections since that's been my 'base of <br/>
operations' for the last couple of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which--there are some REALLY good ones out there <br/>
now.  The newer letterboxes are carving some amazing stamps <br/>
right out of the starting gate, and the older letterboxers have <br/>
improved dramaticly.<br/>
<br/>
I'm itching to the the Movie Mystery box, but I've needed access to <br/>
a computer that can play it!  =)<br/>
