What?!  Really?!  Should we start making clues in Braille?  Wait a <br/>
minute, there's already one clue I know if in Braille.  Hmm....  Very <br/>
interesting.  I bet night hiking is a cinch for you. ;o)<br/>

Just ask Jay Drew, or any of my letterboxing partners - Mary (RI), <br/>
Safari Dan, CSCM, Rustypuff - or boxers I know well in person, like <br/>
Trish Kurdziel or Moonstone Baby.<br/>
<br/>
I may walk into walls and be unable to read (I am able to contribute <br/>
to this board by using a screenreading program called JAWS for <br/>
Windows by Freedom Scientific), but I'm good on the trails!<br/>
<br/>
That why all the photographs of me, even indoors or after dark, have <br/>
me with sunglasses on!<br/>
