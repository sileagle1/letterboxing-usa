<br/>
I have wanted to place a letterbox in a historical cemetery for quite <br/>
some time.  However, I did not feel right leaving a letterbox in a <br/>
rock wall that pre-dates the Revolutionary War.  I threw the idea <br/>
around in my head for a while until I discovered 'Ecoscavenging'.  <br/>
Created by a fellow Letterboxer/Geocacher, the concept is to give <br/>
clues to a place ... rather than a box.  At this location you will <br/>
find the answer to a question of some sort.  By inserting the answer <br/>
into a web address, you will find an additional page with an image to <br/>
print out for your journal.  This idea is similar to some virtual <br/>
letterboxes.  For more information visit their web address: <br/>
http://www.ecoscavenger.com/  Up until now there were no Ecoscavenges <br/>
located in Connecticut.  I have decided to create the first.  You can <br/>
find the clues at the following web address.<br/>
<br/>
http://Letterboxer2002.tripod.com/Brookside.htm<br/>
<br/>
Please consider this a valid find for all of you who keep count.  The <br/>
work needed to find such a box is the same.  I hope you all enjoy <br/>
this type of letterbox as much as the ussual.<br/>
