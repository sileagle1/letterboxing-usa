You are in luck.  I too am carving-challenged.<br/>
<br/>
I use Simon's Stamps for commercial production of all of my<br/>
letterboxing stamps.  They aren't cheap, but the quality is excellent<br/>
and they are pretty fast (3-5 business days--could be faster but I<br/>
don't pay for faster shipping).  Our signature stamp (shown on our<br/>
AtlasQuest profile) was done by Simon's.  Folks always ask how I got<br/>
the lines so perfect......I cheated,that's how! If I didn't, my stamp<br/>
would resemble a banana slug (now I'm going to have the angry banana<br/>
slug fans after me!).<br/>
<br/>
Check out Simon's Stamps online.  Their entire ordering system is<br/>
online and pretty straightforward.  You will need a jpeg of your art at<br/>
300dpi. If you want help getting started on that, contact me offline<br/>
(renee@ciliated-cell.com).  Always happy to help a fellow wombat.  <br/>

A really great carver here in Ohio (franzsolo) encouraged me when I <br/>
first got started to just close my eyes and go ahead and carve.  Well, <br/>
not exactly like that.  But his thoughts were that anything carved was <br/>
appreciated by the finder because it is unique.  I too carved my first <br/>
stamps into erasers not knowing there was material that worked much <br/>
better.  It just takes practice and encouragement.  Please don't give up.<br/>
<br/>
One other tip franzsolo shared with me is to turn the medium you are <br/>
carving into rather than always trying to turn your carving tools.  And <br/>
those carving tools really do work much better than exacto <br/>
knives---although those do come in handy every now and then as well.  <br/>
Some type of magnifier--especially a lit one really helps a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Figuring out what clip art works better than others can help as well.  <br/>
Someone in your area who is a really good carver may be able to meet <br/>
with you and show you.<br/>
<br/>
The way you transfer your artwork to the rubber stamp material may be a <br/>
hinderance too.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing, you can also ask others to carve for you and share a <br/>
planted box!<br/>
<br/>
Try not to give up!!<br/>

While I fully appreciate that much of the joy of letterboxing lies in<br/>
the carving of the stamp, I have found that creating custom stamps is<br/>
equally rewarding.  Also, a custom stamp makes extensive lettering much<br/>
easier. So, my stamps are usually quite wordy and contain details that<br/>
will be used in later letterboxes....<br/>
<br/>
I think that's the best part of letterboxing--the "point" of the hobby<br/>
is different for different people.  Some folks love the hike (me!)<br/>
while others merely tolerate the walk to the destination.  Other folks<br/>
are all about the art, while some view each stamp simply as a "find". <br/>
To each his own.  Whatever facilitates your creative desire is just<br/>
fine.  <br/>
<br/>
That said, I have a bit of a financial incentive to learn to carve<br/>
since it would  be far more cost effective, but in the interim I am<br/>
just as proud of my custom stamps as any carver could be.  The art is<br/>
always witty and very specific to the letterbox theme.  I'm told by a<br/>
knowledgeable source that my stamps are similar in style to those found<br/>
in Dartmoor (many of which are also custom, commercially produced<br/>
stamps).  So, I'd like to think there is no "right" or "wrong".  We'll<br/>
all just play nice with one another and accept that some of us are<br/>
planters, some are not.  Some of us are carvers, some are not.  etc.<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
And with respect to your drawing capabilities, do not be shy about<br/>
accessing clipart libraries online.  Many of these are royalty free,<br/>
which means it is perfectly acceptable to use the images for a nominal<br/>
fee.  There are even some free sites, which although not extensive, can<br/>
sometimes do the trick.  My favorites are:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.clipart.com <br/>
<br/>
($17.95 for one week access--you can download as many images during<br/>
that time as you wish.  I usually wait until I've identified at least a<br/>
dozen images I want and then pay for a week so I can download them all<br/>
at once.  The cost is then about $1.50 per image, which doesn't seem<br/>
like much.)<br/>
<br/>
http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/25400/25410/writer_25410.htm<br/>
<br/>
(a free site I stumbled across some time ago--most of the images are<br/>
historical)<br/>
<br/>
And don't forget the good old microsoft word/publisher clipart.  While<br/>
not extensive, these collections can often get you started.  In fact,<br/>
our signature stamp includes a microsoft clipart.   From that, we<br/>
created our own design using basic microsoft publisher tools.  In a<br/>
pinch, you could use microsoft powerpoint to do the same thing.  <br/>
<br/>
Best of luck my wombat friend,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Winter time, and a young man's fancy turns to planting... At<br/>
&gt; least<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mine has.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a good idea. I have a good location. I have the artistic<br/>
&gt; skills<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of a palsied wombat. I tried, I really did. Bought 4 different<br/>
&gt; types<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of eraser, exacto knives, the works. Followed Doug's<br/>
&gt; recommendations.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But the stamps I wind up with aren't anything I'd put in a box,<br/>
&gt; unless<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it was one going six feet under.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm happy to go with a commercial service but I don't know which<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would be best. So I'm posting to see if folks have had positive<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; negative experiences with any companies or have recommendations.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for your help<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I love to carve in the winter. I love to study maps and plan routes and think up cool images. I love to find funky containers and plan cool ways to use them. But most of all, I like to keep my friendships going. Why not host a little mini gathering at a local pizza place or pub? Trust me..there are other boxers in your area with cabin fever too, who would probably enjoy getting together for some exchanging and brainstorming. <br/>
<br/>
Start a countdown til the first day of spring, and agree to get together for a muddy spring outing on that day! woo HOOOoooooOOOooo!!<br/>
