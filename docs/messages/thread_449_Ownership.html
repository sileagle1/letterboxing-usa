need to do these things?<br/>
Why have intellectual property?  Your names are generally not attached<br/>
to anything as it is?  If someone uses something without permission in<br/>
a way that you don't like you can take action against them.  Its<br/>
implicit that you have the right to do that.  You don't need a <br/>
statement about it.  We have all the evidence we need in case<br/>
something like that happens.  We will all stick up for you for sure.<br/>
The whole group is kept apprised of your clues and most of your the<br/>
stamps/stamp art.  If we need to we will stick up for one another.<br/>
I don't feel that people will be reusing material from<br/>
the web site unless they're looking for some letterboxing fun.<br/>
Does anybody mind waiting at least to see if their is an incident?<br/>
If their are no incidents its a non-issue, right?  I think this<br/>
would be similar to the vandalism issue.  When that happened some<br/>
people took actions against it - everything from curses to box<br/>
labels to not publishing the clues.  If art is stolen or reused<br/>
we could have a similar brainstorming session at that time and<br/>
come up with (again probably lots of) solutions.  What do you<br/>
think?<br/>

Ps.  Many people have a steak in this and have contributed<br/>
to it in one way or another.  Some of them are behind the scenes<br/>
and technical only.  I've not heard one of them concerned about<br/>
who might make use of or alter their work.  This does not<br/>
invalidate the concern people have over their art however.<br/>
It just shows that some of the value in what we have is<br/>
unseen and can never be (even if we wanted it to be)<br/>
compensated.  I'd like to say that I greatly appreciate all<br/>
of you, but esp. the little people behind the scenes, some<br/>
of whom get no recognition whatever.<br/>

<br/>
Basically, to keep the honest people honest Dan'l.  Probably 90% of<br/>
copyright infringement is by people who don't realize they are breaking<br/>
the law.<br/>
<br/>
If you have ever had it happen to you (and unfortunately, I have), you<br/>
don't mind taking a few precautions.  There is nothing wrong with<br/>
including a copyright statement on the site.  It doesn't change<br/>
anything... it is meant to protect the very thing we are trying to do. <br/>
It allows us to display our art &amp; clues in a very public manner without<br/>
worrying about who is seeing them &amp; what they are doing with them.  It<br/>
allows us to perpetuate the "innocence" and goodwill that we extend to<br/>
anyone who wants to get out and do some letterboxing.<br/>

<br/>
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  Why have<br/>
a disclaimer?  Why have anything?  Why wear a seat belt?  :-)<br/>
I prefer to be proactive rather than reactive.  So, the answer is,<br/>
yes, I mind.  Its silly to wait.<br/>
<br/>
As for the vandalism parallel, I regret not being proactive <br/>
about preventing it, as I am sure others are who have had their<br/>
hand-carved stamps stolen.  Now that we understand better how<br/>
to prevent it, of course we would have been proactive had someone<br/>
posted a proactive remedy to the list before the first box was<br/>
vandalized.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, while I'm here, and this was to be a separate post, I might as<br/>
well talk about vandalism with some good news for a change.  I<br/>
recently hunted a substantial number of boxes.  In every case,<br/>
I either found the box intact, or failed to come close to where<br/>
the clues indicated it was hiding, meaning that not a single box<br/>
showed evidence of vandalism.  It was a lot of boxes, and this is <br/>
good news.  There was a common thread, though, in that each of the<br/>
boxes required either a persistance to get the clues, get to the <br/>
hiding place, or to get to the general geographic location (lets <br/>
face it, the road to Mud Pond is not the easiest :-))<br/>
<br/>
So, the conclusion I naturally drew, whether wishful thinking or not,<br/>
is that vandals by nature may not be persistent people, so possibly<br/>
making persistance a requirement to find your box may mitigate <br/>
vandalism.  Persistance can be done in many ways, not just with difficult<br/>
clues.  A 5 mile hike with trivial clues may have the same effect,<br/>
provided the box is well concealed.<br/>
