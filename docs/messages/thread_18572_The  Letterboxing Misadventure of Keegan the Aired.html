<br/>
My trail handle is Keegan the Airedale Terrier - quite a mouthful, no? It's<br/>
taken from my one year old Airedale, Keegan. He's named after Manchester<br/>
City's soccer coach, Kevin Keegan.<br/>
<br/>
Keegan and I headed to Seatac, Washington. We were seeking the Flight Path<br/>
Letterbox series located in Des Moines Creek Park. It was a beautiful<br/>
spring day in the Pacific Northwest: blue skies, puffy white clouds, trees<br/>
and flowers in bloom and a gentle breeze to keep one cool.<br/>
<br/>
Before we started working on the clues for the boxes, I took Keegan down a<br/>
side trail where I could let him off the lease for a while. I ran ahead,<br/>
thinking he would follow. A bit further down the trail, I noticed no Keegan<br/>
in sight. I turned back and eventually found the Keegs. He was rolling in a<br/>
big pile of poop!<br/>
<br/>
I have owned several dogs down the years and so have had to handle this<br/>
doggy joy before. It was his first time rolling, and WILL NOT be his<br/>
last... Thankfully, we were right next to the creek and I was able to get<br/>
most of the poo off. But the smell, well you know. Windows down for the<br/>
ride home.<br/>
<br/>
It made for an interesting day of letterboxing. Fortunately, no on asked to<br/>
pet him. Good thing, eh?<br/>
<br/>
I was able to find 4 of the 6 boxes hidden by Amanda from Seattle. A quite<br/>
nice series located near Seatac airport. If anyone is flying into or out of<br/>
Seatac, and wants to letterbox nearby, here's a good series.<br/>
<br/>
Hope your day on the trail went better.<br/>
Keegan the Airedale Terrier, who's smelling much better after a bath!<br/>

<br/>
Does anyone else have a misadventure or two letterboxing they'd care to share?<br/>
