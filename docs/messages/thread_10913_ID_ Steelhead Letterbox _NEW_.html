Steelhead Letterbox <br/>
<br/>
Placed by J&amp;A-Bear on 17 February 2003 <br/>
Riggons, ID <br/>
Idaho County <br/>
<br/>
Directions: From state route 95 head west on Rapid<br/>
River Rd  (about 3 miles south of Riggons) following<br/>
the signs to the Rapid River Salmon Hatchery (open<br/>
from 8am-5pm).  Park there and then return to the<br/>
entrance and seek out the trail #113 you saw on the<br/>
right of the road going up the hill just before you<br/>
made the turn into the hatchery.<br/>
<br/>
Description: A good 4-mile hike round trip takes about<br/>
2-3 hours.  The path can be muddy.  You can hike for<br/>
miles back along the Rapid River.  Its really<br/>
beautiful.  If you hike in 3 miles you will be able to<br/>
see the Yew tree growing which marks the furthest east<br/>
it grows.  For more detailed information read about<br/>
this hike in Hiking Idaho, a Falcon Guide written by<br/>
Ralph Maughan and Jackie Johnson Maughan.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Start at the Rapid River Salmon Hatchery and<br/>
find Trailhead #113.  There you will start your roller<br/>
coaster ride on feet.  About a mile past a bridge<br/>
overlooking the clear water, rest on a tree at 240<br/>
degrees.  It is on the RIGHT of the trail and RIGHT on<br/>
the trail.  If you lean against it and look up, up, up<br/>
you will see a huge boulder staring down at you.  Hide<br/>
behind this tree and release the STEELHEAD trapped in<br/>
the stump.<br/>
