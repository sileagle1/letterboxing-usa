<br/>
I hope that this isn't considered bad form, but I know that all of you care<br/>
about our National Parks and would like to know if there was something that<br/>
you could do (especially if it was easy and didn't cost anything) to help.<br/>
There is a "grass roots" movement afoot (One For The Parks) to devert 1% of<br/>
the National Budget surplus to the Nattional Parks maintainence budgets.<br/>
I'm sure you all know that our National Park Budgets have been cut year<br/>
after year causing areas of every park (even the most popular parks) to be<br/>
closed and if we don't do something about it, we will be the first<br/>
generation to pass down the parks in worse shape than we received them.  OK<br/>
off the Soap box.<br/>
<br/>
To read more about the program go to www.theparksco.com, and click on Park<br/>
Support button at the top of the page and then follow through all the "One<br/>
For The Parks" buttones and you'll get to the proposal that has been<br/>
presented to sympethetic Senators and Congressmen.  From this site you will<br/>
see opportunities to go to the PhotoPoint.com site and send an e-postcard to<br/>
your representatives in favor of One For The Parks.  They make it very easy<br/>
to do and you do not have to sign-up for the site.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that you all take a few minutes to send your e-postcard,  AND forgive<br/>
me if this is bad form to use the list like this.  I'm hoping that because<br/>
we all cherish all our open spaces that this might be an OK topic.<br/>
