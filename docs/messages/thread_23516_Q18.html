If it is in Sherborn here is a town map:<br/>
<br/>
http://members.aol.com/sherbornma/SherbornMap.htm<br/>
<http: members.aol.com="" sherbornma="" sherbornmap.htm=""><br/>
<br/>
There is a RailRoad runing right through it (as opposed to the one in<br/>
the corner.)  Maybe East or West of the ____RailRoad?<br/>
<br/>
Or West or East of Route 16 (street names change).<br/>
<br/>
This mapquest shows Shirely MA shaded.<br/>

<br/>
Looks like Benjamin Rd/Phoenix St/ Shaker Rd bisect it N &amp; S.  So West<br/>
or East of this road sequence?<br/>
<br/>
And I don't see any Green Park Areas in Sherborn, but Shirley has<br/>
Fredonian Nature Center.<br/>
