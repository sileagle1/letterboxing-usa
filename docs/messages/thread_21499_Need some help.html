Hi ,<br/>
I went through the FAS page and i'm a little confused about what a <br/>
hitchiker is. Is it a box in a box and you take it with you. Also I <br/>
want to know how you carve a stamp,and does anyone sell them? <br/>

Hi Geogeorgia,<br/>
Well I guess you mean the FAQS page at LBNA. I'm glad you looked <br/>
there as it is a great help to new letterboxers. A hitch hiker is a <br/>
stamp, log, usually in it's own baggie, or small box that hitches a <br/>
ride with the box it is planted in and yes you do take it with you. <br/>
Carving a stamp can be fun even though it is very intimidating at <br/>
first. You can go to a local store like a Micheals or if you go to <br/>
the bottom of the FAQS page of information and find a supplier for <br/>
carving supplies that you can order on line. If this seems like too <br/>
much trouble for you to start off then you can use a store bought <br/>
stamp for your personal stamp and for any boxes you want to hide <br/>
yourself. Maybe someone else could jump in and give some advice.<br/>
<br/>
