<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Amanda, it was great to meet you on 
Saturday!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And I'm in Florida regularly throughout the year 
but NOT when it's sizzling out with wall-to-wall tourists, which means now 
through August anyway.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>But, next January I'll be staying in Orlando, and 
that means daytrips to Dunedin/Clearwater/St. Pete areas, and 
others!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Maybe we could plan an informal gathering in 
January, at one of the many fabulous public parks in that middle section of 
Florida so others could get there easily?  I'm thinking this would be a 
fabulous excuse for people to plan a winter holiday in sunny 
Florida!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'd be willing to coordinate, if this sounds like 
fun.  Of course, if there's already a gathering planned, let me know and 
I'll be there!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cheerfully,</div>
<div>Aisling</div></body></html>

Yo about Florida <br/>
O.K., we can do this. So many positive people getting together can arrive
in Florida like a bunch of letterboxing bugs and plant here and there. How
about some more Florida people putting their 2 cents in, after all -- it
is their state.!!<br/>
Lets get out the map of Florida and start planning. If we have a nice 'crew'
we can have more than one major city to meet in and plant. ST. Pete is good
for me too [lots of parks there] -- Orlando is a short few hours drive  and
can be easily done in a day --either way.  Hay, renting a Van and moving
around is a great way to cover a big area. Lots to talk about  and ideas
just pop up like spring flowers.<br/>
Just think how many letterboxes you young'ens will have found and planted
by the time you reach my ripe old age of ---well-- past 70.!!<br/>
Happy Butterfly Days,  Butterfly aka Nancy<br/>
