<br/>
All I can say is WOW!  Following the procedure that came with it transferred a perfect copy of the image from paper to carving medium!  And it didn't leave the toner buildup that I am used to when I use the Iron method.<br/>
<br/>
In my not so humble (grin) opinion, this method is as good as, if not slightly better than, the iron transfer method.<br/>
<br/>
Just as a side note, since there was so many negative comments about Xylene here earlier, The Chartpak Blender Pen is CERTIFIED NON-TOXIC, carrying an AP Nontoxic Seal on it and a statement that it conforms to ASTM D4236.  Here is an explanation from this http://www.wima.org/directory/InkCertProg.htm website of what that means:<br/>
<br/>
"The Writing Instrument Manufacturers Association established an Ink Certification Program effective January 1, 1990. The purpose of the program is to certify that participants' products are labeled in accordance with all state and federal laws pertaining to acute and chronic toxicity. Under the program, writing ink formulations are submitted to a WIMA retained toxicologist for review (subject to a confidentiality agreement). The toxicologist determines what labeling, if any, is required for the formulation.<br/>
The need for this type of certification arose as a result of state laws requiring schools purchase only items properly labeled in accordance with ASTM D4236. ASTM D4236 is a voluntary labeling standard developed through the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and essentially requires that specific warnings be given as to specific hazards. In 1988, Congress, responding to the public concern about this issue, enacted the Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act of 1988. Pub. L. No. 100-695. This new federal law adopted the ASTM D4236 standard and requires that the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issue chronic hazard guidelines to define the type of chronic concerns raised by state regulatory authorities. <br/>
<br/>
The State of California has also enacted additional legislation requiring warnings and labeling, the so-called Proposition 65 legislation. The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, California Health and Safety Code Section 25249.5 et seq. This legislation requires warnings on all chemicals listed by the State of California. At present, there are over 400 chemicals on the Proposition 65 list. The warnings required under Proposition 65 are similar to the warnings utilized in the ASTM system. WIMA incorporates into its program the requirements of new laws and regulations as they are enacted. Currently, WIMA is monitoring legislative activity in several states as well as the regulatory proceedings on chronic hazards before the CPSC."<br/>
<br/>
Now, of course, don't get me wrong. Xylene is a chemical and like any other chemical, it must be treated with respect and used in the proper manner. Here's some Tox info on Xylene:  http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts71.html<br/>
<br/>
The problem is this, I believe. No one is advocating that you dunk your head in a 5 gallon bucket of Xylene and attempt to hold your breath for 2 days. But some people seem to react that way, specially when something new is introduced to this list.  Yes Xylene is toxic. Yes it is harmful.  So is Salt in excess.  So's most anything in excess.  To much water and you drown, not enough and you die.  The Carving Nibs and Xacto knives we use can wound or maim someone if misused.<br/>
<br/>
There are a multitude of ways to get your image from the paper to the carving medium. Hand (Lead poisoning, Tennis Elbow, Squinty Eye Syndrome) tracing, Acetone (Also toxic - http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts21.html ) transfer, Rubbed (Lead poisoning, Tennis Elbow) transfer, Heat (Fire danger, Melted Carving Medium, 1st and 2nd Degree Burns and possible Polysteritsis) transfer and, yes, even the much maligned, toxic Blender Pens! (Sounds like the start of the Toxic Avenger movies! (LOL!!!))<br/>
<br/>
I say, use what works best for you, use it wisely, following all precautions. Research what you use, before you use it and, for the most part, everythign will be fine. There's always Murphy's Law though and even the best prepared with have an accident. So, like they taught me in the Navy, be preapred to deal with anything that happens.<br/>
<br/>
And be a bit more open to new ideas instead of blasting someone with both barrels when they mention something new.<br/>

I appreciate the fact that you took the time to check out the blender <br/>
pen/Xylene method of transfer. And I thankful for the heads-up to all <br/>
lboxers regarding keeping an open mind about "new and different" ways <br/>
of doing things. Thanks very much for the report and the amazing <br/>
information that xylene, in certain prefered forms, can be negligible <br/>
to our health. <br/>
<br/>
I hope your experience with a new transfer method was eye-opening, <br/>
worth your effort, and rewarding.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Mark<br/>
