                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went to Hopkinton State Park today to do a maintenance check on <br/>
Marathon (it's just fine) and to hunt for Danielle's 15th and the <br/>
Homer Series, since they were planted while I was in RI this summer.<br/>
<br/>
WARNING WILL ROBINSON!<br/>
<br/>
THE YELLOW JACKET HORNETS ARE OUT IN FULL FORCE.  PLEASE USE CAUTION <br/>
WHEN BOXING IN THIS PARK!<br/>
<br/>
I was on the trail looking for the "Pride Rock" box when I felt <br/>
something itching at my ear.  I had my nose pressed to the clue <br/>
sheet, and just randomly swatted.  I was standing still.  PERFECTLY <br/>
STILL.  Another annoying buzz.  I finally look up and I am *COVERED* <br/>
(and I do mean COVERED - the Park Ranger who found me running and <br/>
screaming down the trail into the parking lot can attest to this) <br/>
with yellow jacket hornets.  27 bites in all!<br/>
<br/>
I was giving myself this letterboxing tour as my own birthday present <br/>
to myself (next Sunday)!<br/>
<br/>
And to think - how am I going to tell Mary(RI)?  I am going to be her <br/>
bridesmaid this Saturday!<br/>
<br/>
I'm off to double dose on Benadryl, take a shot of whiskey, and sit <br/>
in an epsom salt cool bath for the rest of the day.  Doctor's <br/>
orders.  Really.  I love my doctor.<br/>
<br/>
I'll finish the series AFTER the wedding.<br/>
