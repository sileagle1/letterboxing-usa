<br/>
Sorry to open this up again - just found out you beat it to death <br/>
and researched it already. To bad we could not get that code and <br/>
adapt it. Hate recodeing stuff. Rather remove/change features than <br/>
code them from scratch. But I am sure you will make OUR VERSION even <br/>
better - all the ideas are there.  I know how hard it is to impement <br/>
one feature. Please everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Since I guess some people do not like the SIT REPS I bet You could <br/>
have the Member set a 'user preference' like view sit reps or not <br/>
view sit reps AND THEN the Box owner could set a 'Box preference' <br/>
like Sit Reps accepted or not..just trying to help !<br/>
