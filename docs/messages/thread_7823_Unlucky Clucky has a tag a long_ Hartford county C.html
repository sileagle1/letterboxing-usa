<br/>
This box was planted on Sept 19th  by RTRW and Cherieph on the way to find the Unlucky Clucky.  She was fine.<br/>
<br/>
 Holcomb Farm in Granby Ct is located at the intersection of Simsbury Rd and Day Street South.<br/>
As you are chasing Mr Fox on his hunt for the run away chick you will enter the flood plain forest.  This trail runs parallel to the ridge.  You will see 2 double -trunked hemlocks on the left with a downed, rotting tree between them.  At the foot of the ridge is a gathering of small boulders.   They seem to be deep in discussion. If you join this group at their northern end you may discover their secret.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on to see if Mr Fox ever does catch his chick.<br/>
<br/>
And-we got 'lost' on the way out.  Since we never want to return the way we came in (what fun is that?), we wandered in the woods for a time and came eventually to the road again.  Maybe the Chick can point you in the proper direction...
