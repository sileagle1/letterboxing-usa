Subject: No sleight of hand<br/>
<br/>
     The problem reading my messages involves no intentional sleight of hand<br/>
on my part.  There are not mysterious clues encrypted in whatever gibberish<br/>
you're seeing.  I prefer bandwidth hoggin' Rich Text, and it may be that<br/>
digest mode doesn't digest it well.  I've switched it off for this<br/>
message... if you can read this in the digest, then that solves it.<br/>
<br/>
     There is also no Sleight of Hand at the Smithsonian.  They don't have<br/>
it, or have a clue about it.  More than a little disappointing, but I got<br/>
some other big news from them that softened the blow.  I won't spill the<br/>
beans yet, but there's something big and exciting afoot... stay tuned!<br/>
<br/>
     So far as the box goes, we're not sure about a replacement.  Since<br/>
there's a good chance that merely replacing it would lead to a repeat of the<br/>
experiment, that seems unlikely.  It'll probably have to be something<br/>
boring, like the Davis, CA letterbox has become.  In any event, I'm about to<br/>
leave town for a week, then I'll get with them about a replacement, which<br/>
may well tie in with the other bit of information that I'm withholding.  Fun<br/>
things afoot!<br/>
<br/>
    Please mark the box missing until further notice.<br/>
