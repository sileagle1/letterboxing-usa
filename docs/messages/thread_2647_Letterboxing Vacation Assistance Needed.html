I'm looking for some assistance.  I am on vacation next week <br/>
(Finally!), and I am considering a letterboxing overnighter in what <br/>
seems to be the letterboxing haven of the U.S., that being Eastern <br/>
Connecticut.  What I am looking for are some suggestions for an <br/>
itinerary, as I am not at all familiar with the area.  If all works <br/>
out well I should arrive in the area around noon and would like to <br/>
spend the rest of the day boxing.  Then stay overnight somewhere <br/>
(suggestions welcome), and then spend the early part of the day <br/>
boxing yet again before departing for New Jersey.<br/>
<br/>
The box I definately want to go for is KJ's Best.<br/>
<br/>
All suggestions are welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Please email me at : SJinNJ@aol.com<br/>

&gt;Hello Wingfoot!<br/>
I can help you! First, I can direct you to some clues that are kept in our<br/>
letterboxing cluebooks in our Eastern Mounain Sports store in the Crystal<br/>
Mall in Waterford, CT. To get there you can look up a map to the store at<br/>
our website at http://www.ems.com Some of the clues in our books are not<br/>
posted on the internet. Including one that I just checked out for safety<br/>
called The Bridges of Pequot Woods which was placed by one of our customers.<br/>
It's a great box and a great walk and we have plenty of copies. Just ask one<br/>
of our associates where our cluebooks are and they'll help you out. Also<br/>
there are a number of hotels in the area. I also know of a great bed and<br/>
breakfast in Norwich on route 82 as well. We also have an abundance of<br/>
information in the store to help you find your way on local trails and to<br/>
certain points of interest as well. Really this isn't a sales pitch or<br/>
anything. All my staff are incredibly willing to help.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, Wingfoot! Oh, DO come to CT for the letterboxing! The area around <br/>
KJ's Best (Storrs/Mansfield Center) is just beautiful. You can easily <br/>
find cheap lodgings along US84 nearby: just use Yahoo or call your <br/>
favorite chain. Carol and crew (and many others) have been busy <br/>
there. There are lots of pretty boxes, and the hiking is perfect for <br/>
daytripping.<br/>
<br/>
And do come down to the coast as Eric and Keith (thanks for the <br/>
compliment!) have mentioned. The New England shore is fabulous. Right <br/>
next door RI is also home to a bunch of sweet letterboxes. There are <br/>
probably 200 letterboxes within an hour of the ice cream at KJ's.<br/>
<br/>
As Eric mentions, there are also "unpublished" letterbox clues at EMS <br/>
(and they really aren't hucking for business, but rather a real <br/>
resource that launched letterboxing in the area). My favorite of <br/>
those special letterboxes is "The Science of Letterboxing." Our next <br/>
series, half done so far, is one that that Eric graciously said we <br/>
post exclusively at EMS (hint, hint...).<br/>
<br/>
Drop us a note off-list (drewclan at aol.com) if you'd like, but I'm <br/>
sure lots of our local friends will be answering your post with their <br/>
favorites.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great time!!!<br/>

Having grown up in Eastern Ct,. and eating at Kj's<br/>
once a week for 8 weeks in the summer ... Boy Scout<br/>
Camp right down the road where I worked for about a<br/>
million years.. I would say, start with Lunch at KJ's<br/>
and then box in mansfield... when youre searching for<br/>
boxes in that area look for mansfield, storrs,<br/>
ashford, eastford... the exact itinerary is up to<br/>
you!... there are enough boxes up there to fill a<br/>
couple of afternoons... and strangely enough I havent<br/>
even headed up there yet...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good Boxing to you!<br/>
