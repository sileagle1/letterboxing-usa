Hi there<br/>
<br/>
You not only asked for help, you asked for opinions. Those opinions <br/>
can and did cover both negative and positive. If you are not ready to <br/>
accept critical comments then you should not ask for opinions. <br/>
Letterboxers are probably the most opinionated and passionate group I <br/>
have ever belonged to. That isn't necessarily a negative as if <br/>
questions are asked on any letterboxing chatlist you are assured to <br/>
get a variety of points of view.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First of all, I am not a gamer, I am a letterboxer, and just <br/>
because <br/>
&gt; I have something better to do on a Saturday instead of sitting in <br/>
&gt; front of my computer waiting for responses should not make me <br/>
&gt; suspect.<br/>
<br/>
(snippy comments back won't give you much cachet)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You didn't put much effort into giving much back ground, and since <br/>
you joined this group  on the same day you posted your message then <br/>
you aren't a known quantity. Thus no one knows if you are for real or <br/>
not. Most folks that join this or other chatlists usually write a <br/>
post similar to..."Hi my name is Joy, I'm a new boxer, blah, blah, <br/>
blah." Rather than that you came right out and advised what you were <br/>
going to do and wanted info on methods to use on your project. <br/>
Opinions were asked for and you received them. Questions were asked <br/>
of you and they were late in coming and not fully answered.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe I did not leave a lot of info, but I thought this was a <br/>
&gt; relatively simple idea, and was not expecting the inquisition.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Next, I volunteer for a 100-year-old community organization, which <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; trying to build a playground.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, but still you didn't furnish that info before, nor bothered to <br/>
mention the name of your organization even in this post.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I'm sorry that is not some monumental <br/>
&gt; earth/life saving cause, but it is an important one where I am.<br/>
<br/>
Play grounds for kids are monumental.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I never said that I would list or mention boxes not planted by us.  <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; just said that if someone where not satisfied with only finding 15 <br/>
&gt; then they could do others, which would have to be with clues found <br/>
by <br/>
&gt; their own means.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don't see why anyone would try to find other boxes not listed in <br/>
&gt; the rally during the rally because it's a race, also I don't see <br/>
&gt; people leaving boxes out in the open because they would help the <br/>
&gt; competition, and therefore I don't get that argument.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, as for letterboxing being a secret, it's not, at least here. <br/>
In <br/>
&gt; fact, two Saturdays ago, I went to a conference in which <br/>
letterboxing <br/>
&gt; was the topic.  It was geared for people who have never heard of it <br/>
&gt; and taught them the ropes.  Over 150 people were in that room and <br/>
&gt; they all took away that letterbox was for everyone, which it is, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; were chomping at the bit to go out and tell people.  So, to capture <br/>
&gt; the new excitement and offer an opportunity to current boxers, we <br/>
&gt; thought of this idea. And you know, someone told you. Maybe they <br/>
&gt; should not have to keep it a secret.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you don't like the idea of paying for clues, that's fine, and I <br/>
&gt; respect that.  Yes, I actually respect differing opinions. Novel, <br/>
&gt; isn't it? Obviously, if you don't like the idea, no one is forcing <br/>
&gt; you to do it. If absolutely no one agreed with this idea, then no <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; would come, and that would be the end of that. But many people do <br/>
&gt; things for a cause they believe in, that they wouldn't do otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I just paid $2 for a 2 spoonfuls of ice cream for my son's music <br/>
&gt; program at school. Would I have paid an ice cram vendor so much for <br/>
&gt; so little? No, but I did.  Would you normally want to pay for a <br/>
clue? <br/>
&gt; No, but we have many supporters who would.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lastly, I asked for help. Yes, I expected some to have negative <br/>
&gt; comments, but I also expected common courtesy. Instead of <br/>
&gt; saying, "Are you this?" and "Are you that?" in a nasty tone, you <br/>
&gt; could have said, "I think it would be better if you did that or <br/>
&gt; that."  My 6-year-old knows that.<br/>
<br/>
Nasty Tone?<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately there is absolutely no tone on my computer. Writing is <br/>
tone less. Readers of chatlists should be fully aware of this problem <br/>
in computer communication. I notice that you are willing to give <br/>
quite a bit of info in your complaint(the above) regarding the input <br/>
you received and reduced them to what your 6 year old would know. Why <br/>
not furnish more info regarding what you proposed and for whom and <br/>
leave out the comparison in which you attempt to reduce the imput you <br/>
receive to less than what a 6 year old would do. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 You folks are so quick to <br/>
&gt; criticize.<br/>
<br/>
Geeze, you asked for input, said you respected differing opinions, <br/>
now you criticize those differing opinions. Opinions can be critical!!<br/>
<br/>
 I bet most are only this way on the internet because I <br/>
&gt; doubt that you would have the nerve to speak like that had I asked <br/>
&gt; this in person.<br/>
<br/>
I have been pretty direct in life, so you would lose the bet.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I understand that everyone here loves letterboxing and wants to see <br/>
&gt; it continue in a pleasant and fun manner.<br/>
<br/>
Yep, many hate to see it commercialized, and many see your use in <br/>
using the name "Letterboxing" for your project as being a problem.<br/>
What you are proposing isn't "Letterboxing" at all. I do not think a <br/>
description is necessary if you are a letterboxer, but what you have <br/>
described doesn't seem to fit the hobby/game that most of us play.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a suggestion for your fund raiser and that would be to call <br/>
it a "Treasure Hunt". Plant some of your organizations tee shirts in <br/>
various locations and sell clues to those locations. You could even <br/>
make up some special shirts just for your event. Make the clues as <br/>
easy or as obscure and difficult as you like. Most folks would <br/>
understand "Treasure Hunt" and it wouldn't need any real description <br/>
of what the heck it was. Charge what you wish. I'm sure many finders <br/>
would be happier with a tee shirt than a stamp image.<br/>
<br/>
 But, holy cow, some of you <br/>
&gt; are like Gollum in Lord of the Rings. Go and keep your "precious."  <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; doubt I will respond to any further comments.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I appreciate the emails of support some have sent.<br/>
<br/>
You should appreciate the responses that "You" asked for and received.<br/>
Would you have felt better if your post was ignored? (not looking for <br/>
any repartee, so no response is necessary)<br/>
