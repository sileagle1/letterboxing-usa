Just to let you know...my Little Bird on a Branch letterbox in <br/>
Vernon, CT located on the Belding Path was destroyed and the stamp <br/>
stolen (or thrown in the pond I imagine)  I was so upset when I <br/>
found it with obscenities written all over it and the journal <br/>
totally soaked.  I was thinking about giving up this hobby but then <br/>
I went to find some Monster Mash letterboxes this past weekend and <br/>
met lots of nice fellow letterboxers.  And the boxes I found had <br/>
absolutely wonderful carved stamps.  Thank you all you Monster Mash <br/>
carvers or should I say creatures?! I am inspired once again!  I <br/>
just wish my little bird would fly home... <br/>

Oh please don't get discouraged.  The vandals will do more damage to <br/>
your enthusiasism than they could ever do to a box if you let them.  <br/>
There are thousands of wonderful letterboxers out there that are <br/>
waiting to come and search for your boxes, and will appreciate them <br/>
immensely.<br/>
<br/>
Try again, hide the box better, make it in an out of the way spot <br/>
that is less likely to be found accidently, and you will be rewarded <br/>
with lots of wonderful visitors.<br/>
