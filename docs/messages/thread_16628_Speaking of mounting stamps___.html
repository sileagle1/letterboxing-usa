Bay Bridge Landing letterbox has a wonderful small stamp which is mounted on<br/>

We have now found 10 letterboxes and I feel like it's really time for us to<br/>
plant one. I'd love to carve my own stamp and I have some ideas. So I just<br/>

I'd probably not get plumber's gasket for carving stamps unless you <br/>
have a very specialized purpose for it since--from what I've heard--<br/>
it doesn't carve or stamp as well as the "real" carving stuff.<br/>
<br/>
If you get the "white stuff", make sure it doesn't say Speedball on <br/>
it!  The stuff crumbles faster than Grey Davis's career.  Mastercarve <br/>
also has white stuff that tends to work pretty well, though.  The <br/>
pink stuff by Speedball is okay too, just their white stuff isn't.  <br/>

You have a great website.  I am VERY new to Letterboxing and the coolest<br/>
thing is that there are so many here in Ohio.  I'm in Springfield, Clark<br/>
County and I'm going to place my first box here soon.<br/>
<br/>
Not to advertise but for anyone in my area, if you come into my store and<br/>
mention the Letterboxing mailing list I'll give you a discount on<br/>
merchandise.  I have a small tactical/preparedness store and I sell military<br/>
surplus.  I also ship UPS &amp; USPS.  My website (still under construction) is<br/>
ww.preparednessnetwork.org/bearmountain<br/>
<br/>
I also run a national preparedness organization called NorthStar<br/>
Preparedness Network www preparednessnetwork.org/northstar<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great mailing list and information - this is great fun!<br/>

Dear Deborah:<br/>
<br/>
I, too, am new to the hobby and a cheapskate to boot. I started off <br/>
using a well-sharpened paring knife, believe it or not. That just <br/>
didn't work real well, so I've stepped up to a box cutter knife that <br/>
I already had at home. I've been happy with this, and I imagine <br/>
you'd get similar results from an x-acto knife. I imagine the x-acto <br/>
vs. speedball gouges is kind of like asking "which is better for <br/>
creating artwork--oil paints or pastels?" Each has different <br/>
strengths and weaknesses.<br/>
<br/>
I've also had good luck practicing on cheapy little novelty erasers <br/>
from the dollar store--10 for a buck, hard to beat that, and they <br/>
have pictures printed right on them that you can practice carving <br/>
away using various techniques. The material is thin (about 1/8 in) <br/>
so you need to mount them--I've been mounting mine on letter blocks <br/>
my kids no longer us, using super glue. Even if you use them just to <br/>
practice and want something more original to plant "in the wild," <br/>
your kids might find a use for them.<br/>

Im SO glad to hear from you! I too am relatively new to letterboxing and a<br/>
cheapskate! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Ive seen such beautiful stamps lately Ive been felling really guilty about<br/>
mine which are original, but rather simple.<br/>
<br/>
I also use an X-acto knife, and dollar tree erasers. Ive practiced up and<br/>
released several of my simple stamps, and have been feeling awful about<br/>
sending people to go find them, when they are so simple! I hadnt found many<br/>
boxes before and hadnt noticed the rather glaring differences. Now I think<br/>
Im about ready to move up to speedball and pink stuff.<br/>
<br/>
How have your erasers been turning out? Im curious to know if its the<br/>
material or the carver?!<br/>
