<div>With an influx of new people, I'm getting a little 
disturbed by some posts.  It seems everyone has forgotton a very important 
principle of letterboxing - Leave No Trace.  This means more than not 
throwing trash on the ground.  More importantly, you should leave no trace 
that you were there.  When people post that they did not find a box, they 
did an exhaustive search or turned over every rock.  This is just plain 
wrong.  An area should not be completely trampled because we couldn't find 
a box.  I know it can be frustrating, but turn around and try another box, 
or come back another day.  When I first started boxing, there was only one 
box in NJ, and for the life of me, I couldn't find it.  I came back again ( 
a few times :) ) and eventually got it.  But if you're confused, please 
maintain respect for the land.  Don't trample everything within a twenty 
foot radius of where you suspect the box was.  Also, for hiders, don't hide 
it under a rock in the middle of an immense rock field, it's only asking for 
someone to destroy it.  Just remember, it's a game/hobby/pasttime, and it's 
ok if you don't find every one that you hunt for.  </div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As someone living in a town surrounded by a beautiful National Park (Acadia)<br/>
I have to second these thoughts.  Our beautiful parks,  the very thing that<br/>
we all enjoy in letterboxing, are being destroyed a little bit every day by<br/>
the thousands of people who come to visit but do not respect them.  I don't<br/>
think letterboxers want to be included in that group.  I am a newbie, so I<br/>
hope that no one will be offended by my suggestion, but here it is.  For<br/>
those of you who are hiding boxes I would suggest that you make the hunt and<br/>
clues as challenging as possible during the hike to the location.  But once<br/>
someone is within a few yards of the box,  it would be better for the<br/>
environment if the box's hiding place were pretty easy to find at that<br/>
point.  I don't mean out in the open for everyone to find, but put it near<br/>
obvious landmarks with clues that make it very obvious when you see the<br/>
spot.  I find Legerdemaine's clues to be this way.  It has taken me ages to<br/>
figure out some of the clues when approaching the box,  but his final<br/>
riddles,  when you are standing in the right place, make a light bulb go<br/>
off.  I have also found that when I could not find a box and came home and<br/>
emailed the person who placed it,  they were most willing to tell me if I<br/>
had,  indeed,  been in the right area.  I would rather check in with the<br/>
box's owner and go back another day than damage the area by tramping around<br/>
where the box isn't.  Just my thoughts,  wanting to preserve our beautiful<br/>
outdoors as much as possible.<br/>

(P.S.  This note may have a bit to do with watching thousands of people<br/>
visiting our island who have NO respect for the park whatsoever!)<br/>
