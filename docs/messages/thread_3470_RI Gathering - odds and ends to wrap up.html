We just hope more folks will come to the area to find the rest of the hitchhikers we left at some of our newer boxes.  We are sorry about Kimball Arbutus #1 (The Little Birdhouse) having gone missing.  We replaced it late Sunday morning with the Trailing Arbutus stamp in a nearby - hopefully safer - spot.  (Please go to our web page for the update.)  That was supposed to be its original home anyway.  Meanwhile its recent hiding place (which didnt make much sense because there was no trailing arbutus there anyway) has been taken over by The Nurse Log (a much more appropriate stamp for that spot, an idea inspired by Colin).  Hope we havent created too much confusion here - it should all work out eventually plus just might give you a reason to come back to the area, to get the new stamp!Anyway it was wonderful seeing you all on Saturday, and well look forward to meeting even more of you in the Spring (blooming season), if not sooner.  Thanks again to everyone who helped make this gathering a success.Wanda and PeteP23F631X85<br/>
