                    <div class="plaintext-content">I received a report that both the architectural mystery box and the <br/>
cars-on-a-stick box are missing.  I'm not surprised at cars-on-a-<br/>
stick--I was being too clever by half in my choice of hiding spots--<br/>
but I'm sorry the architectural mystery box disappeared as well.  I <br/>
was also happy to hear, though, that the Oak Parker Hitch-hiker made <br/>
its escape before the abductions.  <br/>
   I will replace both boxes, in slightly different locations, but <br/>
probably not before next weekend.  I'll post the new clues here, of <br/>
course, when they're replaced.  <br/>
