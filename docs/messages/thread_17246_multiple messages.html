Mine posted successfully on the first try, but it posted twice.  I <br/>
didn't CC it or anything like that.  I posted directly from the list, not <br/>
from my own email.  I have no idea why it posted twice.  I'm sure I <br/>
sent it correctly.  I'm glad to hear that it wasn't just me having <br/>
problems.<br/>
