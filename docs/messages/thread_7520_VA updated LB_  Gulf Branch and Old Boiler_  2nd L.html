I have added a second letterbox.<br/>
<br/>

Gulf Branch is one of many creeks that form creek valleys draining <br/>
into the Potomac River.  Several are small parks.  Normally Gulf <br/>
Branch is a cool and pleasant tree shaded oasis on hot days.  With <br/>
the recent drought, we found the path dusty for the first time we <br/>
remember.  Still it's a shady pleasant walk along the creek ending in <br/>
views of the river, and more.  [When I replaced the stamp with a hand <br/>
made one rain had restored the lush atmosphere.]<br/>
<br/>
Through here passes the Potomac Heritage Trail.  A very long <br/>
riverside trail from Teddy Roosevelt Island all the way to the <br/>
beltway, I-495.  You can find a map of it at Teddy Roosevelt Island <br/>
(and a couple nice letterboxes there too) though you don't need the <br/>
map to find the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
In North Arlington, off Military Road find 36th Road near Gulf Branch <br/>
Nature Center.  Don't be fooled by 36th Street right next door.  Park <br/>
at the curb opposite Nelson Street.  Wood steps take you down to the <br/>
path.  Head towards the river.  You'll cross the creek a couple times <br/>
and go under the George Washington Parkway crossing very high <br/>
overhead.  In the second crossing, we discovered a teetering rock <br/>
slab that banged with a loud satisfying thwack echoing off the bridge <br/>
high above.  Stop where the water dives over the rocks and down <br/>
towards the river.  <br/>
<br/>
Here you could clamber over the rocks and climb down steep steps cut <br/>
in the rock.  But you don't have to to find the Gulf Branch <br/>
letterbox.  We were afraid it would wash away in a flood.  You go <br/>
up.  From the waterfall turn back the other way and very carefully <br/>
follow the Potomac Heritage Trail's blue blazes as they switchback up <br/>
the hill.  Stop before turning at the 4th switchback from the <br/>
waterfall.  There is no double blue blaze there indicating your U-<br/>
turn but there are 3 flat-topped rocks on your left to prevent <br/>
erosion of the switchback path.  Facing the river, with the 3 flat <br/>
rocks at your feet on the left, you are facing a tree.  At its base, <br/>
a smaller fallen tree angles up.  Look under a large flat rock under <br/>
leaves behind the tree.<br/>

Old Boiler<br/>
Established Sept. 2, 2002<br/>
Requires clambering over steep rocks<br/>
<br/>
Well I couldn't resist going back and planting another letterbox down <br/>
closer to the river.  I hope it doesn't wash away in heavy rains.  <br/>
After the Gulf Branch letterbox, head back to the waterfall.  You can <br/>
see a lot of drilled holes in the rocks.  They used to quarry rock <br/>
here for the capital's buildings.  Iron railings lead you down a <br/>
steep rough stair cut in the small cliff.  Notice the blue blazes of <br/>
the Potomac trail.<br/>
<br/>
Look for the old steam boiler in the water.  What is it?  Why is it <br/>
there?  Is it a beached locomotive?  Is it an abandoned quarry <br/>
engine?  Is it all that's left of a steamboat that burned when a <br/>
gambler carelessly flicked his cigar on to cotton bales?<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is precariously hidden where many people enjoying the <br/>
area can see you.  I recommend that you put down your backpack next <br/>
to the hiding place and look like you're doing something with it to <br/>
mask that you are accessing the letterbox.  You do carry a backpack <br/>
don't you?  <br/>
<br/>
Halfway between the bottom of the stairs and the boiler you will <br/>
notice the blue blazes painted on a rock ridge.  The ridge is halfway <br/>
between the waterfalls and the river.  Climb up the ridge looking for <br/>
a brown iron bar sticking a couple of feet straight up out of the <br/>
rock.  It is directly east of the boiler, 260 degrees. Next to the <br/>
bar are a rock ledge, some bushes and the customary flat-ish rock.  <br/>
Remember to try not to let people see what you're doing.   Please <br/>
replace the rocks very carefully to hide the box and toss some leaves <br/>
over it.<br/>
<br/>
