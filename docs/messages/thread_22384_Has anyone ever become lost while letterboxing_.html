For the most part, my GPSr has been a wonderful tool.<br/>

There is about a 10 to 20 foot margin of error when using a GPSr.  When <br/>
you get in close to the site and clues are measured in mere steps and <br/>
inches, it may not be much help.  If you are trying to find your <br/>
vehicle after roaming through the countryside for an hour or two, it is <br/>
invaluable.<br/>

Kidnapped" series. On a good day, the hike is 4.5 miles round trip and should <br/>
have taken about 3 hours including all 4 letterboxes in the series. Even though <br/>
it was raining lightly when I started up the trail at 4:00 pm, I saw this as <br/>
my only real opportunity to get these boxes as I would not be back in the area <br/>
for a long time. <br/>
<br/>
As I proceeded to the first box and then the second, the light rain turned to <br/>
a downpour and from the second to the third, turned into a deluge. Oh, well, <br/>
I thought, I'd brought my trusty umbrella so wasn't too worried. <br/>
<br/>
After retrieving all 4 boxes and getting thoroughly soaked despite the <br/>
umbrella, I headed out. Unfortunately, I failed to notice the fork in the trail on <br/>
the that I needed to take to get back to my car due to the splashing rain. <br/>
Consequently, I exited the park at the wrong trailhead and had no idea where I <br/>
was. It placed me in a residential neighborhood, in a town completely unfamiliar <br/>
to me.<br/>
<br/>
Being a veteran hiker and good engineer, I decided I would simply follow my <br/>
nose back to my car, heading off in the direction it should have been. <br/>
Unfortunately, the city streets would not cooperate and would not allow me to GO in <br/>
the direction of my car! By now, it's nearly dark, I'm wandering through a <br/>
residential neighborhood, soaking wet, thinking I'm going to have to call 911 and <br/>
confess to the local Police that I'm lost . . but hell hadn't frozen over so <br/>
that didn't happen.<br/>
<br/>
I decided my only hope was to continue on until I hit the main drag which I <br/>
supposed I would recognize. After another half hour, I found it but was still 2 <br/>
miles from my car! In all, this 'detour' added 2 hours and over 5 miles to my <br/>
trek. <br/>
<br/>
Hey, I was never really LOST, I just didn't know where I was!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the stamps were TOTALLY worth it!<br/>

A touch of paranoia. ;-)<br/>

Seriously, most of the boxes I've gone after have been on shorter <br/>
trails where getting truly lost isn't really an option (boxing with a <br/>
kid will do that), but I grew up hiking and doing backwoods camping <br/>
with my family, so I learned to remain just paranoid enough to check, <br/>
recheck, and, if necessary for my own peace of mind, triple-check that <br/>
I have the right trail if there is a fork or other such choice.<br/>
<br/>
And no, I have absolutely NO sense of direction, innate or otherwise. <br/>
I've never tried GPS, but maps rule for me, whether in the car or <br/>
boxing. I don't have amazing skills, but given a topo map and a <br/>
compass, I could probably get out of the woods before I starved. :-)<br/>

I also use trail maps, the clues and obvious landmarks to help me retrace or<br/>

that I need to head "North" or whatever to get back to my car.<br/>

When boxing in an unfamiliar area I always review  the clues closely, check<br/>
trail maps on line and/or email placers about trails so I have a general<br/>

different form Texas..<br/>

Those of you who never get lost while letterboxing,<br/>
what's your secret? How do you always get back to your<br/>
car or starting point?<br/>
<br/>
If you don't use a gps unit then do you always use<br/>
topo maps? Or do you have really good<br/>
compass/navigation skills. Do you have an innate sense<br/>
of direction? <br/>

good deal of time traipsing about in unfamiliar terrain), but I am a <br/>
big fan of maps.  I have noticed in my area (Cincinnati) that the parks <br/>
are often out of the maps that are supposed to be at the trailheads.  <br/>
Fortunately, I have discovered that the city and county parks have maps <br/>
posted on their internet sites, and I download a map before I go just <br/>
in case (just Google the park name).  I also carry maps of the parks I <br/>
frequent in my backpack.  On a related note, I never go letterboxing or <br/>
hiking without a compass, a whistle (three short blasts is a distress <br/>
signal, and a whistle carries MUCH farther than your voice), a small <br/>
first-aid kit, and a cell phone.  Call me paranoid, but I'd rather <br/>
carry extra stuff than not have it if/when I need it.<br/>

All that having been said, I'm rather fond of the philosophy behind the <br/>

<br/>
I'M NOT LOST, I AM EXPLORING<br/>
Written by JANA STANFIELD and JERRY KIMBROUGH<br/>
<br/>
IF I COULD LOOK DOWN ON THIS PATH I WALK<br/>
FROM SOMEWHERE WAY UP HIGH<br/>
I COULD SEE THE CROOKED ROAD THAT I HAVE COME<br/>
I WALKED A MILE WITH SORROW<br/>
I WALKED A MILE WITH JOY<br/>
AND NOW I'M LESS AFRAID OF EITHER ONE<br/>
FOR EVERY TEAR I'VE CRIED<br/>
THERE'S A SMILE THAT I HAVE EARNED<br/>
FOR EVERY MILE I WALK THERE'S A LESSON I LEARN<br/>
<br/>
CHORUS:<br/>
I'M NOT LOST, I AM EXPLORING<br/>
LIFE IS AN ADVENTURE WORTH ENJOYING<br/>
THOUGH I MAY NOT KNOW WHERE I'M GOING<br/>
I AM NOT LOST, I AM EXPLORING<br/>
I AM NOT LOST, I AM EXPLORING<br/>
<br/>
SOME PEOPLE TO CHOOSE TO LIVE THEIR LIVES<br/>
ON QUIET AVENUES<br/>
WHILE OTHERS FIND A PLACE IN THE PARADE<br/>
SOME LIKE ME ARE SEEKERS<br/>
WE TAKE LESS TRAVELED ROADS<br/>
BELIEVING WE CAN FIND A BETTER WAY<br/>
AND THOUGH I GET DISCOURAGED<br/>
I WON'T BE TURNING BACK<br/>
I HAVE JOY AS MY COMPASS AND FAITH AS MY MAP<br/>
<br/>
REPEAT CHORUS<br/>

ALL OF US ARE HEADED FOR THE SAME DESTINATION<br/>

  Ho, Ho! I'm glad my wife hasn't seen this one yet! We have somewhat <br/>
different definitions of the word "lost" If I haven't missed a meal, <br/>
and noone is ill, then I don't think we're lost yet, but she thinks <br/>
being lost is not knowing the name of the road we're on, or if, at <br/>
any time we change course due to a "slight" navigational error on my <br/>
part.<br/>
<br/>
  In my opinion, you're not lost until you don't know what to do <br/>
about it. Remaining cool and thinking logically and rationally will <br/>
be the best tool to take with you in to the woods.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think the easiest way is to follow two simple rules -- <br/>
<br/>
1.  Stay on the trails.  The letterboxes that are off-trail tend only<br/>
to be a few yards off the trail at most -- and usually within visual<br/>
distance of the trail, so yous shouldn't lose site of it.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Use trails maps whenever available.  Even state parks and<br/>
reservataions can get confusing if there are a lot of trails or you've<br/>
made a lot of turns and don't have a trail map to guide you back.<br/>
<br/>
Here in New England, most letterboxes are in parks and reservation<br/>
lands that aren't really that big to begin with -- even those that are<br/>
thousands of acres can be "escaped" from by simply continuing to walk.<br/>
 You might end up, like another letterboxer, exiting on the wrong<br/>
trail head, but in all likelihood you'll still be in civilization and<br/>
with options on how to relocate your car.<br/>
<br/>
This may not be true if hiking in what I call the "upper 3" --<br/>
Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.  Getting lost in the mountains or<br/>
woods of these states can certainly be perilous.  To the best of my<br/>
knowledge, letterboxes in these areas are faily sparce -- but when<br/>
hunting those that are there a solid rule to follow is to not hike<br/>
alone -- or, at a minimum, let someone know where you are going and<br/>
what time you expect to return.<br/>
