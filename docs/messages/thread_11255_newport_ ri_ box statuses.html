asked for better letterboxing weather.  Unfortunately, the last few <br/>
months of lolling around indoors severely reduced our stamina, so our <br/>
boxing finds were limited.<br/>
<br/>
Fort Adams was in place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
Fast Passage: Brenton Reef was in place, but the box was crushed and <br/>
the log was too saturated to even open, let along stamp in to.  So we <br/>
took it with us.  We'll attempt to dry the log out over the next <br/>
week, then replace it in its original location with a new box.<br/>
<br/>
Fast Passage: Castle Hill was in place and intact.  There was a <br/>
little water in the bottom of the box, but the log was dry inside its <br/>
plastic bag.<br/>
<br/>
Cliff Walk (placed by Kancamangusdabull) appears to be MIA.  This was <br/>
a very long walk with no pay-off (other than the magnificent views, <br/>
of course!), and by the time we were finished we were sore and <br/>
grumpy.  And we still had to retrace our steps to the car!  So be <br/>
warned if you plan to look for this box -- it is very likely gone.<br/>
<br/>
We stopped at Champlin's Seafood Market in Wickford on the way home, <br/>
and picked up fresh quahogs and cherrystones to make chowder and <br/>
stuffies for dinner.  Mmm-mmm!<br/>
