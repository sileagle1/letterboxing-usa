re-energized my letterboxing spirit.<br/>

<br/>
Already released one, got another one coming in the<br/>
next day or so. Guess I can come up with a few more.<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, according to the web site, and not counting<br/>
entries that are doubles, there are 104 listed boxes<br/>
in Western MA, and I happen to know that there are a<br/>
couple of unpublished ones, too. There are a bunch of<br/>
new boxers out here ::waving to Kstar, Paula, and<br/>
Dennis and Donna::, that are getting into the planting<br/>
game. It's been a great summer for us Massachusetts<br/>
people that don't live inside Rt. 128!<br/>

...who has to find the time to update our PFX count<br/>
with all of our new stamps from the DEP gathering...<br/>
