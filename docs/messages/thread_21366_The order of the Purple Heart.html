Owwww!<br/>
Hi, Went letterboxing with my two kids yesterday. We still have a<br/>
very little bit of snow here. Had my son in a carrier on my back and<br/>
a hold of my daughters hand. The trail was pretty dry, but there<br/>
were a few icy patches. I kept telling my daughter to hold tight to<br/>
my hand and be careful of the ice patches. Well, I was trying to<br/>
avoid them, but alas I stepped on a small one and went down. My left<br/>
leg went behind me and I landed kind of sideways. The bottom of the<br/>
pack held me up so that I didn't break my leg. Both kids are just<br/>
fine. I called my husband and he asked me if he needed to come and<br/>
get me (he was at work). I told him let me try to stand up. I was<br/>
able to get up and very carefully limp my way back to the car, about<br/>
a half mile away. Went to the ER and I avoided telling them about<br/>
letterboxing. Just explained I was hiking. I sprained my ankle and <br/>
am currently icing my ankle. Can I get this PLB?<br/>
<br/>

Just out of sheer curiosity, does PLB actually exist?  Has anyone <br/>
actually ever received it?  Who has it now?<br/>

I've seen lots of nominations for it, but have never heard mention of <br/>

You definitely should have received it after your bee<br/>
incident.  (wasn't that you?).  If it ever resurfaces<br/>
I'd love to add my stamp and incident to it.<br/>
<br/>
I drove 2 hours to find some Monster Mash boxes and<br/>
twisted my ankle 20 minutes into my first clue.  Well,<br/>
I certainly was not going home yet and hobbled through<br/>
the woods for 6 more hours before heading home.<br/>
<br/>
I could not walk for about a week afterwards, and my<br/>
foot swelled up three times it's size once I actually<br/>
took  off my hiking boots :)<br/>

&gt; You definitely should have received it after your bee<br/>

<br/>
I actually got nominated and AYED! twice.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Going out to confirm that a friend's letterbox really, really, <br/>
really, REALLY was missing (Pirates Past Noon, The Treasure, RI), I <br/>
stepped barefoot on a large buried oyster shell that was wedged in <br/>
the sand at a 90 degree angle to my foot.  It lodged into my foot so <br/>
deep that when I lifted my foot, the oyster shell was *still* stuck <br/>
into my foot!  After I yanked the shell out of my foot, I had to go <br/>
back along the rather long trail to my car - at which point I knew I <br/>
needed medical attention, and had to say to myself "what would <br/>
MacGyver do?".  I whipped out a bottle of Windex to wash and <br/>
disinfect my foot, then wrapped duct tape around it to keep it <br/>
covered.  Then I went after another letterbox in the same park.  It <br/>
healed just fine, but I do have a wicked scar.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Hunting down boxes in Hopkinton State Park, MA (Danielle's 15th), <br/>
yes, that was me, covered in yellow jackets, screaming and ripping <br/>
off my clothes.  Although I was welted up for some time, I only have <br/>
about 5 nasty scars from the 20+ stings I received.<br/>
<br/>
That's why I was wondering if the Order of the Purple Heart PLB was <br/>
an urban myth.  It never came my way either time.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If it ever resurfaces<br/>
&gt; I'd love to add my stamp and incident to it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I drove 2 hours to find some Monster Mash boxes and<br/>
&gt; twisted my ankle 20 minutes into my first clue.  Well,<br/>
&gt; I certainly was not going home yet and hobbled through<br/>
&gt; the woods for 6 more hours before heading home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I could not walk for about a week afterwards, and my<br/>
&gt; foot swelled up three times it's size once I actually<br/>
&gt; took  off my hiking boots :)<br/>
<br/>
OW !!<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess we need to put out an APB for this box, what do you say?<br/>

Hey Jude -<br/>
<br/>
I like the way you think!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we could get a really good carver <br/>
*cough*brianofteamgreendragon*cough to do the stamp and send it to <br/>
someone/s active and organized *cough*markandsue*cough to do the rest.<br/>
<br/>
I'd offer to carve, but my carving stinks **hackhack**, and I don't <br/>
have a website or regular access to a computer <br/>
**ahahahshootIwishIhadthemoney**.<br/>
<br/>
Ahem.<br/>
