series, adding names to the Honor Rolls and creating albums at <br/>
Picture Trail for those who were having difficulty with the jpgs <br/>
from the yahoogroup I'm using for the VLb series.  <br/>
<br/>
By special request these two virtual boxes (VLb#5 and VLb#6) are <br/>
aimed at the younger crowd ... but it doesn't mean they're off <br/>
limits to anyone else. (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Here is the link to find the yahoogroup I'm using to host the series:<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Letterboxing_Bindlestiff/<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BTW - to the person looking for Virtuals, besides doing a google <br/>
search, you can always search the message archives here on the LbNa <br/>
yahoogroup. I'll bet that would turn up some info for you, too.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
