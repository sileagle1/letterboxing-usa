This was quite challenge for me, too, but I really enjoyed it :)  It <br/>
was my first (and to date, my only!) letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
For those that have contacted me about the Thanatopsis letterbox in <br/>
Louisville:  My sincere appologies for not having replaced it yet.  <br/>
It was so disappointing.  I got one post card back from someone <br/>
saying they had found it; I went to check it out a few days later and <br/>
it was gone!  d'oh!<br/>
I plan to try to get over there in the next few days and replace it.  <br/>
It won't be the same stamp, but since only one person has found it, <br/>
that shouldn't screw anyone up too badly.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like there are a couple of new boxes in the Louisville area! <br/>
yay!<br/>
<br/>
Best to all and happy new year!<br/>
