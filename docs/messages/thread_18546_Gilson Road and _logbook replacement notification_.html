haven't yet gotten up to Nashua to replace the Gilson Road box. That being <br/>
said, I will make that my #1 priority today after teaching my three <br/>
Saturday morning students. My apologies if anyone has gone looking for it! <br/>
I might go put a little card near the end of the NH Ghosts box logbook as <br/>
well that says "If you have stamped in on this page, please email me and <br/>
let me know that it's time for me to come replace the logbook." or <br/>
something. What do you all think of that? I think that, for any boxes I <br/>
place, I might do that as well.<br/>
