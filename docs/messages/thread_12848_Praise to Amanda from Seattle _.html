                    <div class="plaintext-content">This past mothers day week-end we had two days of family letterboxing...two from Anchorage, four from Montana and our daughter, her 5 yr old and her nine mo old from the Issaquah area.  Friday we found Amanda`s Flaming Guyser box.  We went one a long wild goose chase for a non Amanda box.  Saturday we went on a great hike and found Amandas two Holloween letterboxes.  We let the five yr old look behind the trees and under the rocks for the boxes.  Now he and his mom are hooked.  They are lucky as the are zillions of boxes to be found in the Seattle area.  Here in Montana boxes almost do not exist, although we are trying to change that.  Finding is more fun than planting!  So, our hats off to Amanda who made the hunt sucessfull.
