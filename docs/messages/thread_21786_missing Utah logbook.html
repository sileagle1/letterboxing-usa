Nadine and I went to check on our Glassman Pond letterbox (Weber <br/>
County, UT) today and found the logbook missing (the stamp remains). <br/>
The box and stamp were were well hidden by the last person to find it, <br/>
so we're hoping it was just <br/>
mistakenly put into a stamper's bag by accident. If you have it, just <br/>
put it back in its hole in a strong plastic bag (we have the box at <br/>
home right now). Or send us an email at frankandnadine@hotmail.com.<br/>
<br/>
Has this happened to anyone else?<br/>
