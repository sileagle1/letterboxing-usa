This is my first placed letterbox, so please let me know if I have <br/>
forgotten something. Also, the directions are a bit spotty because <br/>
I'm horrible with them! :) The reservation is located on Salem St in <br/>
Andover, MA<br/>
The Skug River Letterbox was placed at the Skug River Reservation on <br/>
5/2/03 by FleurChild and Eric. This land is part of a series of <br/>
protected areas in Andover refered to as AVIS land. Please see this <br/>
page: http://www.avisandover.org for more information<br/>
<br/>
Story behind the box: Located nearby is one of the Jenkins house, <br/>
which was used as a stop on the Underground Railroad.  From the <br/>
South, either by boat or through other towns, runaway slaves would <br/>
spend a night or so in the secret room in the attic of the Jenkins <br/>
house. From this location, they would travel north to Salem, NH and <br/>
other towns.  <br/>
