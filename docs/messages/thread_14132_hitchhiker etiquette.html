                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not sure that there is one "right" answer to your question.  I <br/>
have found that it is not done consistently, so as with most <br/>
everything else about letterboxing, you do what feels right for you...<br/>
<br/>
I'm surprised the HH was not already stamped into the host box when <br/>
you found it.  I generally stamp a HH into the box I am placing it <br/>
in, and stamp the permanent box stamp into the HH log.  This way both <br/>
the box log and the HH log have a record of where the HH was.  I also <br/>
stamp the HH into my personal log book and stamp my personal stamp <br/>
into the HH log.  I then make a note in the HH log of where and when <br/>
I found it, and where and when I left it.<br/>
<br/>
It can be a lot of stamping and a bit confusing as to who/what gets <br/>
stamped where, and it is easy to forget to stamp it into a box when <br/>
you leave it, so I usually check to make sure it was stamped in <br/>
before I take off with it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Generally, you want a record of where the HH has been and who has <br/>
transported it. So YES, the host boxes should be stamped in and also <br/>
the signature stamps of the folks who carry the HH from place to <br/>
place.   It is nice also to stamp the HH into the host box, because <br/>
this way folks who visit the box can see an example of the stamp art <br/>
and know that the HH visited the box. <br/>
<br/>
There is alot of stamping going on! When I find a HH, I generally <br/>
will make sure that it is already stamped into the host box and the <br/>
host box stamp is in the HH log. Then I just throw the HH in my bag <br/>
and deal with signing in with my signature stamp later...in the car <br/>
or at home. <br/>
