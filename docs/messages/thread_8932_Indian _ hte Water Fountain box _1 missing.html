a few people, so we went out to check it today and it is indeed <br/>
awol.  We will replace it as soon as possible and post when we do.  <br/>
We will also probably change the location.  Just a little too public, <br/>
we think.  The other 3 boxes are still there, so we'll let you know <br/>
when we get this one out.<br/>
