<br/>
Got a question, not about letterboxing really.  But, I was originally <br/>
attracted to letterboxing because its a fun way to get me moving and enjoying <br/>
the nature around me.  Besides letterboxing, I've found a couple other <br/>
interesting walking activities and I was wondering whether anyone else has <br/>
some too that they'd like to share.  I'd like to broaden my walking horizons. <br/>
 Besides it helps me think of new stamps to carve and new box locations!<br/>
<br/>
Volksmarching sounds like fun.  I'm going to try my first 10K walk next <br/>
weekend.  They have clubs all around the country and you don't have to be a <br/>
member to do a walk. <br/>

Mazes are meant to get lost in.  Labyrinths have only one path that lead to <br/>
the center and they are meant to get found in.  Lots of history and mystery <br/>
in labyrinths.  Walking meditation.  I took a lecture on them and then walked <br/>
around in a local one.  Interesting.  It you go to the site's links and then <br/>
to The Labyrinth Locator you should be able to find labyrinths in your area. <br/>
Both indoor and outdoor.<br/>

This site is for a local Race For The Cure marathon.  I'm doing the 5K Walk.  <br/>
Surely there are more event walks like this out there.  I wonder if there is <br/>
a site linking them all??<br/>

Who has more ideas out there??<br/>
