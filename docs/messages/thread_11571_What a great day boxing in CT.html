quite a while!  The three boxes in the Bear Hill Series had not been visited <br/>
since 4/20/02!!!!  It was nice to see all three in good shape, with the <br/>
exception of the third, which had a totally icky stamp pad.  We then went <br/>
over to "Hills, Rocks, and Trees oh My!" and found all three there (and NO, I <br/>
did not get any help from Lobsta or Butterfly, even though they had already <br/>
been there).   I also visited the Perk on Main letterbox, and found it <br/>
without clues (and NO, I didn't ask for any help there either!).  Not bad, <br/>
considering that I didn't get boxing until 12:00 p.m. due to having to take <br/>
my car into the Auto Body shop, and get a rental for the entire week!  <br/>
<br/>
My one word of advice, try not to get your parked car hit by a school bus.....<br/>

there, but we arrived around 11/11:30.  Wasn't it a great day for<br/>

How is this for an idea ?? When I have to pull theRock Neck 'Birds' from <br/>
the camping circles,  in a week or so,  do you think they could 'fly ' <br/>
north west and land somewhere in that lovely park for the summer ? That <br/>
way all the folks from up in that area that never were able to make it <br/>
south to Rocky Neck, would be able to enjoy the series ?? What say you?? <br/>
 The R.N.S.P. and the Crane boxes would not travel with them, of course, <br/>
so that would be five boxes.<br/>
