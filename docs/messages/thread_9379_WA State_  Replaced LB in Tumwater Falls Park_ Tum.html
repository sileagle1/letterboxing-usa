Tumwater Falls Park<br/>
Tumwater<br/>
Thurston County<br/>
Washington<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Take I-5 to Exit 103 in Olympia, and turn towards the <br/>
Miller Brewery.  Just before passing the brewery building, turn down <br/>
the small road that leads downhill, and crosses the canyon again.  <br/>
After crossing the canyon, turn left and drive to the park <br/>
entrance.  Park near the bathrooms.   <br/>
<br/>
Time: Allow 30 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Distance: approximately 1 mile loop.<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Easy walksome gravel, some pavement, some short slopes, <br/>
slight stone-stepping across small creeks involved.  Clues easy.<br/>
<br/>
Setting: Tumwater Falls Park.  A neat natural vacation amidst a <br/>
bustling cityscape! <br/>
<br/>
Highlights: A paved trail begins past the bathrooms and passes the <br/>
half artificial Upper Tumwater Falls and proceeds down either side <br/>
of the river, passing several small waterfalls on the brewery side <br/>
of the river, and Middle Tumwater Falls along the river.  The trails <br/>
converge above Tumwater Falls, and a flight of stairs leads to a <br/>
concrete viewing platform (often enshrouded with mist) in front of <br/>
the thunderous falls .25 mile from the trailhead.  <br/>
<br/>
Facilities: Amenities include a restroom located at the parking lot. <br/>
Bring a picnic lunch and enjoy it after you find the letterbox.  <br/>
There is a picnic area and a small playground, too! <br/>
<br/>
Restrictions: Pets are allowed.<br/>

November 2002.<br/>

Clues:  At the end of the ship's plank, is where you begin, head <br/>
toward the big (fenced) tank, the Chinook are kept in (seasonal).  <br/>
Walk around toward the falls, oh my, what a thrill!  Look for the <br/>
totem pole and the petroglyph near the building before you head down <br/>
the hill.  Render your respects to Old Glory, and continue on down, <br/>
to a marker that celebrates the 1st American colony settlers in <br/>
town.  Continue to the `arc-ed' bridge, which you'll cross when you <br/>
may, follow along the trail, toward the very distant Budd Bay.  Neat <br/>
little path, cross stepping stones you must, if the little box is a <br/>
goal, in me you need trust.  ** Head down to the trestle bridge, and <br/>
cross with great care, turn right to the steps and continue down if <br/>
you dare.  Look at the quiet lake, roaring falls and make a wish for <br/>
good luck.  Before you head up, take a look under the stairs, within <br/>
an old, crooked tree stump high atop toward the right &amp; rear.  Find <br/>
the little box (35 mm film canister), don't forget ink &amp; stamp pad, <br/>
stamp in and say hi.  Be careful to rehide it (VERY WELL I beg you--<br/>
this is a popular area for kids) when you're set to say good-bye! <br/>
Head back up the stairs and take the trail back toward the park.  <br/>
Over a boardwalk bridge ever so lightly do tread, for don't worry, <br/>
dear friend, your quest (vehicle) is just ahead.  Look for the `tree <br/>
stump seat', and, oh, if you're tired take a rest, but know, dear <br/>
friend, that you have almost passed this little test.  For only a <br/>
few steps more, will return you to the start, to other far off <br/>
adventures or wherever desires your heart. <br/>
<br/>
**If you do your homework, you might be able to solve a mystery <br/>
around these parts, too.<br/>
