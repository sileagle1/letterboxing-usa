crazy here.  Cheryl of Teammaddawg  - Cinncinatti Ohio is here in Ct. <br/>
for a boxing weekend Lets all gather to give her a frenzy of <br/>
exchanges. I have tried three different buildings for a after dark <br/>
gather to no avail and it is a bit "brisk" out there but nothing like <br/>
the cold of last winters  gathers so I propose we meet up Sunday <br/>
between 4-6 at Eagleville Dam  Rte 275 in  Mansfield. Eagleville <br/>
preserve is there and there are a few boxes . I will see that Sit and <br/>
Relax is replaced for this event as I have been meaning to.  I will <br/>
bring an event stamp and have a HH for you to stamp before it moves <br/>
on.  There will be a couple of  special boxes and we can all have <br/>
fun. <br/>
    To get to Eagleville Dam take  rte 32 to the junction of rte 275. <br/>
Turn there near the stone church toward Coventry. Go slow around the <br/>
sharp bend  ansd under the train tracks parking on the right next to <br/>
the river and  Preserve on the  opposite side of the road.   We will <br/>
have only and hour pof light but we can enjoy exchanges  even as the <br/>
light fades. If you have a camp lantern bring it along!  Hope to see <br/>
a few of you there.   Carol - Leader of the Pack<br/>

I'm a newbie (since September) to letterboxing. Myself and my family <br/>

This will be our first letterboxing event and we're excited!<br/>

<br/>
I'm suffering withdrawal symptoms.  I haven't even walked around the neighborhood during my lunch break.:::bleah:::  I need to get out and box.  I was looking forward to a spur-of-the-moment get together.  It's only a little more than an hour away.  Guess we'll stay home and do little things around the house.  <br/>
<br/>
That area of CT has so many boxes!!!!!!!!  Even if there are only a few right there near the dam, there are many all over the county and the weather is so clear and crisp!  Hope you have a great time.  Sorry we couldn't meet Cheryl and touch base with you, too, Carol.<br/>
