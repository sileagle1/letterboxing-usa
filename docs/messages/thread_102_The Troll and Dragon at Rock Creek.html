Rock Creek series!!!<br/>
<br/>
I have finished my clues for The Rock Creek Dragon Letterbox and The Rock<br/>
Creek Troll Letterbox.  Like all the others in this series, these letterboxes<br/>
are ideal for family outings with younger children.<br/>
<br/>
As promised, these letterboxes must be located using a rubber stamped map<br/>
which I created specifically with kids in mind.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if only the torrential downpour will give us a break, the Cheney family<br/>
can look for these two while I go searching for Rock Creek #2.<br/>

Ha!  Great minds think alike!  I was considering a troll stamp for the<br/>
bridge area (especially with the 3 "billy goats" that live up the<br/>
hill).  I think the weatherman suggested things might clear this<br/>
afternoon and both the boy and the beagle need some air... looks like<br/>
the hunt is on!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well.... we are one for two.  Brian and his friend Eli (who was ECSTATIC<br/>
about being included) and I drove over to the park with about 1 hour of<br/>
light left.  We searched high &amp; mostly low for the Rock Creek dragon<br/>
box.  Unfortunately my printer cut off some of the clues from the<br/>
page.... not to be discouraged by that, we concentrated on the clues we<br/>
had... and BINGO!  We barely found it!!  Mitch got tricky with this<br/>
one... he used a standard Rubbermaid sandwich keeper, but then he<br/>
camoflauged it.  A very neccesary thing in this heavily used park.  In<br/>
the fading light it was hard to see in the dark woods.  The boys stamped<br/>
their books (in all the excitement, I forgot to stamp mine!!) and<br/>
admired the dragon who guards the letterbox.  Mitch carved this stamp<br/>
from 2 Pink Pearl erasers.  They are mounted on a block of wood.  It is<br/>
quite a large stamp &amp; very well done.<br/>
<br/>
We had a good idea where the troll box is hidden, in fact from one<br/>
vantage point you can see all 4 bridges on Mitch's map (not a very big<br/>
area). However, Rock Creek is so high that bridge #2, a small<br/>
footbridge, is mostly underwater.  I hope the Troll is hidden high!! <br/>
The boys suggested that we go home and get the canoe and return.  A good<br/>
idea, but with about 15 minutes of light left, not practical.  Instead<br/>
we drove around to where we think the trail comes out.  We ended up in<br/>
Epson's parking lot... apparently on the wrong side of the stream.  We<br/>
will wait for the creek to subside before claiming victory and<br/>
vanquishing the Rock Creek Troll.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a good search with a great stamp Mitch!!   <br/>
