O.K. so Mom BeMa was really bummed after our miss at the dog park and Dad <br/>
BeMa knew that when Mom is bummed....  So, off we went to try for another <br/>
letterbox.  Need to end on a good note!  Headed back toward home and decided <br/>
to try for one of the boxes we hadn't searched for at Riverbend.  We found <br/>
the dirt path and headed down along the river.  Pup made it to the box in <br/>
about 8 minutes (draggin Mom behind), Dad (limping again) trailing the <br/>
little ones, clocked in at closer to 20.  We love the little hiding place <br/>
for this box (just where it's supposed to be and above ground! -- no more <br/>
poking and digging around with the snakes and spiders -- although, now that <br/>
I think of it, something could have been in the hole too....)  This box has <br/>
been well loved!  There are a ton of stamps and it has been the home to (we <br/>
counted) 4 hitchhikers.  Unfortunately, none this time.  It's been through <br/>
an animal gnawed stamp, a replacement stamp.  Well, if that's not a lesson <br/>
in perseverance!  Mom BeMa is trying to take note and not dwell on the ones <br/>
we couldn't find.  Going back along the path, pup slowed a little and we <br/>
were able to admire the beautiful river.  Couldn't slow down too much 'cause <br/>
the littlest BeMa must have been drinking water in the car...  Nice <br/>
restrooms and just in the nick of time!  All and all, a great ending to a <br/>
nice day outdoors!<br/>
<br/>
I can't believe we would have to ask for hints on a sixth failed to locate <br/>
box.  It always seems we do it all right (all the time -- not just in <br/>
boxing.....).  But, here goes, is the last big tree really close to the <br/>
start of the path to the left?  The big tree further down was part of a ring <br/>
of trees and we thought if it was that one, it would be noted as such.  <br/>
Could the leaves have covered the little fallen tree?  Did the letterboxers <br/>
we met hide it too well?  Should I stop obsessing and go back to eating more <br/>
leftovers?  I think so!  There is always tomorrow and now that great box in <br/>
the Smithsonian (and I'm sure the info desk is close by)...<br/>
<br/>
BeMa<br/>
P3 F20 X (still none!  I don't think the boxers we met knew about exchanges, <br/>
they said they were very new [then how come they found the box we <br/>
didn't?]....) and 6 attempts (but we'll get them some day!)<br/>

Riverbend box, or the dog park? It's important?<br/>
