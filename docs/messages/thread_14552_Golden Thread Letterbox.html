<br/>
Donna and I were cruising around the Branford area yesterday and <br/>
decided to grab a quick box. We found the Golden Thread letterbox at <br/>
the Branford Hall Career Institute. Unfortunately, the box was in <br/>
some serious need of TLC. The box was filled with water and the <br/>
logbook was soaked. We went Walmart, down the road, to pick up some <br/>
baggies and a new logbook. The box has been restored. <br/>
<br/>
This box has been classified as abandoned on the new site.  We <br/>
checked the old site and could not find an owner. If you happen to <br/>
know who placed this box, please contact off list (we do not read the <br/>
messages daily) and we will forward the logbook as soon as it dries <br/>
out. If no one claims this box, we would be more than happy to adopt <br/>
it. It seemed like such a popular box, it would be a shame to let it <br/>
go.<br/>
