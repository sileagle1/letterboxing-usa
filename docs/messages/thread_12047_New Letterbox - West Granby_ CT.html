Clem's Adventure<br/>
<br/>
Planted on 4/17/03 by the first Connections program middle school <br/>
participants at Holcomb Farm:<br/>
Bugman, Guinea Pig Lover, Vixen Trainer, Forest Nimph, Treeclimber (I <br/>
had a lot of fun working with all of you! Hope to see you out <br/>
letterboxing!  - Tree Fairy)<br/>
Difficulty: Easy<br/>
Time: 1 hour<br/>
Contact:  Tree Fairy (mvmorningstar@yahoo.com)<br/>
<br/>
Holcomb Farm is open to the public from dawn to dusk.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Holcomb Farm: From the center of Granby, take Route 20 <br/>
West approximately 2.5 miles to Day Street South on the left. Follow <br/>
Day Street South a short distance to the end. You can't miss the big <br/>
red barns directly in front of you that mark Holcomb Farm. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
On a cloudy spring day Clem the snake was prowling the Farm and <br/>
looking for something to eat.  Then he decided to take the risk of <br/>
crossing Simsbury Road and slithering under the gate.  He started up <br/>
the hill, avoiding the puddles and electric fence.  At the top of the <br/>
hill Clem almost got trampled by a horse! He quickly took a left and <br/>
then his first right into the woods.  Clem noticed that he was <br/>
surrounded by many evergreen trees.  He thought about stopping in the <br/>
rock wall on the right, but he kept going.  He came to a USGS box <br/>
marking a well, so he went under the box to take a drink.  But Clem <br/>
was still hungry so he continued right down the trail, trying to <br/>
forget the pain of hunger.  He was tempted again to stop at a rock <br/>
wall, this time on the left, but instead slithered in and out of <br/>
puddles of mud until he came to the end of the rock wall, where the <br/>
forest meets the field.  Here Clem continued left and followed along <br/>
the outskirts of the forest until he got to another gate.  Clem <br/>
slithered under the gate (although you don't have to).  By this time, <br/>
he was a very tired snake.  He followed the easy Laurel Loop trail <br/>
where there was a lot of mud and water.  He followed the trail to the <br/>
right at the bend and came to a rock cairn (add a rock if you'd <br/>
like).  Clem continued down the hill through a few downed trees.  <br/>
Then, by some great luck, Clem saw a wood frogand just like that, <br/>
gained strength!  Clem was last seen in the middle of a three-trunked <br/>
white pine tree on the left of the trail.  <br/>
