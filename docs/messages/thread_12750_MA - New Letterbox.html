 We added a 3rd box, "Star Flower" to our group at Rocky Woods. Now <br/>
when you follow the clues you'll be led in a loop from the parking <br/>
lot, to each of the boxes, and then back to the parking lot.<br/>
  I don't think this will show on the Announce List as the only edit <br/>
required was to change the number of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
   If you like to be the first finder - 2 of these boxes have not yet <br/>
been found! I did check on the older 2 boxes today and they were fine.<br/>
<br/>
   Also, I added detail to the clues for the first box, Mourning Dove.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
