                    <div class="plaintext-content">After my long absense in Central America, I returned to California <br/>
with an urge to start hunting down letterboxes--being as rare as <br/>
the snowy plover in Central America.<br/>
<br/>
Since I actually consider Oregon to be my home, though, I <br/>
naturally had to drive up and hunt down boxes along the way, <br/>
and this is a report of all the boxes I've found or hunted for during <br/>
that time:<br/>
<br/>
Shady Coyote: Alive and well.  The box was displaced and not <br/>
where it was supposed to be, but in good condition and returned <br/>
to its proper spot.<br/>
<br/>
Gull in the Sky: Alive and well.  I've wanted to hide a box out here <br/>
for a while, and I'm glad somebody finally beat me to it!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Uvas Canyon:  The box is alive and well, but the so-called <br/>
waterfalls looked more like dry riverbeds to me.  Where I'm from <br/>
in Oregon, we don't even name waterfalls unless they're <br/>
year-round.  *wink*<br/>
<br/>
Stinky Marsh Crab: Searched and failed to find this one, but I've <br/>
heard rumors it still exists.  I refuse to believe them, though.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Towering Oaks:  Despite about 50 trees that "arch" like the clue <br/>
describes, the right one is pretty obvious once you find it.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Hog Lake Plateau:  Okay, I give--where's the lake?  I never saw a <br/>
lake.  Didn't see any hogs either for that matter.  I did see the <br/>
plateau, though.  =)  This box is alive and well, and surprisingly <br/>
well visited given its remote location!<br/>
<br/>
Ide Adobe:  Alive and well.  I was shocked to learn where this box <br/>
was hidden.  What a ballsy place to hide a box!  =)  Hint: It's <br/>
impossible to be discreet getting this box anyone is around!  <br/>
Maybe that's why it's less visited than the Hog Lake Plateau box <br/>
which is a farther drive away than this box is.  *shrug*  Wonderful <br/>
little place, though!<br/>
<br/>
Riverside Rest:  Alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
Mountain View:  I didn't find this box, but seeing as it was placed <br/>
only five days before I hunted for it, I have to believe it's still there <br/>
and hiding from my clutches.  What's more annoying than not <br/>
finding a box is not finding it and KNOWING it still has to be <br/>
there!!!!  How sharp does a right turn need to be to be a "turn" <br/>
anyhow?   <br/>
<br/>
Mt. Mazama's Treasure:  I know I had to have walked within ten <br/>
feet of this box, but I'll be darned if I could find it.  I was doing well <br/>
up until the "sleeping demons" and a "rock to rest on".  Do you <br/>
realize how many freaking rocks are out there?!!!<br/>
<br/>
Phantom Ship:  Alive, well, and well-visited too.  The last three or <br/>
four people to log in all complained that the smoke from wild <br/>
fires was ruining the view, though, and I added yet another voice <br/>
to that affect.  =)<br/>
<br/>
And I think that about covers all of my most recent finds.  Now, as <br/>
soon as I get around to it, I'll be posting clues for some new <br/>
boxes I've placed along the way.  =)<br/>
