Sheffield Village, Ohio<br/>
Lorain County Metro Parks<br/>
Lorain County, Ohio<br/>
Difficulty: easy, pleasant walk ~ 1 hour long (trail makes a nice loop)<br/>
                  There is a nice picnic area - take a lunch along.<br/>
                  The unimproved trail may be muddy after rainy weather.<br/>
Planted: October, 2001<br/>
<br/>
<b>Directions:     </b>The French Creek Reservation of the Lorain County Metro Parks can be reached by taking I-90 to the Rt. 611 exit. Go North-West on 611. The Reservation will be located on the left a short distance after passing The Backpacker's Shop and some railroad tracks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Clues:       </b>You will find the start of the Nature Center trail either from along the right hand side of the parking lot, or from the rear of the Nature Center building (you may pick up a trail map inside the Nature Center). Follow the Nature Center Trail down across the French Creek. Enjoy the view from the French Creek Overlook a short distance beyond the bridge. <br/>
<br/>
You will eventually go up a hill, at the top of which the Nature Center Trail deadends into the Big Woods trail. Take a left. Follow the Big Woods trail to the Unimproved Big Woods Trail. This trail is marked by orange trail markers on posts. To the right of the trail, 57 paces down the trail from the 4th trail marker, you will notice a tree which still has 2 'fingers' pointing to the sky, but a third finger pointing down towards you as you approach the tree walking along the trail. This tree hides the box! <br/>
<br/>
Continue walking along the trail. As it emerges onto The Big Woods Trail, take a left. This trail makes a nice loop, crossing the Pine Tree Picnic area (did you bring your lunch?) Take a left back onto the Nature Center Trail to retrace your steps to your car. </body></html>
