&gt;     I got Dan the Joshua's Trust book for Christmas.  Isn't it great!  There<br/>
&gt;are all kinds of little hiking places around that I never knew about.  Can't<br/>
&gt;wait to place or find some letterboxes out there!<br/>
<br/>
Where did you guys get your copies? I'd love to pick one up for us. I <br/>
managed to get my hands on a new Airline Trail map that East Hampton, <br/>
Colchester, and Hebron got together on and had printed up for their <br/>
completed section of the Trail. I also read that some Coasties (Coast Guard <br/>
cadets to non-southeast CTers) will be repairing the bridge over the <br/>
Blackledge River in early 2001 on the trail.<br/>

    I got my copy of the Joshua's Trust Walk book at the Denison Peqotsepos<br/>
Nature Center in Mystic.  I have also seen them at a store in Lebanon I<br/>
think it's called Lebonon Sports Center.<br/>
Where did you get the map for the Airline Trail?  I haven't had a chance to<br/>
find the boxes there yet, but it would be great to have a map when I do get<br/>
out there.<br/>
