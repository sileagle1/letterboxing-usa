&gt; I have to say I agree regarding the putting bags around the outside<br/>
&gt; of the boxes.  I had not encountered that here in WI, but when I was<br/>
&gt; in OK for Thanksgiving, several were that way - and they all had <br/>
&gt; Spiders living in the bag - right next to the boxes!!!!!  ...<br/>
&gt; So I vote for no Baggies around the boxes!!<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, the solution is to put the baggie *inside* the container. <br/>
That's SOP for geocaching - logbook and pen in a ZipLok bag inside the<br/>
ammo can, tupperware, whatever - and we've found that in most of the<br/>
LBs we've found.  Even the most-secure outside container can get water<br/>
in it, if the weather is harsh enough, but a Ziplok inside is usually<br/>
good enough to keep the logbook dry.<br/>
<br/>
One thing to note is that, for whatever reason, squirrels and many<br/>
other rodents love to gnaw on plastic.  One thing that discourages<br/>
them from doing this is to use a clear-coat rust-inhibitive spray<br/>
paint on the outside.  This runs about $5 a can, and will last for 2-3<br/>
dozen medium-sized containers.  It also works very well to inhibit<br/>
rust on metal ones.  We use Do-it Best Rust Coat enamel (clear cap),<br/>
but there are several others around.  Very cheap "insurance" :-)<br/>
