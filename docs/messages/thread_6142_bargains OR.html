artist's pads are 50% off. This includes the cool little 3.5x5" sketch books. The sale is through the 13th. <br/>
That makes them $1.26...such a deal. I also cruised the clearance aisle and found Marvy markers in some <br/>
kinda odd colors but way cheap, $.60 or less! For those of us that like to paint our stamps, you can't beat <br/>
it. I saved a bunch of money buying things I didn't even know I needed. Funhog<br/>
