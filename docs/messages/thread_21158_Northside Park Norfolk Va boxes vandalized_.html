my box was open, strewn about, and the book gone. they<br/>
were nice enough to leave the stamp. <br/>
<br/>
i saw a second box in the park i was not aware of, it<br/>
was opened but they left the lid to that one and the<br/>
baggies. i could not find your stamp or email address,<br/>
i am sorry for the placer. <br/>
<br/>
my husband thinks someone is stealing my stamps<br/>
because they are sooo good. he loves me. personally i<br/>
think there might be a malicious soul out there<br/>
tracking boxes down and dumping them. another option<br/>
is im not hiding them well enough from the general<br/>
public. maybe the local deviant teenagers are using my<br/>
spots to stash their "stash" for a later pickup. <br/>
<br/>
or it could be curious raccoons.<br/>
<br/>
whatever the cause is, it is really durn irritating,<br/>
and i will try harder to hide things, oh, fourty feet<br/>
off the trail in the middle of a bramble duct taped to<br/>
the underside of a rock. <br/>
<br/>
i will post a new location for the stamp i was left<br/>
asap. <br/>
<br/>
appologies to the other person again.<br/>
<br/>
fun boxing!<br/>
spike.<br/>
