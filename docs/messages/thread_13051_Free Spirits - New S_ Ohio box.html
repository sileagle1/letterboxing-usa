Free Spirits<br/>
<br/>
Harken back to the peace and love era of the sixties and seventies <br/>
with our whimsical little stamp named Free Spirits.  Please bring a <br/>
stamp pad (box does not have one) and come to the Lake Alma State <br/>
Park outside Wellston, Ohio.  To get there, take S.R.#93 north from <br/>
Wellston and turn onto S.R. #349 just outside of town.  S.R. #349 <br/>
will lead you a couple of miles out past the water plant and across <br/>
the dam that forms Lake Alma.  (You'd never guess that 100 years ago <br/>
the island had an amusement park and interurban trains brought people <br/>
from Columbus and elsewhere to relax here!)  After you cross the dam, <br/>
the park loop road turns off to the right past the park office and <br/>
the swimming beach.  Make your way to the Pine Hill shelter house on <br/>
top of the hill.  At the southeast corner of the shelter house, take <br/>
a bearing of 120 and go 14 paces (2 steps = 1 pace) to the edge of <br/>
the woods.  You should see a faint trail in the brush leading to a <br/>
pair of trees that have been blown over and are lying parallel in a <br/>
roughly north-south direction.  Look under the trunk of the nearest <br/>
tree where it meets the root ball and you should find our free <br/>
spirits.<br/>
