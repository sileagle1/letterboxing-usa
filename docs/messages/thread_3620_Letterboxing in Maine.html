You need to head to Bar Harbor, Maine. Go through the town and find Route 233 <br/>
west. You are heading to Eagle Lake. There are many carriage trails there. <br/>
You can either ride your bike or hike. Once you get to Eagle Lake head to the <br/>
boat landing. If you go in the summer you can park on the side of the road. <br/>
There are a couple parking areas. You need to go the boat landing and look <br/>
straight ahead at the lake. You need to head east on the carriage trail. You <br/>
can go west around the lake if you want to enjoy the view and the trails. You <br/>
will go about 50 paces and will find a stone  bench on the left hand side of <br/>
the trail. Look straight ahead the stone bench and walk between the two <br/>
closest Pine trees on the left hand side of the stone bench from the road. <br/>
Count 15 paces the letterbox is straight ahead of you under a rock with a <br/>
large metal stake coming out of it. We hope you enjoy this walk. The, <br/>
Jr.,girl scouts and brownies had a great time hiding the letterbox and going <br/>
for a hike. We plan to hide some in our town of Orland, Maine. I hope I did <br/>
this right. Beth (ac704@aol.com) Let rme know if I didn't. <br/>

<br/>
I'm going to be in Lewiston, Maine next week and just sent a message to <br/>
Oddest Goddess regarding her two boxes in that town (the only ones in <br/>
Lewiston).  However, there was a note on one of her clues from Choi, <br/>
asking her to update her e-mail address because other members' e-mails <br/>
were bouncing back from her address on file at lbna.  Anyone here have <br/>
contact with her?  <br/>
<br/>
If we don't hear from her, would it be unethical to ask if anyone else <br/>
in the area could help us with the clues?  They're rather vague in <br/>
regards to location, and I'm afraid we'll use up all our available <br/>
letterboxing time trying to figure things out unsuccessfully.  If it's <br/>
taboo to ask for hints, please forgive and disregard.  :)<br/>
<br/>
TIA,<br/>
Grace to You<br/>

"the county" is aroostock (way the freak up). but no locals use this <br/>
term. we just call it northern maine.<br/>

and for some reason (usually because in the sailing days, everything <br/>
was south of us) we we're "going down to ???" and it doesn't matter <br/>
if it's north or south of us.<br/>

now ask for the translation of "can't get there from here"<br/>

<br/>
On the Left Coast, if you live in L.A., Orange County, San Diego, etc,<br/>
"Northern California" is anything north of about Santa Barbara and the<br/>
Santa Ynez Mountains.  People in The Bay Area (San Francisco, Oakland,<br/>
etc.) call "Southern California" anything south of about Salinas,<br/>
which is an hour or so south of San Jose.  But if you live on the<br/>
Central Coast (from Ventura County to about Monterey, although some<br/>
would say just up to San Luis Obispo), most folks don't want to be<br/>
part of Southern California, or of Northern California, either.  We<br/>
live on the Central Coast, thank you very much ;-)  But anyone who<br/>
lives in Humboldt County, Del Norte County, etc. thinks of Southern<br/>
California as being everything south of Santa Rosa, which is an hour<br/>
*north* of SanFran :-o  And anyone who lives in the Sierra Nevada<br/>
thinks of the rest of the state as "The Lowlands".  And of course,<br/>
none of us really wants anything to do with Sacramento!  Most of us<br/>
just tolerate it, and ignore it when we can :-p  The only reason that<br/>
California hasn't broken up into smaller states is that, once the<br/>
process started, it wouldn't stop until there were about six or eight<br/>
pieces, none of which would have any political clout at all.  As<br/>
contentious as we are, we have more power sticking together.  Which,<br/>
of course, was the whole point in 1776, and again in 1787 :-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">downeast  refers to the coast from ellsworth (hancock county) to canada.<br/>
notice the southern area (known as the seacoast) is not included there. the<br/>
northern area thinks the seacoast is nothing more than a suburb of boston,<br/>
and the southern area thinks it's an identity of its own.  <br/>
<br/>
the reason it is called downeast is that when sailing north to maine the the<br/>
winds are to the back. maine is actually east of all other points in the u.s<br/>
a. well when you are sailing with the winds at your back it is called<br/>
downwind, maine is east, therefore you have downeast. now go in the opposite<br/>
direction and you are sailing upwind. hence the term "going up to boston"<br/>
<br/>
for the you can't get there from here.....<br/>
you have to be a mainer to understand. if you are from away, you just ain't<br/>
gonna get it. <br/>

Downeast refers to Blue Hill Peninsula or so all the way up the coast<br/>
into the Canadian Maritimes. It is called downeast because sailing<br/>
ships could sail downwind in an easterly direction to get to these<br/>
areas. While MDI is considered downeast most folks generally consider<br/>
the coastal town NE of Ellsworth the real start to downeast.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, Cumberland County does not have a lot in common with much of<br/>
the rest of Maine. Its a big big state with a lot of different<br/>
cultures, economic means and accents!Portland is "the big city!"<br/>

Well, it's been a while, but i'm baaack:)  Just finished my move to <br/>
Bangor, enjoying??? the +100" of snow and looking forward to finding <br/>
all the boxes that have been planted since I was last here as well as <br/>
planting a few of my own. Since I have permanently left Western MA, <br/>
I'm looking for volunteers(s) willing to either recover or care for a <br/>
few boxes I left behind. <br/>
See you on the trail....Kstar<br/>

My bad,  I guess I should have specified that 100" of snow has fallen so<br/>
far this winter with more to come..I certainly wasnt trying to deceive<br/>
anyone... although we do have some pretty huge piles of snow and snow<br/>
drifts that will no doubt exist well into April.  Still enough to<br/>
snowmobile on too...gone out almost every day.   Anyways..... see you on<br/>
the trail!<br/>

dang time i gotta go shovel another foot of the stuff. :) i'm going <br/>
to need a freaking pick axe to bust up that stuff at the end of my <br/>
drive. crap, good exercise i guess.<br/>
<br/>
p.s. i'm almost jealous you have so little snow. when i hear that <br/>
other folks in maine can see grass, i want to dig out my voodoo <br/>
doll :)<br/>

&gt; My bad,  I guess I should have specified that 100" of snow has <br/>
fallen so<br/>
&gt; far this winter with more to come..I certainly wasnt trying to <br/>
deceive<br/>
&gt; anyone... although we do have some pretty huge piles of snow and <br/>
snow<br/>
&gt; drifts that will no doubt exist well into April.  Still enough to<br/>
&gt; snowmobile on too...gone out almost every day.   Anyways..... see <br/>
you on<br/>
&gt; the trail!<br/>

&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bangor, enjoying??? the +100" of snow and looking forward to<br/>
&gt; &gt; finding<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all the boxes that have been planted since I was last here as <br/>
well<br/>
&gt; &gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; planting a few of my own. Since I have permanently left Western<br/>
&gt; &gt; MA,<br/>

&gt; &gt; for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; few boxes I left behind.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think Fort Kent is really way up there...!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bangor is just about as far north as I'd like to ever be <br/>
again.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I guess I live "way the freak up" then as I live<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in central Aroostook County. Yes, it is definitely<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "country" here, but I always figured western Maine was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also country (although I've never been to western<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Miane. LOL Up here there is just potato fields and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; broccoli fields----and some great snow mobileing.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "down east" is usually the coast - like bar harbour,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "the county" is aroostock (way the freak up). but no<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; locals use this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; term. we just call it northern maine.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and for some reason (usually because in the sailing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; days, everything<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was south of us) we we're "going down to ???" and it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't matter<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if it's north or south of us.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now ask for the translation of "can't get there from<br/>
