&gt;  I don't think it makes much<br/>
&gt;  difference now because of the relatively small number of adherents.  I mean<br/>
&gt;  right now being state contact has meant little more than (perhaps) getting<br/>
&gt;  an email or two from interested people in one's state....<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but none of us know how fast this will grow... least of all the<br/>
newcomers.  My conversations with the former contacts for my neighboring<br/>
states led me to believe that this unknown aspect was at least partly to blame<br/>
for their reluctance to be the responsible person.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  even if the number of people grows<br/>
&gt;  appreciably... I don't know... I wonder what it will entail - probably not<br/>
&gt;  that much even when it grows.<br/>
<br/>
In reality, very little.  I mean all the basic info is there on the web site.<br/>
I've had several people contact me already.  Aside from quickly giving them<br/>
the basic facts, the most important thing I felt I could do was try to convey<br/>
the enthusiasm and grass roots appeal that this group has built itself on.<br/>
Kinda like when you move to a new town and (hopefully) you get the "Welcome<br/>
Wagon" treatment from the whole neighborhood... but then it's nice if you can<br/>
sit for a few minutes with your next-door neighbor and have a cup of coffee.<br/>
This is the kind of personal touch the State contact(s) can provide that is<br/>
hard to duplicate in a "pre-packaged" way.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  ....some people may like the left-hand map<br/>
&gt;  (the contact map) and may not want it changed.  I think if we do change it <br/>
&gt;  should just be that clicking on a state would give you the option of<br/>
&gt;  contacting several people instead of just one person.  I think that's what<br/>
&gt;  your saying in essence, right?<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.  If we set up 50 miniature talk lists (one for each state) we could<br/>
just replace the contact person's email address with the address for the state<br/>
talk list.  Then, an inquiry for the state of Iowa, for instance, would be<br/>
forwarded to anyone and everyone interested in greeting a new person from that<br/>
state.  For states that do not yet have a contact person, some of the more<br/>
active members could volunteer to be on the list for each state in their area.<br/>
Then, we could go ahead and color in ALL the states in the left hand map.  For<br/>
instance, I might want to be included in the lists for Oregon, California,<br/>
Washington, Idaho... maybe even Kansas and Nebraska!!!  And you, or Thom, or<br/>
anyone else might want to be included on the lists for some of those same<br/>
states.  Then, when California eventually ends up with ten or twenty other<br/>
people on its list, I might choose to unsubscribe from that particular list.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine how exciting it could be for someone who has just discovered the hobby<br/>
to send a simple message requesting info... only to be greeted by two or three<br/>
or half a dozen people in their area who are already involved.  Much better<br/>
than receiving a reply from a single individual who may or may not have the<br/>
time to deal with their request at that particular moment.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, Mitch<br/>
