How do you do it?  I'm still planning my next box (in my head), and here you are sowign them like seeds in the wind.  It'a good thing you enjoy planting boxes; I'mnot keeping my end of the bargain (unspoken) am I?  Don't despair...  It is somewhat of a Catch-22 though:  I love hunting the boxes, and you have so many within my reach (???), the litle free time I have is spend hunting rather than seeding.<br/>
<br/>
I'll just have to take a week off in Spetember and just spent the time letterboxing.  BTW, I'm really close to finding VF#6. AH!!!!<br/>
<br/>
You do great work Randy, and I consider myself extremely fortunate to be reside within letterboxing distance of you.<br/>

&gt; and here you are sowign them like seeds in the wind. <br/>
<br/>
I spend alot of time outside, and have gotten in the habit of bringing<br/>
my letterboxing kit along when I do.  Since I'm outside anyway the<br/>
letterboxing doesn't really take up much extra time.  I go to <br/>
Valley Forge every day at lunch to trail run or walk around just<br/>
because its so much more beautiful than the inside of an office<br/>
building, so these letterboxes could be called "lunch boxes" :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; It is somewhat of a Catch-22 though:  I love hunting the boxes, <br/>
&gt; and you have so many within my reach (???), the litle free time <br/>
&gt; I have is spend hunting rather than seeding.<br/>
<br/>
Well, for the growth of the hobby and getting it off the ground, it<br/>
probably makes more sense to spend time hiding rather than hunting<br/>
in the beginning (assuming you have the choice), especially when my boxes <br/>
have possibly a rather narrow appeal.  Diversity in clues and locations<br/>
probably is a good thing.  That way, when the diversity as brought more<br/>
people in, you hopefully sit back and hunt most of the time.  Also, my <br/>
stamps are not that good so I am really appealing to the treasure<br/>
hunter/hiker and not the artist/collector (if I'm appealing to <br/>
anyone :-)).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; You do great work Randy, <br/>
<br/>
Thanks.  Just find the time to get outdoors, whether letterboxing or<br/>
not :-)  I'm in semi retirement on the hiding side for now (after<br/>
going well past my goal of 12 for the year); I'm going to wait until<br/>
things develop more, and possibly concentrate on Armchair Treasure<br/>
Hunting sort of stuff (although I may get a chance to put some in <br/>
some western states next month).  Since my clues are not Y2K compliant<br/>
and will probably not work when the world ends, I will wait 'till next <br/>
year to set new goals ;-)<br/>
