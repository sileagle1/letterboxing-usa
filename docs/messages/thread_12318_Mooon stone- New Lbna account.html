be sure that the ENTIRE link is being used in the conformation address. When I first tried it, all but the last number was in the link. When I added the number to the end of the link, it worked.<br/>

Subject: problems setting up account<br/>
<br/>
I tried to set up my account on the new site.  I entered my email <br/>
address, password, and name as directed.  I received my email <br/>
confirmation.  When I clicked on the link to confirm (all within <br/>
minutes of registering) I was told that my membership account did not <br/>
exist that I should register again.  When I try to register again I <br/>
am told that I cannot use my email address because it is already <br/>
being used by another user.<br/>
<br/>
what do I do?<br/>
