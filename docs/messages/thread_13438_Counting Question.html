<br/>
I am fairly new to letterboxing.  I see a lot of different ways that <br/>
lb write their counts. Some of the counts I have see are:<br/>
<br/>
F100 P55 X20 A2 E5 T2<br/>
<br/>
What do all of these mean?  I can pretty much guess the "F" as being <br/>
Found and the "P" as being planted.  But am lost on the others.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.<br/>

Wel, first - Welcome MOMOF3!<br/>
<br/>
The most common you'll see are PF and X.  <br/>
P is for boxes planted.  <br/>
F is for boxes found, and <br/>
X is for stamps exchanged with other letterboxers.  <br/>

How do you find the ones that are virtual? Just curious. I'm still <br/>
learning also.<br/>

&gt; Wel, first - Welcome MOMOF3!<br/>

&gt; The most common you'll see are PF and X.  <br/>
&gt; P is for boxes planted.  <br/>
&gt; F is for boxes found, and <br/>
&gt; X is for stamps exchanged with other letterboxers.  <br/>
&gt; From there it gets a bit more ... wild. <br/>
&gt; E is typically an event stamp (which you would get from attending a <br/>
&gt; letterboxing event in which a special stamp has been created)<br/>
&gt; HH is a hitchhiker (though some count these in the F instead)<br/>
&gt; V is virtual (these are boxes found online)<br/>
&gt; T is probably a traveler (some boxers carry travelers around and <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; have to discover these by accident - sort of)<br/>
&gt; A is ... well ... I have no clue what A is, but it meant something <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; the person who counted it!  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You'll also sometimes see ... <br/>
&gt; C for "confiscated by the National Park dudes" and <br/>
&gt; R for "rescued/repaired boxes" - or maybe for Reptiles seen on the <br/>
&gt; trail?... and even <br/>
&gt; L for Lizards!  Heck, one lucky lady even has a <br/>
&gt; PP for a proposal via letterbox!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are no rules!  <br/>
&gt; Welcome to our wacky world!<br/>
