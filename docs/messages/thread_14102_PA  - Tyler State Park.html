in Tyler State Park. I knew it wasn't going to be her cup of tea, when we<br/>
stepped out of the van and she shreiked "There are bugs out here!"  I must<br/>
admit, she was a real trooper, because it was stinking hot! I was determined<br/>
to find my first out of state Lb.  Wow... that "up the paved hill" was a<br/>
real cardiac work-out.<br/>
<br/>
We saw a ton of horses (my 6 year olds favorite animal) and my favorite<br/>
birds, bluebirds. We found the box with no problem.  However, according to<br/>
the directions, it seemed there was another one in the area.  But we had to<br/>
leave it behind for another time because the swimming pool won out over<br/>
Letterboxing in a family vote of 8 to 1!<br/>
<br/>
There's always a next time!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Homeschoolers<br/>
