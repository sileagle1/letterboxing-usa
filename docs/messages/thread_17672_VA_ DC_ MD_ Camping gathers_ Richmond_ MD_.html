<br/>
Celtic Pride had an idea for camping that they brought up at the <br/>
mystery dinner.  Something about late May near Richmond.  It's <br/>
warmer down heare in the south in't it?  Especially out of them thar <br/>
mountains.  I'll let them write it up.<br/>
<br/>
I would say there is plenty of room for two camping trips, <br/>
especially if one is further out of town.  It is never to early to <br/>
plan something and get reservations for a group.  Group place <br/>
reservations fill up early in the year.<br/>

&gt; Camping would be great. Greenbrier State Park in Hagerstown <br/>

&gt; several boxes. We took the family at the end of June and had a <br/>
&gt; great time. May might be too cold?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Would anyone be interested in this? A DC/MD/VA gather in MD?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Who would have expected 30 people would show up in the <br/>
&gt; dead of winter <br/>
&gt; &gt; to NOT go leterboxing?  Who would have dreamed 6 of them <br/>
&gt; would bring <br/>
&gt; &gt; fabulous event stamps? <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I was very happy so many Marylanders came despite the long <br/>
&gt; trip.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; There were lots of new faces and several kids.  Pictures soon.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Bethany came from Washington state. (Where they just say <br/>
&gt; Washington, <br/>
&gt; &gt; always meaning the state, not D.C.  Hope I got her name right.) <br/>
&gt; She <br/>
&gt; &gt; brought with her a half dozen traveling event stamps including <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; infamous K-MARTha.  I also saw the wonderful LbNA U.S. map <br/>
&gt; stamp.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; (more on these later)  Thanks so much for bringing them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; With the freezing cold, and only one on-site letterbox, people <br/>
&gt; stayed <br/>
&gt; &gt; and exchanged and socialized for a long time.  This was great.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; After hoping that a couple people would show up for the <br/>
&gt; mystery <br/>
&gt; &gt; dinner that evening, almost 20 arrived.  Did anyone count?  <br/>
&gt; There was <br/>
&gt; &gt; even a surprise mystery guest whose long name begins with <br/>
&gt; L. Then <br/>
&gt; &gt; someone realized there was no mystery dinner stamp and 2 <br/>
&gt; were quickly <br/>
&gt; &gt; carved at the table.  Too cool.  Of course, I still can't say <br/>
where <br/>
&gt; &gt; the mystery dinner was. :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Many, many thanks to Eileen of Celtic Pride for arriving early <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; helping set up, and for the mystery location.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Many thanks for all the great event stamps.  That was a real <br/>
&gt; surprise <br/>
&gt; &gt; for me and a delight to all.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for all for coming and sharing.<br/>

My daughter's Girl Scout troop LOVED the Maple Tree House Campground.  BUT it <br/>
DOES get incredibly cold since you've no insulation below you.  Definitely want to wait <br/>
til at LEAST June for that one.  <br/>
<br/>
And I hope you guys will plan a day part of the event for those of us who can't <br/>
possibly go camping at that time of the year. (The aforementioned Girl Scouts keep us <br/>
very very busy in May/June!<br/>

That would be great!  I'm dying to camp and I so sadly missed last Saturdays <br/>
great-sounding gather.  I vote for late Spring, as that's a bit lower on the <br/>
mosquito-scale.  I would also like to suggest a reservation at Assateague, <br/>
which is a federal park with sites for campers and tents, where there's beach, <br/>
ponies, canoeing, incredible bird watching and beautiful landscapes,  among other <br/>
things. Reservations are dear after Memorial Day.  What about that?  Mother <br/>

That's a good point - are there people who would want to come who would need <br/>
