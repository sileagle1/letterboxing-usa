                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is an update on a box in Southern Nevada that was listed on the old site and <br/>
placed by Amanda from Seattle.<br/>
<br/>
This was my second time out there looking for this box, and after some political <br/>
maneuvering with a colleague I was able to locate the first right clue tree, whose <br/>
plaque had been obscured by Bermuda Grass.  That problem solved, I went to the <br/>
second tree in the clue and, most curiously, after an extensive search of all <br/>
available nooks and crannies, discovered an eaten away ziplock bag and a small <br/>
wooden marker with compass directions, coordinates and a "look for the screw" note <br/>
written on it.  Looked more like a G-C clue than a letterbox thing.<br/>
<br/>
A quick look on the G-C site confirmed that there were at least four of those things in <br/>
the vicinity, so I wanted to double-check and see if indeed this wooden marker is part <br/>
of the One-Armed Bandit hunt or if this location has been ursurped by the other <br/>
parties.  I'm pretty new to this...I got a splinter, though, while looking which adds <br/>
some experience points I should think.<br/>

Yeah, I'm pretty sure this box is gone for good.  Which is why <br/>
Amanda doesn't have it on the new letterboxing site anymore.<br/>
