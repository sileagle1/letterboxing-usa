                    <div class="plaintext-content">There's been some discussion of geocaching lately, so I thought I'd provide <br/>
some background on that activity, especially as it relates to letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, geocaching is a lot like letterboxing, while being quite <br/>
different from it. (Think of a racing cyclist and a mountain biker; someone <br/>
who doesn't ride a bike thinks that both activities are quite alike, while <br/>
enthusiasts of each activity look at the other as being quite different.)<br/>
<br/>
A geocache is hidden (in the woods, in the city, in a park, under water), <br/>
but instead of clues, longitude and latitude coordinates that point to the <br/>
cache location are published. Using a GPS (global positioning system) <br/>
handheld unit (available for as little as $99), other geocachers then try <br/>
to find the cache. GPS accuracy ranges from 12 to 70 feet depending on <br/>
cloud cover, terrain and the unit itself, so it's not like a finder just <br/>
walks up to the cache and "finds" it. Once your GPS gets you within range, <br/>
you have to start a search for likely hiding spots in the area -- depending <br/>
on the accuracy of the hider's GPS and your GPS, the area could be 150 <br/>
square feet or more in size.<br/>
<br/>
Though many geocachers don't use maps, a bit of advance planning is often <br/>
required to find available trails and the best route to the cache, unless <br/>
you want to bushwhack through the forest. A geocache typically includes a <br/>
log as well as trinkets -- the idea is that the finders will swap an item <br/>
in the geocache with something they've brought along. Personally, I think <br/>
this is a kinda dumb practice (and it's amazing how often ill-informed <br/>
geocachers leave food or candy), but geocachers probably think those <br/>
hand-carved stamps are kinda dumb, too. I'm not alone -- many geocachers <br/>
simply log in to finds with the annotation "TNLN," "took nothing, left <br/>
nothing." Some geocaches also include clues that must be figured out before <br/>
the cache can be found, and these can be just as creative as letterbox clues.<br/>
<br/>
It's probably an overgeneralization to say that geocachers are <br/>
"destructive." One thing you have to remember is that there are many times <br/>
more geocachers than letterboxers. Compare the sheer numbers: As of <br/>
9/22/03, there are 68,796 active geocaches in 185 countries (but mostly in <br/>
the US). In the last 7 days, 9,311 geocachers logged 36,794 caches (either <br/>
as found or not found). There are probably more than 50,000 geocachers in <br/>
the US.<br/>
<br/>
As of today, there are 6,821 letterboxes planted around the US, and there <br/>
are just over 1,000 letterboxers on this list; perhaps another 3,000 (by my <br/>
estimate) who are active but don't belong to the discussion list.<br/>
<br/>
With nearly 10 times as many geocaches and geocachers out there looking for <br/>
them, it's no surprise that geocachers often stumble onto letterboxes. A <br/>
good hiding space for a letterbox is usually a good hiding space for a <br/>
geocache, so there's often quite a lot of overlap; just yesterday, a <br/>
geocacher found one of my Superboxer series while looking for a place to <br/>
hide her cache. She was polite enough to write me to tell me that it was in <br/>
good shape, even though she didn't have a clue about letterboxing (I'll <br/>
never get tired of that pun <g>).<br/>
<br/>
So, sure, there are irresponsible geocachers, just like there are <br/>
irresponsible letterboxers. But with 5 to 10 times as many geocachers out <br/>
there, the damage that even careful searching can do is often much more <br/>
pronounced.<br/>
<br/>
You can learn more about it at www.geocaching.com. You don't need a GPS to <br/>
join the site, and you can search for geocaches in your zip code or area <br/>
(you can also use a site like topozone.com to find your own GPS <br/>
coordinates). Each cache on the site has maps linked to mapquest.com, so <br/>
you can get a general idea of the location of caches in your area -- and if <br/>
there might be one in the vicinity of a letterbox you've planted. This <br/>
won't stop a geocacher from planting a geocache a few feet from yours, but <br/>
if that happens you might want to leave a note in your letterbox to inform <br/>
geocachers who inadvertently find it that it's not what they're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
I often carry my GPS when I'm letterboxing, and can then see if there are <br/>
geocaches along the same trail, which makes for an added bonus.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it's in the best interests of both activities if we respect <br/>
each other and try to get along as best we can. Unfortunately, there's no <br/>
practical way that we can expect to educate all those geocachers about <br/>
letterboxing, so the onus is on us to do more than our share.<br/>

We actually got into letterboxing from geocaching, basically because<br/>
found the "trinkets" pretty silly sometimes.  Some geocachers have<br/>
signature trinkets that are pretty nice, but a lot just leave little<br/>
toys.  The travel bugs, however, are a lot of fun.  Much like<br/>
hitchhikers except that you can track their progress online.  Most<br/>
geocachers don't bushwack unless absolutely necessary, however more<br/>
trampling is often involved than is the case in letterboxing.  The<br/>
whole idea of the puzzles in letterboxing, however, caught our fancy,<br/>
and the carving just adds to the fun.  We have become so hooked on<br/>
letterboxing that I have 3 or four geocaching bugs that I've never<br/>
released because I lost interest and/or ran out of time for both<br/>
hobbies.  Using the GPS to get you to the correct starting point<br/>
(parking lot, etc.) for a letterbox find, however, is fun to do.  We<br/>
often use topozone to look at the area, figure out GPS coordinates,<br/>
and use the GPS in addition to maps to plot our travels.  <br/>

Two harmless types of geocache which deserve mention are <br/>
the "virtual" and the "locationless". For a virtual, you really do <br/>
go to a location, and have to find the answer to a question for the <br/>
placer to verify your find. My husband has done this with neat spots <br/>
containing letterboxes and not enough room in the area for another <br/>
hidden object.<br/>
Locationless are not caches at all either. It's a classification of <br/>
object, and when you find one, you post it's location with a picture <br/>
including your GPS unit. Sounds silly, but makes for great online <br/>
fun for the "placer". We've been tracking postings of original <br/>

the next geocacher took my stamp.  Some of this was my ignorance..<br/>
<br/>
1) I never thought to look see if there was a geocache around first <br/>
before I planted the box and it would not have helped since this one <br/>
geocache was planted after my letterbox. Perhaps this should be in <br/>
the HOW TO PLANT a LETTERBOX advice? Perhaps something could be <br/>
added to the GEOCACHER HOW TO WEB SITES?<br/>
<br/>
2) I never thought to put LEAVE do NOT TAKE on the stamp and this is <br/>
not a geocache please do NOT COMBINE in my box. Perhaps this should <br/>
be in the HOW TO PLANT a LETTERBOX advice or letter?<br/>
<br/>
3) the once overgrown hidding place was soo stomped up and the <br/>
geocache box was so big that anyone could find it.. We had hidden a <br/>
small jar with black tape all gone only my log to trace the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
I have emailed the stamp taker someone did respond that they would <br/>
look for it but that thier house is a mess...I even had the <br/>
letterbox notice translated into spanish (important out here in CA)<br/>

&gt; There's been some discussion of geocaching lately, so I thought <br/>
I'd provide <br/>
&gt; some background on that activity, especially as it relates to <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Essentially, geocaching is a lot like letterboxing, while being <br/>
quite <br/>
&gt; different from it. (Think of a racing cyclist and a mountain <br/>
biker; someone <br/>
&gt; who doesn't ride a bike thinks that both activities are quite <br/>
alike, while <br/>
&gt; enthusiasts of each activity look at the other as being quite <br/>
different.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A geocache is hidden (in the woods, in the city, in a park, under <br/>
water), <br/>
&gt; but instead of clues, longitude and latitude coordinates that <br/>
point to the <br/>
&gt; cache location are published. Using a GPS (global positioning <br/>
system) <br/>
&gt; handheld unit (available for as little as $99), other geocachers <br/>
then try <br/>
&gt; to find the cache. GPS accuracy ranges from 12 to 70 feet <br/>
depending on <br/>
&gt; cloud cover, terrain and the unit itself, so it's not like a <br/>
finder just <br/>
&gt; walks up to the cache and "finds" it. Once your GPS gets you <br/>
within range, <br/>
&gt; you have to start a search for likely hiding spots in the area -- <br/>
depending <br/>
&gt; on the accuracy of the hider's GPS and your GPS, the area could be <br/>
150 <br/>
&gt; square feet or more in size.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Though many geocachers don't use maps, a bit of advance planning <br/>
is often <br/>
&gt; required to find available trails and the best route to the cache, <br/>
unless <br/>
&gt; you want to bushwhack through the forest. A geocache typically <br/>
includes a <br/>
&gt; log as well as trinkets -- the idea is that the finders will swap <br/>
an item <br/>
&gt; in the geocache with something they've brought along. Personally, <br/>
I think <br/>
&gt; this is a kinda dumb practice (and it's amazing how often ill-<br/>
informed <br/>
&gt; geocachers leave food or candy), but geocachers probably think <br/>
those <br/>
&gt; hand-carved stamps are kinda dumb, too. I'm not alone -- many <br/>
geocachers <br/>
&gt; simply log in to finds with the annotation "TNLN," "took nothing, <br/>
left <br/>
&gt; nothing." Some geocaches also include clues that must be figured <br/>
out before <br/>
&gt; the cache can be found, and these can be just as creative as <br/>
letterbox clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's probably an overgeneralization to say that geocachers are <br/>
&gt; "destructive." One thing you have to remember is that there are <br/>
many times <br/>
&gt; more geocachers than letterboxers. Compare the sheer numbers: As <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; 9/22/03, there are 68,796 active geocaches in 185 countries (but <br/>
mostly in <br/>
&gt; the US). In the last 7 days, 9,311 geocachers logged 36,794 caches <br/>
(either <br/>
&gt; as found or not found). There are probably more than 50,000 <br/>
geocachers in <br/>
&gt; the US.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As of today, there are 6,821 letterboxes planted around the US, <br/>
and there <br/>
&gt; are just over 1,000 letterboxers on this list; perhaps another <br/>
3,000 (by my <br/>
&gt; estimate) who are active but don't belong to the discussion list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With nearly 10 times as many geocaches and geocachers out there <br/>
looking for <br/>
&gt; them, it's no surprise that geocachers often stumble onto <br/>
letterboxes. A <br/>
&gt; good hiding space for a letterbox is usually a good hiding space <br/>
for a <br/>
&gt; geocache, so there's often quite a lot of overlap; just yesterday, <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; geocacher found one of my Superboxer series while looking for a <br/>
place to <br/>
&gt; hide her cache. She was polite enough to write me to tell me that <br/>
it was in <br/>
&gt; good shape, even though she didn't have a clue about letterboxing <br/>
(I'll <br/>
&gt; never get tired of that pun <g>).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, sure, there are irresponsible geocachers, just like there are <br/>
&gt; irresponsible letterboxers. But with 5 to 10 times as many <br/>
geocachers out <br/>
&gt; there, the damage that even careful searching can do is often much <br/>
more <br/>
&gt; pronounced.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can learn more about it at www.geocaching.com. You don't need <br/>
a GPS to <br/>
&gt; join the site, and you can search for geocaches in your zip code <br/>
or area <br/>
&gt; (you can also use a site like topozone.com to find your own GPS <br/>
&gt; coordinates). Each cache on the site has maps linked to <br/>
mapquest.com, so <br/>
&gt; you can get a general idea of the location of caches in your area -<br/>
- and if <br/>
&gt; there might be one in the vicinity of a letterbox you've planted. <br/>
This <br/>
&gt; won't stop a geocacher from planting a geocache a few feet from <br/>
yours, but <br/>
&gt; if that happens you might want to leave a note in your letterbox <br/>
to inform <br/>
&gt; geocachers who inadvertently find it that it's not what they're <br/>
looking for.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I often carry my GPS when I'm letterboxing, and can then see if <br/>
there are <br/>
&gt; geocaches along the same trail, which makes for an added bonus.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All in all, it's in the best interests of both activities if we <br/>
respect <br/>
&gt; each other and try to get along as best we can. Unfortunately, <br/>
there's no <br/>
&gt; practical way that we can expect to educate all those geocachers <br/>
about <br/>
&gt; letterboxing, so the onus is on us to do more than our share.<br/>

I didn't mean to stir up a hornets nest here...however I do value every single persons opinion on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I did give much thought and consideration before attempting to petition the group for supplies. However, with that in mind...I do not wish to shed and bad light on the sport and if placing boxes here may do that...than by all means I will refrain.<br/>
<br/>
However, I am still very confident that by placing the boxes in buildings (with the inhabitants knowledge and blessing...sort of like my VA wine trail box) it will ensure that noone will figure it to be any type of bomb or terrorist device.<br/>
<br/>
That way the guy behind the desk (counter or whatever) will "hand over the box" only when specifically asked..or maybe given a codeword once the clues are figured out.<br/>

<br/>
Well, in my not so humble opinion, and I mean no disrespect when I say this,<br/>
but the two are completely different other than the foundation.  To say that<br/>
they are the same because one hides something and others find it is like<br/>
saying that a Ford and a Ferrari or BMW or Jaguar or MG are the same because<br/>
they all use gasoline and oil.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying that all geocachers destroy the environment, nor am I saying<br/>
that all letterboxers are it's champions either.  I am saying that, because<br/>
of the sheer numbers, the same numbers that you quote, it becomes more a<br/>
game of quantity than quality.<br/>
<br/>
It has been my experience that most people in today's society, and I'm not<br/>
pointing fingers at anyone,  want the easy things, they want things given to<br/>
them, they'd rather someone else did the work for them.  They are by far,<br/>
much to lazy to exercise their brain, let alone their legs.  Bu that's not<br/>
the main point here.<br/>
<br/>
First and foremost, if you enjoy letterboxing, then by all means do<br/>
letterboxing.  If you enjoy geocaching, do geocaching.  Whichever hobby to<br/>
decide upon, or if you decide upon both, more power to you.  In this day and<br/>
age, finding people that are respectful of themselves, let alone, other<br/>
people, or even the environment, is a rare thing.  Respect the environment,<br/>
become it's steward, there's not much left and what is left, is being<br/>
damaged at a rate that will overwhelm you if it doesn't make you bury your<br/>
head in the sand and pretend it's not happening.  This isn't about which<br/>
ones better, letterboxing or geocaching, nor is it about which makes you a<br/>
better person, neither do that. Only you can make a difference, and it has<br/>
become my experience that far to few strive to make that change within<br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I'm no better than anyone on this list and if any of my words have come<br/>
across in that manner here and now or before, I apologize and beg your<br/>
forgiveness.  My intent is to share my thoughts and ideas, my feelings and<br/>
to learn from you. No to harp and tell you how it must be.  I am a very<br/>
strong willed person and tend to vocally (Whether in real time or here in<br/>
cyberspace) share those thoughts.  (Grin)<br/>
<br/>
I personally will not become a geocacher. It does not draw me only for one<br/>
reason.  Using a technological device to drive to the spot where the hidden<br/>
treasure lies (+/- 25 feet or more, depending on the accuracy of the device<br/>
being used initially) is not something that I find a thrill in. On the other<br/>
hand, using my story telling abilities to weave a story, my limited carving<br/>
abilities to create a one of a kind, work of art to some, a simple rubber<br/>
stamp to others, to find the location to place that letterbox, to place it<br/>
and to watch and wait for a report that someone has found it, that's what<br/>
draws me.<br/>
<br/>
And it makes me no better or worse than anyone else.<br/>

P.S.  If there's only a few letterboxes in your area, plant more.  "Plant it<br/>
and they will come!" is the motto of our website. Tell others about your<br/>
hobby and share it.  Before you know it, you'll have more letterboxes than<br/>
you can shake a stick at and you'll have fostered some of the best<br/>
friendships you can imagine, all because you shared your passion with your<br/>
fellow man (Or woman).  Give it a try, what's the worst that can happen? No<br/>
one else ever plants any letterboxes and you continue on geocaching.  Just a<br/>
thought.<br/>

I am sure you can drive to within 25 feet of where it is hidden, so <br/>
even letterboxers hide those types (which I am sure are appreciated <br/>
by those who are handicapped but would like to participate in this <br/>
hobby also).   <br/>
<br/>
I am in the same situation Nana is in and feel the same way she <br/>
does.  There are only a few letterboxes near me and almost 500 <br/>
geocaches within a 100 mile radius.  I enjoy both but there aren't <br/>
enough letterboxes to hunt.  I have hidden a few and hope <br/>
letterboxing becomes more popular in this area, but it sounds like <br/>
you don't want that to happen either because then it will become a <br/>
game of "quantity not quality".<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy the stamp carving aspect of letterboxing and seeing other's <br/>
artwork.  I have also gotten some pretty neat handmade items out of <br/>
geocaches.  There are limitations on hiding geocaches where you <br/>
can't get good satellite reception due to heavy tree cover, but <br/>
there are also limitations on hiding letterboxes in places where <br/>
there aren't any good landmarks to clue people into.  Both hobbies <br/>
have taken me to very cool places that I might not have been to <br/>
otherwise, therefore I am going to continue to do both.   <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, in my not so humble opinion, and I mean no disrespect when I <br/>
say this,<br/>
&gt; but the two are completely different other than the foundation.  <br/>
To say that<br/>
&gt; they are the same because one hides something and others find it <br/>
is like<br/>
&gt; saying that a Ford and a Ferrari or BMW or Jaguar or MG are the <br/>
same because<br/>
&gt; they all use gasoline and oil.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm not saying that all geocachers destroy the environment, nor am <br/>
I saying<br/>
&gt; that all letterboxers are it's champions either.  I am saying <br/>
that, because<br/>
&gt; of the sheer numbers, the same numbers that you quote, it becomes <br/>
more a<br/>
&gt; game of quantity than quality.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It has been my experience that most people in today's society, and <br/>
I'm not<br/>
&gt; pointing fingers at anyone,  want the easy things, they want <br/>
things given to<br/>
&gt; them, they'd rather someone else did the work for them.  They are <br/>
by far,<br/>
&gt; much to lazy to exercise their brain, let alone their legs.  Bu <br/>
that's not<br/>
&gt; the main point here.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First and foremost, if you enjoy letterboxing, then by all means do<br/>
&gt; letterboxing.  If you enjoy geocaching, do geocaching.  Whichever <br/>
hobby to<br/>
&gt; decide upon, or if you decide upon both, more power to you.  In <br/>
this day and<br/>
&gt; age, finding people that are respectful of themselves, let alone, <br/>
other<br/>
&gt; people, or even the environment, is a rare thing.  Respect the <br/>
environment,<br/>
&gt; become it's steward, there's not much left and what is left, is <br/>
being<br/>
&gt; damaged at a rate that will overwhelm you if it doesn't make you <br/>
bury your<br/>
&gt; head in the sand and pretend it's not happening.  This isn't about <br/>
which<br/>
&gt; ones better, letterboxing or geocaching, nor is it about which <br/>
makes you a<br/>
&gt; better person, neither do that. Only you can make a difference, <br/>
and it has<br/>
&gt; become my experience that far to few strive to make that change <br/>
within<br/>
&gt; themselves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm no better than anyone on this list and if any of my words have <br/>
come<br/>
&gt; across in that manner here and now or before, I apologize and beg <br/>
your<br/>
&gt; forgiveness.  My intent is to share my thoughts and ideas, my <br/>
feelings and<br/>
&gt; to learn from you. No to harp and tell you how it must be.  I am a <br/>
very<br/>
&gt; strong willed person and tend to vocally (Whether in real time or <br/>
here in<br/>
&gt; cyberspace) share those thoughts.  (Grin)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I personally will not become a geocacher. It does not draw me only <br/>
for one<br/>
&gt; reason.  Using a technological device to drive to the spot where <br/>
the hidden<br/>
&gt; treasure lies (+/- 25 feet or more, depending on the accuracy of <br/>
the device<br/>
&gt; being used initially) is not something that I find a thrill in. On <br/>
the other<br/>
&gt; hand, using my story telling abilities to weave a story, my <br/>
limited carving<br/>
&gt; abilities to create a one of a kind, work of art to some, a simple <br/>
rubber<br/>
&gt; stamp to others, to find the location to place that letterbox, to <br/>
place it<br/>
&gt; and to watch and wait for a report that someone has found it, <br/>
that's what<br/>
&gt; draws me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And it makes me no better or worse than anyone else.<br/>

&gt; P.S.  If there's only a few letterboxes in your area, plant <br/>
more.  "Plant it<br/>
&gt; and they will come!" is the motto of our website. Tell others <br/>
about your<br/>
&gt; hobby and share it.  Before you know it, you'll have more <br/>
letterboxes than<br/>
&gt; you can shake a stick at and you'll have fostered some of the best<br/>
&gt; friendships you can imagine, all because you shared your passion <br/>
with your<br/>
&gt; fellow man (Or woman).  Give it a try, what's the worst that can <br/>
happen? No<br/>
&gt; one else ever plants any letterboxes and you continue on <br/>
geocaching.  Just a<br/>
&gt; thought.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I'm not sure what the hub bub is all about.  I am new to <br/>
Letterboxing<br/>
&gt; &gt; just this past summer.  There are exactly 4 letterboxes in my <br/>
area and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have found them all.  The number of Geocaches in my area is <br/>
astounding.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I could be kept busy for years.  Isn't the point to get out <br/>
there and<br/>
&gt; &gt; enjoy the world that God has created?  Not, who put what in what <br/>
box and<br/>
&gt; &gt; how did you find it!  I don't think there is enough difference <br/>
between<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing and geocaching to created such a stir.  I have <br/>
crossed<br/>
&gt; &gt; over, but I am still just as respectful of my surroundings as I <br/>
was when<br/>
&gt; &gt; I found my very first letterbox.  There is enough conflict in <br/>
the world<br/>
&gt; &gt; around us....why can't we realize we are all the same and play <br/>
nice<br/>
&gt; &gt; together?<br/>
