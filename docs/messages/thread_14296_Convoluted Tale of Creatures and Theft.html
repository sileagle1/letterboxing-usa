weave you a tale of letterboxing and the consequences of being too <br/>
forward about the pasttime.<br/>
<br/>
My lovely and loving daughter, Ash Raven, has remarked ("complained" <br/>
is too strong of word, even when the act is accompanied by <br/>
eyerolling) about yours truly "witnessing" to folk about <br/>
letterboxing. I try to remind her that if JugglerMouse had not told <br/>
US that we would not be now so involved. I don't know if you have <br/>
such conversations with teens of your own but you must guess that an <br/>
older adult cannot win such an exchange. I would expect JugglerMouse <br/>
to support me in my case for telling others. Right! She also has <br/>
worried (aloud) about me doing this. Nice to know that not only am I <br/>
loved but also my judgement is respected.<br/>
<br/>
The next thread in this tangled web also involves Ash Raven. So far, <br/>
though she has HELPED in planted many boxes, she has only CARVED one <br/>
and planted it solo: Creatures of the Night. She placed that stamp in <br/>
her place of work, her first steadily paying job. A week or two ago, <br/>
the stamp and its microbox was missing. Since Ash Raven does not <br/>
really know her boss and her boss' mother that well, she assumed that <br/>
one of them had found it and discarded it. The hiding place was bare. <br/>
Oh well, said Ash Raven.<br/>
<br/>
Friday evening JugglerMouse and I had just dropped off Ash Raven to <br/>
visit her mother. JM and I were heading back home and decided to stop <br/>
at a restaurant to have some Atkins' approved food, hamburgers <br/>
without buns. There is a wonderfully funny waitress there whom we had <br/>
met twice before. Okay, while flirting with her I did explain about <br/>
the stamp I was carving, the series I had just planted and about <br/>
www.letterboxing.org. That was at the first meeting. On the second <br/>
occasion, she asked for the site URL once again, vowing to go out and <br/>
find some of the boxes. This time she was on break but came over to <br/>
talk with us.<br/>
<br/>
She gushed about how she found the website, went out letterboxing and <br/>
got her first box. Then she asked the fatal question: "Ah, do you <br/>
TAKE the boxes with you?"<br/>
<br/>
I groaned just a little in mock horror. She could not be serious, <br/>
right? "No, you are just supposed to stamp in on them, stamp their <br/>
stamp in your box and put it back." <br/>
<br/>
"Oh," she said. Her face kind of fell.<br/>
<br/>
"Which box?"<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, you know I just LOVE bats. See these tattoos? I will put it <br/>
back, honest! It was the Creatures of the Night one."<br/>
<br/>
So JugglerMouse and I convulsed with laughter at our sudden <br/>
understanding, especially about kicking a rock down the mountain and <br/>
then seeing the landslide afterward. And no, we are not going to tell <br/>
the Raven today about her box. We want it just to reappear. She does <br/>
not read this board and so it is safe to post this.<br/>
<br/>
And I am STILL telling others about letterboxing. Let her roll her <br/>
eyes,<br/>
