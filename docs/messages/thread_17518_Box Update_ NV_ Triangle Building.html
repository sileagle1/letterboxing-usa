Also, Suzanne, you are welcome to plant a One-Armed Bandit of your <br/>

carved and I regret that it has gone missing. I so seldom get to the <br/>
area, that I decided to retire the box rather than maintain it! <br/>

<br/>
Will do!  I started carving a new one this morning.  I plan to put it <br/>
in essentially the same spot (great spot!).  Can I still use your <br/>
clue to it?<br/>
