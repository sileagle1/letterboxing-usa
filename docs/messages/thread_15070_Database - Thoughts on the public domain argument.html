<br/>
While you are probably *technically* correct about the public domain <br/>
argument, it seems to go against the whole grain of the "letterboxing <br/>
spirit" if indeed there is one. To me, this mean mutual respect for <br/>
each other and the desire to communicate and share thoughts and stamp <br/>
images. After all, what happens to the box log book when it's full? <br/>
The placer takes it home, (hopefully) replaces it, and perhaps takes <br/>
enjoyment from reading the comments and seeing the personal stamps of <br/>
all who have visited.<br/>
<br/>
It's easy to say "well you made it public so now we can do what we <br/>
want with it" but then it's just as easy for people like the Drew <br/>
Clan and others to simply withdraw all their boxes and not <br/>
participate. This is a lose-lose situation for all. The U.S.A. is a <br/>
bit bigger than the Dartmoor area geographically (purposeful <br/>
understatement) so hence we all communicate primarily electronically. <br/>
But I don't think this means we necessarily have to ignore the basic <br/>
respect we could have for one another. <br/>
<br/>
I like to think of this list rather like a big pub on the edge of the <br/>
moors...a loud raucous place with people arguing, discussing, giving <br/>
tips, asking questions, and (probably) getting tipsy on occasion. The <br/>
analogy to the original hobby is still alive and kicking if you look <br/>
hard enough.<br/>
<br/>
Just some random thoughts, spewed onto my keyboard. :)<br/>

&gt; Ms Alafair,<br/>
&gt; With all due respect to you who has been a benefactor to the Nail <br/>
&gt; Family, I would like to express my opinion on the matter of a <br/>
&gt; database.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my opinion, if a box placer does not want his/her boxes to be <br/>
&gt; subject to sit-reps, database reports, spoilers and the like, then <br/>
&gt; that person should not make the clues public.  I believe that I <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; a right to express my exprerience in a public forum and if the <br/>
boxes <br/>
&gt; I have found have been made available to me by a public forum then <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; have every right to report on them as I experience them, whether <br/>
&gt; found or not, whether I am correct in assuming missing or not. I <br/>
&gt; have the respect to not report a box as absolutely missing and I <br/>
&gt; also have the wisdom to not spoil a location, especially a mystery <br/>
&gt; one.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I, as a box creator and placer, do not want my creations subject <br/>
&gt; to such reports I can limit who has access to the clues. This will <br/>
&gt; limit the number of people who will find the boxes but it will also <br/>
&gt; give me some control over that aspect.  It also adds to the <br/>
mystique <br/>
&gt; of the sport in some cases.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is the risk in having boxes available to the general public: <br/>
&gt; public knowledge-public access.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my 2 cents.<br/>

but I took too long and the connection timed out. :0)<br/>
<br/>
I will just say this, I agree it is a shame that such pioneers as <br/>
the Drew Clan have left.  I know of others who have been actually <br/>
banished for what others percieve as intentions contrary to popular <br/>
opinion. And I know, personally, another prominent boxer who was <br/>
almost removed due to him sharing his opinions of what makes a good, <br/>
fair, and what he termed crappy stamp. Feelings are getting hurt <br/>
over plastic and rubber, this is crazy.<br/>
<br/>
I hold that my creations are mine to release.  I post my clues for <br/>
all to use.  I am ok with whatever someone says about them whether <br/>
good, bad, indiferent or even malicious.  It is just plastic and <br/>
rubber, not life and death.<br/>
<br/>
If others desire to not have their creations subject to public <br/>
discussion then they have two choices.  They can either not <br/>
distribute them publicly (still they risk someone divulging <br/>
information even when they hand distribute them--betrayal is nothing <br/>
new in this world) or they can simply ask that those accessing their <br/>
boxes not put any information on the public sites.  Those who choose <br/>
to keep them public but ask for their clues to be kept out of <br/>
discussions must trust that those who do access them will abide by <br/>
their wishes.  If they dont, that is too bad, it is the risk.  <br/>
<br/>
I will abide by anyone's wishes to keep their boxes out of <br/>
discussions.  I will not knowingly divulge any information about any <br/>
boxes where the clue writer asks for them to be withheld.  I will <br/>
respect all owners wishes if they are known to me.  I would ask that <br/>
all others abide by such wishes too.  I would also ask, however, <br/>
that no one deride someone who does not abide by these wishes but to <br/>
rather send them a message off list and advise them that the creator <br/>
has asked to not have such information made public.  In my early <br/>
letterboxing months someone did such a favor to me when I posted a <br/>
message that got close to revealing a mystery location. I was <br/>
grateful for the respectful rebuke off list and have since chosen my <br/>
posts very carefully.  Perhaps if others would be so quick to <br/>
forgive and slow to judge we could all get back to the fun of boxing <br/>
and not get our feelings hurt so easily.<br/>
<br/>
The discussion, however, is good for the sport.  I would encourage <br/>
this discussion to continue.  This is truly a growing pain and we <br/>
all know that there is no gain without pain.  Keep the talk flowing <br/>
but lets all agree to not get too emotional and steel our feelings <br/>
to accept those who ask FAQ questions, post spoilers, get a little <br/>
touchy themselves about an issue close to their heart, or just plain <br/>
act stupidly whether they be the greenest newbie or the most finger <br/>
stained veteran.  IT IS JUST PLASTIC AND RUBBER!!<br/>
<br/>
I will gladly accept any responses and will not flame anyone. <br/>
