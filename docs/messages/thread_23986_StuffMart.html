Dude!  You gotta be kidding me!  Yeah, I missed the ads because I <br/>
don't watch ads when I watch TV - I mute or switch channels; or I tape <br/>
and fast-forward.  Ok, doctors, nurses, fire fighters, police - those <br/>
folks needs to work on holidays.<br/>
<br/>
Should I assume you are using "StuffMart" as a euphemism for <br/>
SprawlMart? (Yes, I know, that's a euphemism too...but we don't wanna <br/>
get sued here!)<br/>

<br/>
Let me just say Thank You!  For being there when you are needed.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm...perhaps a new letterbox series is called for...A BIG Thank You <br/>
to nurses, doctors, EMTs, etc.!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you had a happy, festive and joyous Thanksgiving, and offer <br/>
best wishes for a happy holiday season!<br/>

Nope, no assumptions. It was another chain altogether. I have no love<br/>
for any particular big box store (except, of course, Bob's House of<br/>
Discount Big Boxes) but I won't soil the name of a company that wasn't<br/>
the offender.<br/>
