                    <div class="plaintext-content">I tried last week to find this box but was unsuccessful, which was quite disappointing since it was a rigourous climb to the top of Castle Rock.  I went there right after it was placed, along with my beagle and 8-year old daughter, not knowing what I was getting myself into!  The term "hike" is used somewhat broadly here - I would call it more of a "mountain climb."  My dog and daughter did okay, but it was a little scary for me, their mom, at times.<br/>
<br/>
So James, I'm not sure where I went wrong.  I'm pretty sure I was in the right place (saw the vultures, for example) but could never find the "2 small boulders" mentioned in your clue.  Did the Hikergrlz find it?  or had they just been on  the hike up to the Rock before and knew how challenging it is?  <br/>

&gt; For anyone in the east bay area, you should know a few things about the castle rock box.  Please please please wear good hiking shoes..tennies won't really cut it.  The last part of the hike is quite steep and slippery during summer.  The spot where the box is located is a nesting ground for peregrine falcons and vultures as well!  Enjoy, and thanks Hikergrlz!<br/>
