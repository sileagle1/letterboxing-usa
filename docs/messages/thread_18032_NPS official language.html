<br/>
Geocaching  There is a new web-based activity called geocaching <br/>
that has affected several National Park Service areas. The Ranger <br/>
Activities Division asked Olympic NP SA Mike Butler to investigate. <br/>
Here's his report: Geocaching is an activity in which participants <br/>
hide a cache and take a position at the location using a GPS <br/>
receiver. The position is then published on the group's web site <br/>
with an invitation to search for the "treasure." Caches often <br/>
contain a notebook or log book and something the finder may take. <br/>
The finder is asked to put another item in the cache for others to <br/>
discover and will often report the find on the web site. Several <br/>
caches have been found in National Park Service areas. The webmaster <br/>
for the site (www.geocaching.com) has been contacted. He was very <br/>
surprised that geocaching is illegal in NPS areas, and understood <br/>
NPS concerns about the damage geocaching has and can cause to <br/>
historic, archeological and natural sites. He agreed to work with <br/>
the Service to discourage further geocaching activities in parks. <br/>
Two related activities were also discovered. Letterboxing <br/>
(www.letterboxing.org) is a phenomenon similar to geocaching in that <br/>
a player takes directions from a web site and uses those directions <br/>
to find a hidden object. In letterboxing, the directions come in the <br/>
form of a riddle and the hidden object is a stamp which the finder <br/>
can use to stamp a piece of paper to prove that he has visited the <br/>
site. The web site showed the location of at least two letterboxes <br/>
in parks. The parks have been notified, but the Service has not yet <br/>
contacted the webmaster or game managers. The Degree Confluence <br/>
Project (www.confluence.org) is another web-based activity where <br/>
people try to visit various latitude and longitude integer degree <br/>
intersections and report their findings on the web site. In this <br/>
case, however, no objects are placed in the ground, and there are no <br/>
apparent regulatory violations in areas where cross-country travel <br/>
is allowed or where the confluence is not on a protected site. There <br/>
has been no attempt to contact the project organizers. [Mike Butler, <br/>
SA, OLYM]------<br/>
<br/>
Note that Geocaching and I assume by association letterboxing are <br/>
described as illegal. This is from 2001 but says that the webmaster <br/>
had not been contacted at that time. Perhaps some group needs to be <br/>
formed to lobby the NPS on our behalf. This is from the "Division of <br/>
Ranger Activities" and I would assume they merely respond to <br/>
official policy interpreting in the what ever way leads to the least <br/>
change or resistance. I don't believe this ever made it above low <br/>
level policy wonks, I think we need to ask them as a group to <br/>
provide us with an official statement from the Department of the <br/>
Interior (Which oversees the NPS and the Director who is Fran <br/>
Mainella her address is; Interior Bldng, room 3104, 1849 C St NW, <br/>
Washington DC 20240) regarding the activity then we have something <br/>
to use to begin lobbying the NPS to change it's policies. I know a <br/>
government official intimately involved with the NPS who could get a <br/>
signed lifer from Ms Mainella outlining their stance on <br/>
Letterboxing, however we have no organizational structure and <br/>
therefore no representatives that speak for the group as a whole, <br/>
NOR AM I PROPOSING THAT ONE BE FORMED, I would hate to see this turn <br/>
into anything other than an informal association of like minded <br/>
individuals, but perhaps the request should come from the webmaster <br/>
of LBNA, I'd be happy to assist.<br/>

pertinent section in a book in the hands of a Park Ranger at Chaco Canyon. The <br/>
section refers to abandoned property, exactly what the NPS considers geocaches and <br/>
letterboxes. Funhog<br/>
