45th Parallel Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
First, take the freeway south to the Equator exit. Take a left and then another left. From the Equator, <br/>
start walking toward the North Pole. When you are exactly half-way there, you'll come to a place <br/>
worth stopping, at a street intersection overlooking a golden valley with a park way off to your left.  <br/>
<br/>
Sitting on the boulder here, look back where you walked from. Just 30 paces away to the southwest <br/>
you'll see three tree trunks which come together right next to where the letterbox is hidden behind a <br/>
rock. <br/>
<br/>
As this is an urban location, please camouflage the box well when you are putting it back in its hiding <br/>
place, so that it will remain completely hidden from passersby and curious neighbors. <br/>

We were so proud we figured out one of our hardest clues yet and even <br/>
more sure we had the right spot.  Guess we will just have to look <br/>
again when we are back up there next spring.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for checking on it.<br/>
