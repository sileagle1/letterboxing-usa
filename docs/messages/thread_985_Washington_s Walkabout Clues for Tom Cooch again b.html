<br/>
It came through just the same as before. I can't figure out why my <br/>
browser does with some people's e-mails and not with others.<br/>
<br/>
For me to be sure of getting it, you would need to put a hard <br/>
carriage turn after each sentence, i.e. make each sentence a separate <br/>
paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't have time to do this, Jay Drew said he would be sending <br/>
me hard copy of your clues and I will just type in the missing parts <br/>
at my end.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, Tom! How's that Maine tan? The Walkabout clues went postal and <br/>
should be arriving soon. Got me thinking about "Walkabout." Sounds <br/>
kinda Aussie, what? Around WWII, there was an Australian Navy ship in <br/>
repair at Narragansett Bay (Quonset Point, I think), and the Captain <br/>
was worried that his boys were getting a little restless (and perhaps <br/>
the mayor of Warwick was worried about the local gals' virtue). So, <br/>
the ozzie navy crew went up into the northwest corner of nowhere and <br/>
built that wonderful 8 mile loop trail (and word has it that the <br/>
locals --including the ladies -- really took them in during the <br/>
project). Sounds kind of like Jack Aubrey and his cricket matches, <br/>
doesn't it?<br/>
