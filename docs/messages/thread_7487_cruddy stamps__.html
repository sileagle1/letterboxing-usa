                    <div class="plaintext-content">Y'know, the reason it's not okay to point out which stamps are cruddy is <br/>
that people who make them may have put just as much effort into them as <br/>
someone who is better at it and has nice ones just litterally fall from <br/>
their fingertips.  It's not about the fact being true (in YOUR OPINION, I <br/>
might add), it's about the fact that you JUDGED these people's creative <br/>
efforts, dismissed a whole CITY's worth of carvings, and posted it on a <br/>
PUBLIC LIST, which may just cause some who are less secure in their carving <br/>
to leave.  (Which, of course, equals less boxes for all of us, "crappy <br/>
stamps" or not.)<br/>
<br/>
You are cordially invited to NOT look for my boxes.  I'd hate to think my <br/>
efforts were being judged like this.<br/>
<br/>
(incidentally, my stamps mostly rock. I have references and I'm a long-time <br/>
carver.  It's my hikes that suck and are improving.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
oh!  And, p.s.:  My Denny Creek series was carved with the eraser of a <br/>
pencil and a sharp stick.  You're dually disinvited from those, since those <br/>
really do suck -- it's the story of how they were carved (and the kick-ass <br/>
hike) that make those fun.  Can't expect you to understand that, though.<br/>

&gt;And finally, while I never pointed out pricisely which stamps I<br/>
&gt;thought were cruddy (while it's okay to point out particularly<br/>
&gt;well-done stamps, the opposite never seems to be the case),<br/>
&gt;many cruddy stamps do exist in the Seattle area.<br/>
