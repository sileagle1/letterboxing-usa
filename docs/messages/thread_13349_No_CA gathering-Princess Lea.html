                    <div class="plaintext-content">You are so right!! I think we need to saturate the potentially fertile San <br/>
Francisco/East Bay area with stamps. My ideas for the gathering site include but <br/>
are not limited to: Golden Gate Park, Lafayette Reservoir or Briones Park. <br/>
You probably have other great ideas What do your think?<br/>
<br/>
I would LOVE some planning committee help from you! We could make this  <br/>
gathering one for the book (or journals!) Do you really think Amanda from Seattle <br/>
could be here? If we plan it late enough in the year, maybe she could get Ryan <br/>
there too!! Wouldn't THAT be something!?<br/>
<br/>
I've had suggestions of the weekend of September 6th and 7th. Does that work <br/>
for you? <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to your suggestions and ideas!!<br/>
