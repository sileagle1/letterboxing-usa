                    <html><body>Rustypuff and I went looking for the Seahorse Letterbox this morning on the way to Freeport.  We are sorry to report that while it was in place, it was not quite intact, and far from dry.  In fact, the log book was saturated, and many of the stamps have been obliterated.  The container top is broken.  Since it was far too wet to stamp into, and since we know we'll be seeing Leader of the Pack at the January 18th gathering at Moose Hill, we took the liberty of removing the box.  We will dry out the log book as best we can and deliver it and the stamp to Carolyn on the 18th.
<br/>
<br/>It's a shame the log book was damaged.  Judging from the entries that were readable, it was a popular location and everyone enjoyed their visits.

<br/>PS: We also attempted to find the box at Nubble Light in York, but the clue landmarks were buried under several inches of snow, so we were not successful.  </body></html>
