box name:  Quinault Rain Forest<br/>
location: Maple Glade Rain Forest Trail, Olympic National Park, WA<br/>
nearest town: Quinault<br/>
county: Gray's Harbor<br/>
trail: easy  clues: easy (family-suitable on both counts)<br/>
<br/>
 From highway 101 in either direction through Olympic National Park, <br/>
watch for signs for the Quinault Rain Forest (roughly 45 miles north of <br/>
Aberdeen and 45 - 60 minutes south of Forks).  Turn onto the SOUTH SHORE <br/>
road (North shore will also lead you there, but is roughly 26 miles <br/>
longer, around a scenic loop.)<br/>
<br/>
Park across from the Quinault Ranger Station in the Maple Glade Rain <br/>
Forest parking lot.  There is a day-use permit required, available at <br/>
the informational kiosk at the trailhead for a whopping $3 (which goes <br/>
to maintain trails, so it's worth it.).<br/>
<br/>
Find the trailhead kiosk and start up the Interpretive Trail.  (.5 miles <br/>
long, very little elevation gain/lost.  Good for kids.)  Take the left <br/>
fork and go past the huge Douglas Fir.  Continue down the Interpretive <br/>
Trail -- it breaks off into the Quinault Loop Trail in two separate <br/>
places.  Follow the signs for the Interpretive Trail.  (For a side-stop, <br/>
though, if you take a left at the first branching of the IT and the QT, <br/>
there is an amazing bridge over a two-cupped waterfall that's stunning, <br/>
and not too far out of the way -- less than a tenth of a mile, easily.)<br/>
<br/>
After the placque about the causes of tree death in the forest (the one <br/>
that discusses wind damage), the trail goes downhill.  At one point, the <br/>
path ahead seems to be blocked by a strange mass of trees.  The "nurse <br/>
log" has nearly rotted away to the left, and the path follows around <br/>
this "tree on stilts".  About ten steps down, on the right, is a wooden <br/>
bench, and another five steps is a placquard about what a nurse log is. <br/>
  Read up on your natural history and go back to the skinny tree on the end.<br/>
<br/>
 From this tree, take ten steps BACK the way you came.  To your left is <br/>
a small path that goes over to the huge tree that's grown from the same <br/>
nurse log as the weird skinny tree.<br/>
<br/>
At its base is an open cubby within the roots.  Poke in it with a stick <br/>
to make sure nothing will bite you, and then find the letterbox on the <br/>
left side of the cubby, under some bark and twigs.<br/>
<br/>
This is a well-traveled trail -- please take caution in removing the box <br/>
and returning it, and make sure it's well hidden. (And all the usual <br/>
precautions apply.)<br/>
