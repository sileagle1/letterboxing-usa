I'd have to agree with this post. If you don't like what a certain <br/>
box is about, then just don't go to it. If it's a HH, just don't pick <br/>
it up. No one's forcing you to do it...unless maybe the devil is. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned this earlier, but I'm thinkin' maybe it got lost in all <br/>
this witchcraft stuff so I'll ask again. Does anyone have any <br/>
additional info on the Serendipity's Sister box in DE? Here are the <br/>
clues http://www.confessionsofdecember.com/lbna/clues/sister.asp. I <br/>
just can't figure out where to begin. I know "the first county in the <br/>
first state" and I think I know the "shared last name with the <br/>
governor". Any hints or additional clues would really be appreciated.<br/>

PS-I'm a lesbian. Talk about stirrin' things up. LOL<br/>
I just think it shows what a wide range of people are attracted to <br/>
this hobby/sport. I think it's a great thing! :)<br/>
