DailyNews: Private Detectives Begin Arriving in Virginia<br/>
<br/>
By Polly Perkins<br/>

for the Chronicle<br/>
<br/>
July 23, 1935<br/>
<br/>
Private detectives from around the country, and indeed around the world, have begun arriving in Virginia in hopes of solving who killed Mr. Boddy at the product branding convention. They made a strong impression arriving on last night's train:<br/>
<br/>
Colombo - by Jan of Team Little Dog<br/>
<br/>
Sherlock - by Chuck Straub<br/>
<br/>
Pink Panther and Inspector Clouseau - by Penguin Patrol<br/>
<br/>
CSI traveling event - by Warrior Woman (I have it on good authority that the CSI team has their own little mystery to solve.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
"How do you feel about that Nick, all these private dicks, showing up on the trains into town. Worried about your turf?" <br/>
<br/>
"Why should I talk to you Polly?"<br/>
<br/>
"Maybe because of the half drunk bottle of Glenmorangie scotch on your desk?"<br/>
<br/>
"Oh yeah. That. Well whadda I care 'bout a buncha prima donna mind twisters. The corporate fat cats are all peein' in their pants that this will ruin their million dollar product brands. They're hirin' any dick that walks."<br/>
<br/>
-----<br/>
<br/>
Nick Danger, our own local, famous, private detective, hired by the Boddy family to assist the police, says that we can use all the help that is available. <br/>
<br/>
------<br/>
<br/>
"Heck, there are so many clues, so many people to interview because of the convention, We probably needed the help anyway."<br/>
<br/>
"Nick, can you tell me who the suspects are so far." <br/>
<br/>
"Don't push your luck Polly."<br/>
<br/>
"pssst, pssst, pssst" <br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, well. When you put it that way."<br/>
<br/>
-----<br/>
<br/>
Anonymous sources in the investigation confirm the following suspects and clues are already making an impression:<br/>
