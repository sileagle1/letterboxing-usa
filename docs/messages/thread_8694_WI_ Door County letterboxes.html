Long time no write.  Those Door Co. letterboxes<br/>
are/were mine for the most part, and I've been a busy<br/>
busy man this past year and haven't had a chance to<br/>
replace and repair any.  To the best of my knowledge,<br/>
the letterboxes at Cave Point, Cana Island, Mink<br/>
River, and Sturgeon Bay Canal Light are still there. <br/>
The others were all lost or removed and not yet<br/>
replaced.  If anyone does go looking for them, I'd<br/>
welcome a report on their condition.  If any new boxes<br/>
should happen to get placed, well, so much the better<br/>
as well.<br/>
Happy letterboxing,<br/>
Steven<br/>

Mink River remains my favorite box, especially if the <br/>
paddling concession is closed :-)<br/>
<br/>
Hope its still there (it was in '99), set aside some time<br/>
for it ...<br/>
