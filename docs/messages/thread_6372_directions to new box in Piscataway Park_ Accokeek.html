Nearest town: Accokeek, Maryland<br/>
State: Maryland<br/>
County: Prince George's County<br/>
Placed: July 21, 2002<br/>
Directions: From town center Accokeek, Maryland (B &amp; J Carryout)<br/>
travel 3 miles on Bryan Point Road until a "hidden entrance" sign is<br/>
observed. Take the next right where you will see a National Park<br/>
Service sign that says "Piscataway Park - Accokeek Creek". The sign<br/>
warns that the park is only open during daylight and to leave your<br/>
martini's behind. Early birds may find the gate locked but you can<br/>
park on the side of the road and walk, it's not too far. Procede to<br/>
the parking area. A trail head is on the right. The trail turns into a<br/>
boardwalk over the marshes and George Washington's Mt. Vernon is<br/>
observed directly across the Potomac River. Follow the boardwalk to<br/>
the end and then turn right (south). Follow the woods line about 110<br/>
paces until you see a split tree with 4 forks. (You are now at WGS 84<br/>
coordinate system 34 degrees 40.694' N, 77 degrees 03.100' W). About<br/>
40 ft from this tree in direction WNW is a large ancient looking tulip<br/>
poplar. The letterbox is in the fork of the large tulip poplar.<br/>
