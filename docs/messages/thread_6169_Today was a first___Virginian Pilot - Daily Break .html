<br/>
Yes, if you meet a fellow letterboxer it's great to be<br/>
able to exchange stamps...it's an extra nice added<br/>
surprise.  Sometimes, though, you meet them on the<br/>
trail and don't even realize it. :o) <br/>
<br/>
Yes, there is a definite lack of letterboxes in the<br/>
central and western parts of PA.  I'll be on the<br/>
lookout for your boxes! <br/>
