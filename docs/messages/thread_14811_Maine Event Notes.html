<br/>
Leaving the Beach for the day is okay...be sure to ask for a pass on <br/>
the way out or you may be charged $3.50 again.  I mention this so <br/>
that you may leave for local letterboxes already out there:) !!!<br/>
<br/>
I have set up a small letterbox adventure for the day of the event! <br/>
And only for Saturday. See me for the directions at the meeting place <br/>
mentioned by Deb.<br/>
<br/>
The weather does not look like sun but possible rain.  Does someone <br/>
have a tarp to set up?<br/>
<br/>
Bring lots of bug spray!!!  I mean it...the mosquitoes and horseflies <br/>
are horrible!  <br/>
<br/>
I have seen pets here. However, these may have been the clammers dogs.<br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to meeting everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I hope to plant another box "nearby" should time allow.<br/>
