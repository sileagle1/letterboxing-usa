Thanks for letting me know how my toad is doing. He was silent for a long time after I set him free, and I'm glad he is getting to travel now. I like Silent Doug's idea of taking him to foreign soil and stamping in, but then bringing him back to the US. I think he'd be happiest hitching around the United States. He only speaks english toadese and would be afraid on his own in a foreign land. <br/>
<br/>
Have a safe and fun trip!!<br/>

If you've been looking at the LB talk list recently, you might have guessed that my Post #37258 concerns your traveling toad. <br/>
<br/>
Karen and I are going to Cancun, Mexico in a couple of weeks, and we were thinking about dropping the toad off in the Chili Peppers LB. My concern (expressed in the post) is that the Chili Pepper clues only seem to appear on the old LB site, and not on the new site. I'm afraid that if we leave the toad there, he may never be found by anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
I liked Silent Doug's answer (Post # 37261) to my questions, and I wanted to run it by you. I'm now thinking about taking the toad with us to stamp into the Chili Peppers box (if it's still there), but than bringing him back to leave in a US box, where he's more likely to continue his travels. What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
You can reply to me at this address, or leave a message on the LB site.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I think we were only the 5th stamp in the TT logbook - it looks like the toad made it back to Virginia pretty quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Happy new year!!!!<br/>
