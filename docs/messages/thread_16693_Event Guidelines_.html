<br/>
Are there any guidelines as to what can be considered an "Event"?  <br/>
Does it need to include "Day of" boxes, or is only an event stamp <br/>
required?<br/>
<br/>
I'd appreciate any suggestions or opinions since I am relatively new <br/>
to letterboxing.<br/>

Not really.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Does it need to include "Day of" boxes, or is only an event stamp <br/>
&gt; required?<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what you mean by "Day of" boxes, but even a group of a <br/>
few letterboxers meeting together could be considered an event.  I <br/>
created an "event stamp" for my AT hike that was good only while I <br/>
was on the trail.  A traveling event, I guess you could say, <br/>
stretched out for over five months.  =)<br/>
<br/>
One event I tried planning in Seattle a couple of years back had a <br/>
whopping five people show up.  But man, it was a high quality event.  <br/>
Even if I did show up an hour late.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
But if there's a group of two or more letterboxers and an event <br/>
stamp, I'd call it an event.<br/>
