to letterboxing was bad ---- I'm afraid it's going to get worse.<br/>
Let me announce to you all the imminent arrival of<br/>
LetterboxingCentral.Com. For those of you who do not immediately<br/>
throw rocks and bottles let me say that it is not my intent to<br/>
compete with anyone. Any and all information which is gathered by<br/>
this site is freely available and I invite you to either place it<br/>
on your own site or link to it as you see fit.<br/>
<br/>
It is our belief that although letterboxing.org and others do an<br/>
admirable job at promotining letterboxing itself, there is a<br/>
lot of room to present many other aspects of this sport/hobby.<br/>
Our intent is to be a gateway to all of the elements that make up<br/>
this activity. I hope we do it well and that we offer something of<br/>
value to the letterboxing community.<br/>
<br/>
We will be actively displaying links to sites which benefit the<br/>
sport and will undoubtedly link to yours. We hope you find <br/>
value in our site to warrant a link of your own. We will be On-Line<br/>
by June 24. <br/>
