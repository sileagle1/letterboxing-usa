Comments:  This is a nice little park adjacent to Interstate 5.  It <br/>
is an excellent location to take a break from a long stretch of road <br/>
travel.  Bring a picnic and enjoy the nice playground and short <br/>
little trail system after you've found the letterbox.  This <br/>
letterbox may be difficult to reach or even inaccessible during <br/>
winter months or when there is a great amount of snow accumulation <br/>
in the area.  It's an awesome location for a hot summer day since <br/>
this park is quite cool when it's rather hot at lower elevations!<br/>
<br/>
Directions to City Park, Mt. Shasta City:  Take I-5 Exit 740 (Mt <br/>
Shasta City) and head East.  This road is N. Mt Shasta Blvd and will <br/>
quickly veer South.  Turn right (or West) on Nixon Rd, cross <br/>
railroad tracks and take the first right into City Park.  Park near <br/>
the playground.    <br/>
<br/>
Clues:  From the Headwaters of the Sacramento River, head down the <br/>
wooden steps, cross the arched footbridge.  Continue along the <br/>
trail, crossing a flat footbridge and then a half-log bridge.  Just <br/>
left of the W tip of this bridge is a tree stump.  What you seek is <br/>
hidden behind it &amp; under a rock.  Please re-hide it well when you're <br/>
through as this is a heavily used area plus it receives incredible <br/>
amounts of snow in the winter and may flood during the early Spring <br/>
months as the snow melts off of Mt Shasta.  <br/>
<br/>
Note:  It is incredible to imagine that this little spring births <br/>
the raging waters of the mighty Sacramento River.  Remember this <br/>
image if you continue South to Redding to seek the Riverside Rest <br/>
letterbox along the banks of the Sacramento River!!! <br/>
