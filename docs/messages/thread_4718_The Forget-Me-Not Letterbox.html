					Pistapaug Mt., Durham, CT   <br/>
<br/>
       A single letterbox placed on 3-17-02 by the Gal Pals on Pistapaug<br/>
Mountain in Durham,  CT.        .<br/>
<br/>
    Difficulty:  A steep hike up the mountain. Take a few breaks along the<br/>
way if you get tired. It will take<br/>
          you  10-15 minutes to go up. Once up, it is an easy and<br/>
picturesque hike. Bring  water and snacks  <br/>
          and sit a spell - the view is fantastic. Look for Oma's<br/>
messengers- red tailed hawks and turkey <br/>
          vultures. We have even seen a bald eagle over the resevoir. The<br/>
road below is great for birding.<br/>
          Species seen here are Worm eating warbler, Common yellow throated<br/>
warblers, Red eyed vireo,       <br/>
  	Scarlet tanager, Barred owl, Wood duck, Mergansers, and Great blue<br/>
heron. <br/>
            The trip up and back should be approximately 1-1 1/2 hours. (2<br/>
mile hike)<br/>
<br/>
    Directions: From Durham Center, travel south on RT17 toward Northford.<br/>
Go approximately 2 and 1/2       	miles until you come to Howd Rd. on<br/>
your right. Travel on Howd Rd. for approximately 2 miles and 	look for a<br/>
pull off on your left by the concrete blocks . If you come to concrete<br/>
blocks on your right, turn  	around, you have gone too far. The entrance<br/>
to the Pistapaug Mountain Trail is right behind the   <br/>
            concrete blocks. Look for the blue blazed trail as you will be<br/>
following it all the way up.  When the trail       <br/>
            forks, keep following the blue blazes. This takes you along the<br/>
ridge line. Eventually, you will see an<br/>
            unblazed "path" off to your right and down the small slope to<br/>
the vistas. Be careful when going down<br/>
            as the rocks are often loose and the footing questionable. We<br/>
made it just fine and so will you ! Just 	go slowly. ( Remember that<br/>
we are the "older" kids -some of us will never see 50 again  :D )<br/>
            Once you have enjoyed a snack and the views, retrace your steps<br/>
back up to the blue blazed trail.<br/>
             Follow the blue blazed trail to where the path begins to head<br/>
southeast and away from the vistas. 	You will spot a beech tree with<br/>
initials carved into it . ( poor tree!) From the beech tree and<br/>
facing the southward trail, go 50 steps (25 paces) into the woods at 220<br/>
degrees to a 4 sister 	oak tree on a hillock. You will find the<br/>
Forget-Me-Not Letterbox nearby under a pile of 	stones.  <br/>
                After stamping in, retrace your hike along the blue blazed<br/>
trail the way you came. (You could follow 	the blue blaze trail in the<br/>
southward direction. It takes you down to RT. 17 in Durham near Stagecoach <br/>
            Rd. You would then either return back up the mountain or  you<br/>
could  park another car there 	and drive 	back to the other end from<br/>
whence you came.  There is a diagram of this trail in the Short Nature<br/>
Hikes in Connecticut book. We hope you enjoy the hike !<br/>
<br/>
	ps.   Forget-Me-Nots were some of Oma's favorite flowers. She<br/>
planted many along the brook in 	       West Simsbury, CT.<br/>
