                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is not strictly letterboxing related but I'm hoping that some <br/>
of you fellow letterboxers out there may be able to help me.<br/>
<br/>
I discovered Letterboxing about a year ago and have been firmly <br/>
hooked since! It's enabled me to enjoy the countryside and discover <br/>
new places in the Cincinnati area of Ohio, having lots of fun at the <br/>
same time. In August, however, our family is returning to England <br/>
(from whence we came 2 1/2 years ago) - so I am hoping to visit <br/>
Dartmoor and further my letterboxing exploits over there.<br/>
<br/>
Before we say farewell to the USA, we are planning a road trip <br/>
vacation from Cincinnati, Ohio to Yellowstone National Park, mostly <br/>
along the I-90, and then going south to Rocky Mountains NP and <br/>
returning to Cincinnati mostly along the I-70. We'll be spending <br/>
about 4 days on the road in each direction. What I'm after is any <br/>
recommendations or suggestions of places to visit or drive through <br/>
en route which will give us a 'flavor of America'. What do people <br/>
consider the 'Highlights' that a visiting Brit should not miss?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help<br/>

Wow,   <br/>
<br/>
we just visited Nebraska, SD &amp; Wyoming last may there are some neat things to <br/>
see between Illinois and wy.<br/>
<br/>
Snce you asked:<br/>
<br/>
.... if you drive though Illinois along I-70 stop in Green Up for a short <br/>
visit to Lincoln's father's home (letterbox).  There is is a living working farm <br/>
and it is a neat place to visit in the Summer!<br/>
<br/>
For another Lincoln site ... You could stop in Vandalia,the old state capitol <br/>
for a visit,  ... but it might not be worth your while unless there is a fair <br/>
or festival that weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Stop in Collinsville to visit the Cahokia Mounds (letterbox) ancient native <br/>
American site.  This is interesting without a letterbox!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Then take 255 to 270 west and follow  rte 3 north to the New Lewis and Clark <br/>
museum.  VERY INTERESTING!  Pick up a brochure while there because just a <br/>
little farther north in Alton there will be a few historic sites and antique shops <br/>
(THE location of the Lincoln-Douglas Slavery Debates...the home of Alton's <br/>
Gentle Giant .. Underground railroad tours  but they have to be pre-scheduled, <br/>
the new Lock &amp; Dam 26 Museum).  If you have kids with you...follow the river <br/>
road and visit the Raging Rivers Water Park for a fun wet time. (quick letterbox <br/>
in the area)  Pere Marquette state park is also located there ...When you <br/>
pass through Grafton ... a must place to eat is the FIN FIN INN .  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you plan to travel back down to Interstate 70 .<br/>
Between, Lebanon, IL and St. Louis, MO there are around 30 Letterboxes that <br/>
might be of interest to you.  Some are just stops along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Stop at the Forest Park St. Louis Zoo if you wish.  (letterboxes) It is <br/>
always worth the trip.... Forest Park also boasts a Science Center, History Museum, <br/>
Art Museum etc.<br/>
<br/>
For a few excursions head south to Ironton Missouri area to visit Elephant <br/>
Rock and the Johnston Shut-ins.  Depending on when you will be there you might <br/>
be in time for a civil war reenactment at Pilot Knob.<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to continue on I-70.   Stop at the Osage Fort (commanded by <br/>
Meriweather Lewis) and stop in Independence MO to visit the Harry S. Truman <br/>
sites.<br/>
(letterboxes in the area)<br/>
<br/>
Head North at Kansas City and Stop in Omaha NEb for the Doorly Zoo, and a few <br/>
letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
If you plan on going into SD ...stop at Mitchell (Letterbox) to visit the <br/>
corn palace and an archeological native Indian village.  Then , of course, drive <br/>
west on the only interstate: there are many attractions along the way.  You <br/>
won't want to miss the Badlands , Mount Rushmore, Crazy Horse Mt  or Custer's <br/>
Nature Preserve.   There will be more than you can fit in.  WE had planted a <br/>
micro box at the Dinosaur Park but it fell victim about 3 months ago.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course in WY Devil's Tower is worthwhile &amp; Yellow Stone.<br/>
<br/>
If you plan on going through Nebraska don't miss the Platt River Museum  .... <br/>
it looks like a huge truss bridge across the interstate.  Other stops along <br/>
that highway include the Pony Express,  the Oregon trail, CourtHouse &amp; Jail <br/>
Rock , Chimney Rock  &amp; CarHenge (a must stop if you are within 25 miles of <br/>
it...just to get a picture and say you were there)<br/>
<br/>
More information than you will ever need!!!!<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, you got quite the travel guide there from Mohmers.  That's great!<br/>
<br/>
I live close to Yellowstone, so let me give a few recommendations here as<br/>
well.  While you are in Yellowstone country, make sure that you take some<br/>
time to also visit Grand Teton NP, which is right by Yellowstone.  There is<br/>
beautiful country out there, most of which wasn't burned like Yellostone in<br/>
the fires a while back.  I just did a fairly easy hike last week around<br/>
Jenny Lake up to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point.  It wasn't too<br/>
strenuous, and I really enjoyed the scenery.  Jackson, right outside of<br/>
Grand Teton, is a fun little town for shopping, galleries, restaurants.  If<br/>
you are into good music there is the Grand Teton Music Festival in Jackson<br/>
(actually Teton Village-owned by Jackson).  They bring in prominent<br/>
classical or jazz musicians from all around the country who give their<br/>
summers up for playing in the orchestra.  They always put on a wonderful<br/>
concert.  The last one I went to was with the gold medalist from the Van<br/>
Cliburn (sp?) piano competition.  If you go on Friday night, you can get 1/2<br/>
price tickets for the last two rows, but the hall is small enough that it<br/>
doesn't matter if you are on the first or last row.<br/>
<br/>
Let me give you one recommendation if you are boxing along the way.  Make<br/>
sure that you check for boxes in all the surrounding states-ID, WY, MT, etc.<br/>
People don't realize that Yellowstone actually covers area in all of those<br/>
states.  Personally, I have planted a few boxes in areas around there that<br/>
wouldn't show up if you are just looking for the name "Yellowstone" (since<br/>
they aren't in the park) and would love to have someone look them up (hint,<br/>
hint :)  or to bump into someone for an exchange.  Let me know your<br/>
approximate travel dates because I have been planning on getting up to West<br/>
Yellowstone or Jackson to make some more plants, but haven't had a spare<br/>
moment.  If I know you are coming, I may be able to get up a little more<br/>
quickly.<br/>

It will be a bit out of your way if you are just going to Denver as I<br/>
suspect, but it will be worth your time to make a side trip down to<br/>
Southwest Colorado for some time in Mesa Verde National Park.  They have<br/>
some wonderful Native American cliff dwellings that are fascinating.  If you<br/>
want to continue out of your way, Arches National Park and Canyonlands NP<br/>
are both not too far from there.  They are wonderful areas.<br/>
