<br/>
A wonderfully windy sunny spring day found me with two new stamps in<br/>
my logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Last week Funhog visited Nebraska and left behind some of her handiwork.<br/>
<br/>
Here are my logs, which can also be read at the Letterboxing Nebraska<br/>
web site at http://interbug.com/letterboxing<br/>
<br/>
Heartland Letterbox, Chalco Hills, Omaha, Nebraska<br/>
March 31, 2003<br/>
Found by Scott, Roxanne and Emily on a beautiful, but windy, spring<br/>
afternoon. I have a Geocache close to this park as was just there last<br/>
week doing some cache maintenance. We might have just missed each<br/>
other. Emily stamped in with a Barbie stamp. Thanks for the hide, Funhog! <br/>
<br/>
Mandan Heron Letterbox, Mandan Park, Omaha, Nebraska<br/>
March 31, 2003<br/>
Found by Scott and Roxanne. We were the first to this letterbox. The<br/>
hike was fun, but we think Roxanne left her sunglasses at the nest, so<br/>
back we go tomorrow morning to see if they are there. I would strongly<br/>
caution against seeking this letterbox at night, as there are some<br/>
fatal dropoffs and washouts along the way. This letterbox was my first<br/>
in which I used colored markers rather than a solid inkpad for the<br/>
stamp. Wow, what a stamp! Thanks for the hide Funhog! <br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
