  First, thanks, Wes, for the new tools. I was able to add our list <br/>
of boxes without trouble. If I can do it...<br/>
<br/>
  Here's my dumb question. Will we "losing" the www.letterboxing.org <br/>
web address? Shall I put the new website address on the information <br/>
sheets I put in my boxes? <br/>
(http://letterboxing.wesgarrison.us/default.asp) I assume the answer <br/>
is yes, but I am not a techie.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, I was playing with the new site and the Talk link doesn't seem <br/>
to work. <br/>

<br/>
dot-wesgarrison will be temporary during the sure-to-be-confusing <br/>
transition time. We think maybe a month? Then we'll point the "real" <br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org domain to the new site and the old one <br/>
will be history.<br/>
<br/>
The web hosts will keep the old site up to date during this <br/>
transition, until we're sure that no boxes get left behind and that <br/>
all minor bugs are worked out.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much to everyone who has already gone on. I'm sure Wes has <br/>
a few more gray hairs tonight!<br/>
