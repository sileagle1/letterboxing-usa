                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had been hearing a lot of good things about the Headless Hunters <br/>
boxes  on the Cape and decided to check them out for ourselves . We <br/>
started at his  new Whydah box at the Marconi site in Wellfleet . <br/>
Excellent work ! We knew at this point that we were in for a  <br/>
treat . Oh ! Will , you might want to check on this box  for reasons <br/>
I won't divulge here . We spent the  rest of the day traveling about <br/>
the Cape finding all of his boxes , plus a few  more . <br/>
<br/>
For a young man who relies on his bicycle to get around,the <br/>
Headless Hunter has done a remarkable  job on these boxes . Great <br/>
stamps , ingenious hiding spots and some  great historical info ( <br/>
who knew you could take an airplane to the drive - in  ? ) ! We are <br/>
anticipating the day he will obtain the means of spreading his  boxes <br/>
over the whole of New England . If this is the future of <br/>
letterboxing ,  then I would say things are in good hands .<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Will  !!<br/>

I concur!  Every one of Will's boxes is a treasure.  As I wrote him <br/>
privately after my October Cape Cod weekend, his boxes are the <br/>
creme de la creme of letterboxing!  I plan on another Cape visit in <br/>
October 2004 and sure hope there are lots more great Headless <br/>
Hunter boxes to find!<br/>
<br/>
I didn't know he got around by bike.  In that case, the Scargo <br/>
Tower letterbox is even more impressive--biking up that hill can't <br/>
be easy!<br/>

P.S.  Will there be an October 2004 Cape gathering?  If so, I <br/>
hope it is announced many months in advance, as I will be <br/>
booking a Wellfleet cottage in February or March.<br/>
