A belated thanks to all the official organizers (Chuck &amp; Molly, <br/>
Chickabirdie, The Needeeps, Teach &amp; Preach) and numerous other <br/>
volunteers  who made the Mansfield Monster Mash such a success.  We <br/>
traveled from Wisconsin to the "hub" of US letterboxing and were not <br/>
disappointed.  Everyone at the event on Saturday was very friendly <br/>
and we enjoyed meeting so many of you and doing exchanges.  We ended <br/>
up with a total of 91 new exchanges, mostly at the gathering, but a <br/>
few out on the trails in the days following the event.<br/>
<br/>
Since our time was limited, we had to choose whether to pursue only <br/>
the Monsters, or also look for other boxes on the same trails.  We <br/>
elected to try to find as many boxes that were on the trails we were <br/>
hiking, and really appreciated that the Monster clues included a <br/>
reference to other boxes in the area.  However this approach did mean <br/>
we were juggling 2 or 3 sets of clues at the same time - which did <br/>
get somewhat confusing!<br/>
<br/>
The Mansfield area certainly has lots of neat hiking trails tucked <br/>
into residential areas. We enjoyed the rocky terrain, streams &amp; <br/>
lakes.  The area is actually somewhat similar to the glacial hiking <br/>
areas in Wisconsin.  However we were challenged to actually FIND the <br/>
almost hidden trailheads and often went driving back &amp; forth a bit.  <br/>
(Of course it didn't help that we sometimes came from a different <br/>
highway and were looking left when we should have been looking <br/>
right!)  We always managed to find the spot and the maps provided at <br/>
the Gathering proved invaluable.<br/>
<br/>
We enjoyed four days of hiking and boxing and managed to find 79 <br/>
monster boxes (Thanks to the Monster Makers for a fantastic variety <br/>
of stamps!) and 62 other boxes.  This included finding our 400th box <br/>
(Chuck's "Jumbo" box in his clever Elephant Safari series).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for making us feel welcome and for hosting such a great <br/>
event!<br/>
