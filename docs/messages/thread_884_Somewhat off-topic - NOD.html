<br/>
Your posting didn't seem off the topic of letterboxing at all. I <br/>
particularly like the orienteering aspect of letterboxing - the more <br/>
degree readings in the clues, the better I like them.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't participated in any orienteering events, but have managed <br/>
to get myself on a mailing list of the Green Mountain Orienteering <br/>
Club. They have a series of courses in Montpelier this Saturday and I <br/>
am sorely tempted to go. However, my younger son has a little league <br/>
game in the morning and my older son a lacrosse game in the <br/>
afternoon. Since I am abandoning them (and my transportation <br/>
responsibilities) the next week-end, I doubt I will be able to go <br/>
this NOD. Maybe over the summer - there are several other dates on <br/>
the GMOC flyer.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the heads-up anyway. See you soon.<br/>

<br/>
I've been pondering for a couple of days whether to post this or not, then I decided it made sense, so here goes...<br/>
<br/>
This saturday is National Orienteering Day (NOD).  Since I was introduced to letterboxing through orienteering, I want to return the favor.  For me, the two share some of my passions: the outdoors, maps, compasses, navigation, searching, and just getting out there getting some exercise and having fun.<br/>
<br/>
NOD encompasses over 40 events nationwide geared to beginners and are designed to introduce orienterring to newbies.  go to http://www.us.orienteering.org/NOD.html#public for more info.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if is too off-topic, but truly for me, the 2 (letterboxing and orienteering) go hand-in-hand.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if naybody tried it.<br/>

Have you ever wondered about heaven and what the "entrance requirements" are? <br/>
There are many theories but you can find out for yourself what the Bible <br/>
says.  These are just a few passages that explain God's plan:<br/>
     Acts 2:36-41        Romans 10:17     Matt 10:32-33<br/>
     Romans 10:9-10   Acts 8:34-38        Acts 2:38     Romans 10:14+<br/>
     Matt 28:19-20       Mark 16:16          <br/>
     1John 4:3             Matt 10:32           1 Peter 3:21<br/>
How do you do that? These passages are good examples of how:<br/>
      Acts 2:36-38;   Romans 6:1-5;  Ephesians 2:19;  Acts 16:29-33; Acts <br/>
22:16 !!!!!<br/>
Then: Eph 2:4-5;  2 Cor 5:14-17  &amp; Romans 8:12-14; Eph 4:16<br/>
On that last day you can claim your reward: Romans 8:18; Rev 2:10<br/>
