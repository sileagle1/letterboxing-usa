Regarding the suggestion to use metal ammo boxes, I'm trying to <br/>
picture NattyBumppo using them for his urban boxes in Washington, DC, <br/>
or the person who placed a box at the Canadian border behind a <br/>
utility box. <br/>

&gt; Much of it is condensation. Also, rubbermaid style containers <br/>
&gt; generally weren't designed for outdoor use. Although in the <br/>
&gt; refrigerator and freezer they hold up a good seal, outdoors you <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; constant temperature swings. Each time as the plastic shrinks or <br/>
&gt; swells, moisture is allowed in. As far as plastic containers go, <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; high-end containers hold up better than your cheap dollar store <br/>
&gt; variety do. They're usually thicker and have a more secure seal.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Metal ammo boxes usually do an excellent job of keeping things dry. <br/>
&gt; Their major downfalls though include they can be pricey depending <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; where you are and in urban areas, they can set off a "bomb scare" <br/>
&gt; (Even though a bomb could just as easily be in a plastic <br/>
container.).<br/>

&gt; &gt; What could be more disheartening than finding a box full of water <br/>
&gt; &gt; and a soaked, ruined log?  Kudos to all for efforts to double bag <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have seen many boxes with a lot of water in them.  Many of <br/>
these <br/>
&gt; &gt; are good freezer style Rubbermaid containers that appear to be <br/>
&gt; &gt; sealed well.  How does the water get in there?  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; - Not really sealed well?<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Not closed tight?<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Temperature changes and humidity?<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Condensation?<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Do bigger boxes with lots of air allow more condensation?<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Do paper towels and paper pages attract it?<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Flooding? <br/>
&gt; &gt; - Do we have to test new boxes before planting them?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My mind imagines a body farm with letterboxes scattered about for <br/>
&gt; &gt; testing.  <br/>

How did I get dragged into this?<br/>
<br/>
I am currently buying surplus public phones and ATMs to hide <br/>
my urban boxes in.  It's a little pricey, but less stressful in DC and <br/>
NYC.<br/>
<br/>
I used to make homemade dessicant bags for some sensitive <br/>
field electronics I work with.  The silica gel crystals are available <br/>
in larger inexpensive quantities as closet/basement <br/>
dehumidifiers.  You just need to make a air-permeable sachet.  <br/>
(The teabag idea is great)<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that the silica gel holds the moisture.  It doesnt <br/>
evaporate so you get a little bag of goop in your box.  You will <br/>
need to swap them out fairly frequently.  They are quite <br/>
poisonous I am told so dispose carefully.<br/>

I don't know if it's the same kind of desiccant, but I was an <br/>
electronics tech in the Navy.  We had a desiccant that turned color <br/>
when it got too saturated.  (I as used in a piece of gear that had to <br/>
be absolutely dry.)  You could bake it in the oven for a length of <br/>
time until it turned white again and reuse it.  Might work with <br/>
yours, as well.<br/>

Interesting.  But if it was made for the Navy, it's probably $300 an <br/>
oz. <br/>
