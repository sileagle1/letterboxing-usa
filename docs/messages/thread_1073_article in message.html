Discover a little box of fun on Mt. Pisgah<br/>
<br/>

NORTHBOROUGH - What do a plastic box, a rubber stamp and a notebook all have <br/>
in common? They are all elements of a letterbox placed on Mt. Pisgah in <br/>
Northborough.<br/>
  Letterboxing is an outdoor activity that started in England in the late <br/>
1800s. It's best described as hiking with a twist. In addition to simply <br/>
following directions to reach a destination, you also must use a set of <br/>
clues to find the hidden letterbox.<br/>
  Once found, letterbox hunters stamp the notebook in the letterbox with <br/>
their personal stamp, then stamp their own notebook with the stamp in the <br/>
box. It's a fun pastime that, once you get started on, becomes very <br/>
addicting.<br/>
  The first letterbox was said to have been placed in Dartmoor, England, <br/>
where there now are over 21,000 letterboxes. The story goes that in 1854, a <br/>
gentleman on the moors placed his calling card in a bottle and left it. No <br/>
doubt he had no idea what he had started.<br/>
  Letterboxing has only been in America for a few years, but it is catching <br/>
on quickly.  Northborough is home to one of about 28 letterboxes (at last <br/>
count) in Massachusetts. It is an activity that can be enjoyed alone or with <br/>
family or friends and doesn't take a lot of special equipment. All you need <br/>
is a compass, a rubberstamp and ink pad, a small notebook, a pen and, of <br/>
course, the clues to find the letterbox.<br/>
At the present time, the majority of the clues are on the Letterboxing North <br/>
America web site at www.letterboxing.org. The locations of the boxes range <br/>
from easy, flat rambles along the seashore to more strenuous hikes through <br/>
the mountains. Clues range from the simple to the cryptic. There is a wide <br/>
variety for letterbox hunters to choose from and enjoy.<br/>
  Directions and clues for Mt. Pisgah's letterbox can be found by going to <br/>
the Letterboxing North America web site, clicking on Massachusetts on the <br/>
map and then clicking on Northborough.<br/>
    Mt. Pisgah's letterbox is called the "Mt. Pisgah Fledglings," which <br/>
reflects what is carved on the stamp in the letterbox. The notebook in the <br/>
letterbox shows that it was placed on Oct. 24, 1999, and, so far, has only <br/>
been stamped by a few people. Mt. Pisgah was named after the biblical <br/>
mountain range where Moses was shown the promised land by God. In the past, <br/>
Mt. Pisgah had been used as grazing land and for timber and was deeded to <br/>
the town in 1978.<br/>
  The climb up Mt. Pisgah is a pleasant, easy hike and the clues for finding <br/>
the letterbox are straightforward. There is a little thrill in finally <br/>
spying the outline of the humble plastic box, neatly hidden so that if you <br/>
didn't have the clues, you almost certainly would not find it.  In case it <br/>
is found by accident, there are instructions in the box explaining why it is <br/>
there so that it will not be removed.<br/>
   Like any outdoor activity, letterboxing requires that you take some <br/>
common-sense precautions against the elements. The trails along Mt. Pisgah <br/>
are well-marked and maintained, but sturdy footwear should be worn as there <br/>
are some rocky and damp patches. A good insect repellant is highly <br/>
recommended, as is a bottle of water on a hot day.<br/>
   Finally, as you follow the directions that lead you to your prize, take <br/>
some time to enjoy the beautiful surroundings. If you take children along, <br/>
consider bringing a small nature guide to help identify the plants and small <br/>
animals that you will encounter along the way. You might see deer, wild <br/>
turkeys and rabbits, and you will definitely hear the many song birds that <br/>
provide a continuous musical backdrop to your walk.  Nothing quite beats the <br/>
excitement of finding the letterbox itself, but there can be more than half <br/>
the fun.<br/>
