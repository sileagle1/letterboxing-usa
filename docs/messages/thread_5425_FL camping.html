                    <div class="plaintext-content">If by remote, you mean where there are no other people, I can suggest the <br/>
St. Francis Loop trail, which is about 5 miles west of DeLand, just across <br/>
the St. Johns River.  It's an 8-mile loop sort of in the Ocala National <br/>
Forest maintained by the Florida Trail Association.  There's a group <br/>
campground at the trailhead, and no official campsites on the trail, but <br/>
some spots where it's obvious there have been campfires.  Last time I was <br/>
out there, though, in March I think, I did notice ATV tracks - so am <br/>
guessing the rednecks too lazy to walk have discovered they can get away <br/>
with tearing up the mosses, etc.  Hontoon Island is not remote, but they do <br/>
have a primitive site scouts use sometimes - don't know if they'd care if <br/>
you used it, or camped elsewhere on the island.  It's a state park, and as <br/>
far as I know, they don't know yet I've planted 7 boxes out there.  They <br/>
have cabins and regular sites with central toilets/showers.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to plant a box out at St. Francis called the Naked Redneck - tell <br/>
you why later - got to shovel out the guest room as my mom's flying in <br/>
today.<br/>
