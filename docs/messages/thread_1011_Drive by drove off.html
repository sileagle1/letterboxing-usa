"Fort Wetheril," a drive-up minimalist letterbox, has been reported <br/>
missing/found several times, but a reliable source couldn't re-find <br/>
it this week: consider it temporarily gone.<br/>
"Purgatory Point" has been revised after vandalism. Clues on our site <br/>

Hope you're enjoying all the new letterbox activity on the list as <br/>
much as we are!<br/>

<div>Hi Jay</div>
<div>I was up along the Holyoke Ridge 
today.</div>
<div>Happily I found the Mt. Hitchcock and Bare Mountain 
boxes.</div>
<div>Try as I did I could not find the Traprock House 
box.</div>
<div>I did the one can route, forth and back. I left at 
9 am and just got back.</div>
<div>Great boxes, great sites.</div>
