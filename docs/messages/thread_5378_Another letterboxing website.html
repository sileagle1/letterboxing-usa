Just thought some of you might like to preview my letterboxing site, <br/>
which is up and running.<br/>
Nothing about North America I am afraid, but I have included some <br/>
pics of my own stamps, english style! <br/>
Loads of photos of Dartmoor and Dartmoor Ponies.<br/>
I do hope you can spend just a couple of minutes having alook. Let me <br/>
know what you think. I still have some space to use, maybe some of <br/>
you can give me an idea on what to fill the space with.<br/>
Anyway, thanks for your time, and keep up the good work in USA.<br/>
