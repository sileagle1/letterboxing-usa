Sooo...it did scare (and intrigue) us a bit when we ran into one at <br/>
the DrewClan's Wilikos Village letterbox at Sugarloaf Ridge State <br/>
Park in Santa Rosa.  We successfully got the box, taking care not to <br/>
stick hands in dark holes, and then noticed the snake not a foot <br/>
from the hiding place as we were putting the box back.  I'm sure he <br/>
was there when I was climbing down off the trail into the little pit <br/>
that makes up the hiding spot!  Eek!  We're keeping our eyes <br/>
especially peeled from now on!<br/>
<br/>
All of the Sugarloaf boxes are wonderful (and accounted for).  Such <br/>
a great park!  We enjoyed noticing the amazing increase in Jay's (I <br/>
assume it was Jay) carving skills from 2001 to 2003...and the stamps <br/>
from 2001 are already really good!  Nice job!  If I recall <br/>
correctly, the three boxes placed in Feb 03 only had one visitor <br/>
before us.  Go check them out!<br/>
