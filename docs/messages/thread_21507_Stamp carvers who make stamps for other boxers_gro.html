stamps for boxes other than their own, so I thought I'd give it a try and put <br/>
out a post.<br/>
<br/>
I've been looking for what seems like forever for places in this neck of the <br/>
woods to plant a box or three that would be a good hard physical challenge.  <br/>
And we've come up with a place where, altho it's not exactly going to be like <br/>
climbing Mount Everest, it's the best we've come up with to date.  Not much <br/>
actual climbing, but it should be more of a hike than most folks around here see <br/>
in a day at least.  It might even involve squishing thru a bit of wet, oh <br/>
horrors. :-)    <br/>
<br/>
It'll take five stamps for the various features:  2 waterfalls (1 manmade, 1 <br/>
natural), 1 artesian well, 1 for the ruins of an old nursery, and one for the <br/>
name of the place -- letters, ugh, I hate doing letters.  There will others, 1 <br/>
for the two railroads involved, 1 of a woodpecker, 1 of poverty oat grass, <br/>
and 1 for a dog involved [1], but I think that I can do those myself if I can <br/>
find a good artist to make the others.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm the best carver of our group and that ain't exactly sayin' much.  Being a <br/>
senior citizen who's close to blind (literally) and having arthritic hands, <br/>
my carving ability is nil.  And it's not going to get any better.  Normally, <br/>
for our boxes, we can "get by" with my carving ability.  But given that these <br/>
boxes will (hopefully) be much more of a challenge, I was thinking of paying <br/>
someone to design and carve some nice stamps -- stamps that'd be worth finding at <br/>
the end of the haul.  Sure, in many ways, it's all about the hike...... :-) <br/>
.....but well designed and carved stamps at the end would be really nice too <br/>
for once.<br/>
<br/>
My other option is to have NW Stamps make a commercial stamp from drawings I <br/>
do, but I wanted to try this route first because my hands aren't even often <br/>
all that good for drawing anymore.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has stamp carving as a sideline and is interested, please contact <br/>
me privately.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

[1] The dog will be a bonus stamp.  This area is frequently hiked by a <br/>
extremely nice slim gray-haired gentleman who travels with a dark short-haired <br/>
hound-dawg type of dog with the most beautiful brindle head I've ever seen.  If any <br/>
boxer meets them and emails us the name of the dog, we'll send the stamp on <br/>
card stock thru the mail to them.  He and his son know I was out scouting <br/>
potential box locations that day, but he doesn't have the foggiest idea that <br/>
there'll be a bonus stamp for his dog's name.  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
He knows the Lemont area blindfolded and gave me some great ideas for future <br/>
quarry stamps,  I&amp;M Canal historical stamps, etc., in that area.  A really <br/>
nice cowboy sort of guy, who has neither the time nor the patience for <br/>
letterboxing himself, but folks are welcome to take up a spot at the campfire, rest <br/>
their feet a bit and talk a spell.  (And boy, I definitely needed to rest my feet <br/>
a bit that day.)    <br/>
