Bummer, bummer that I am so far away.  I am just that person you are<br/>
looking for.  I am a member of two Toastmasters clubs here in Portland.<br/>
In fact, I have actually won the humorous speech contest this year at my<br/>
club and area levels and I go on to compete at  the division level on<br/>
November 3rd.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish I could do the speech for the scouts. It would be wonderful to do<br/>
a speech on letterboxing to an interested audience of eager young<br/>
people!  What a great opportunity for someone back your way!!!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

Amanda, Amanda! I'm breaking out in a cold sweat just THINKING about <br/>
that. Please come visit our cubbies soon, since I think wetting my <br/>
pants in front of 100 12-year olds would kill my own scout's rep for <br/>
years to come.<br/>

what I can do.  With Mark being den leader and me on the committee, <br/>
we can for sure figure something out!!!!!!!<br/>
Oh What a grand idea!!!!!<br/>

What , where, when, why? If it's a weekend day, perhaps CSCM and I could make <br/>
a day of it. I would be happy to do a presentation, but to come to CT, It <br/>
would need to be planned ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if I can help.<br/>
<br/>
cheers!<br/>
