When placing a new hitchhiker, what is the announcement etiquette?  Does one post its existence to the group, or simply let it remain secret? <br/>
Thanks, and I really think this is my last post for the night-<br/>

ps- thanks to everyone's good advice on the inks.  I'll look for some dye-based today and see how it works!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You can announce a hitchhiker, sure!  Most folks simply say that one <br/>
has been released in a particular area, without mentioning which box <br/>
it is in.  Also, there is another message board specifically for <br/>
hitchhikers ..  letterbox_travelers  So if you're wanting to track <br/>
the travels of your HH, that's a good list to sign onto!<br/>
