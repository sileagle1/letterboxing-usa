                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Purple Larva Group went to Henry's Sawmill Site in Estabrook <br/>
Woods.  Instead of finding the LB, we found a hitchhiker (a nice <br/>
surprise) but Henry's itself was not where it should have been.  It <br/>
was found, intact, some 20 feet away beneath some leaves.<br/>
<br/>
It is in fair shape, a little damp though.  The cover is not fitting <br/>
well.  After reading the book and making some comments in it, we <br/>
replaced it in its proper hiding place, then scurried out with the HH.<br/>
<br/>
Future visitors will find it in its listed receptacle.<br/>
