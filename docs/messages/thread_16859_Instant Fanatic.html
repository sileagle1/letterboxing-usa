went to the convenience store to buy a big eraser. I drew on it and <br/>
started carving. I was about 1/4 done when we had to go out. While I <br/>
was out, I bought a six pack of erasers, an exacto knife, an inkpad, <br/>
and a compass. I finished My first large eraser stamp, and decided to <br/>
make one to stamp bills for wheresgeorge.com.  It came out mostly <br/>
legible, not bad for my second real attempt. I think I'm hooked.<br/>

P.S. I am waiting for the feeling to come back to my pinky fingers. <br/>
They went numb holding the eraser and exacto.<br/>

Letterboxing and letterboxers are just great.  Carving will also <br/>
come more and more naturally to you as well.  I am amazed how <br/>
much more concentration it required as I began.  I hope the <br/>
feeling in your fingers returns soon.<br/>
