<div>The sticky box holding the "Troll of 
Kernville" was planted on 4/28/01 by Don &amp; Gwen (Kern County, 
California)  The best time to search 
for this box would be in the evening as it is very exposed.</div>
<div> Find Deb's Bench in Riverside Park.  As 
you are sitting there contemplating nature, take out your compass.  The box 
is at 53 degrees magnetic.  Before you leave Deb's bench count the number 
of letters in her full name.    
Find the entrance to the "Troll's" domain at 20 degrees magnetic.  Walk to 
the north side and continue east to the end.  From the north east end count 
the railing supports towards the middle of the 
structure.   The box is hidden behind 
the railing support that corresponds to the number of letters in Deb's full 
name. Careful, now, don't lean over too far!  The box is very small (1" x 
3"x 4").  There is no book nor stamp pad....just the stamp.  The box 
is silver in color and is attached to the location with Velcro.  This is a 
very busy location during the warmer months due to the rafting and kayaking 
season.  Be discrete when you seek this stamp.  Have fun!.
