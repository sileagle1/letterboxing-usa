Woodland Park and Nature preserve is on Middlesex Road in Darien, CT <br/>
between exits 9 and 10 of I-95. If you take exit 9 (The WWE exit) <br/>
follow the signs for route 106.  CT-106 turns from Courtland Ave into <br/>
Glenbrook Road (right)  Where Glenbrook Road ends, Middlesex Road <br/>
begins.  Woodland Park is about 1/2 mile down Middlesex Road.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Park at the Middlesex Road entrance.  There is a sign with a map at <br/>
the entrance.  Sometimes there are maps you can take there, if not the <br/>
sign shows that the white trail begins to the left of the sign (facing <br/>
the sign) from the left side of the parking area.  Follow the white <br/>
trail.  It will curve to the right.  After passing a log cut in the <br/>
middle to allow the path through, there is a small trail to the right <br/>
forming a Y.  <br/>
