                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We're from Maryland (newbies) and we're going to visit Simsbury, CT <br/>
for a week in September.  Our plan is to spend lots of time <br/>
letterboxing, and we're trying to map out where to look based on the <br/>
clues from the Web site.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any suggestions on towns or forests in the area that would <br/>
be particulary good for letterboxing in the Simsbury area?  We don't <br/>
mind driving 30 miles or so.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
<br/>
Cheri and Steve<br/>

out at Penwood State Park by then!  Also do the Hartford, West Hartford <br/>
(especially the huge amounts of MDC Resevoir boxes!).  If you want to set up an <br/>
exchange, I'm in Simsbury most weekends and would love to meet for an exchange.  <br/>
Also check on those mystery box clues ;-)<br/>
<br/>
E-mail me privately if you want to get together (perhaps at Heublein) for an <br/>
exchange :-)<br/>

numerous series of boxes there so check the website carefully!  I haven't <br/>
been yet, but hope to within the next two weeks.  There are also numerous boxes <br/>
in Simsbury.<br/>

Hope this helps!<br/>
