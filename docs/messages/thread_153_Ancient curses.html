&gt; Another idea to consider comes to us from ancient Egypt.<br/>
&gt;We could simply put a Pharoh's curse over the letterbox.....<br/>
<br/>
oh.... here is one I saved from a bookbinder's list I was on once...<br/>
I knew it would come in handy....<br/>
<br/>
"...an antiquarian religious bookseller has at last<br/>
stumbled on a solution which he claims is working - a 16th-century<br/>
Spanish curse. "For him that stealeth a Book from this Library, let it<br/>
change into a serpent into his hand and rend him. Let him be struck<br/>
with Palsy, and all his Members blasted. Let him languish in Pain<br/>
crying aloud for Mercy and let there be no surcease to his Agony till<br/>
he sink in Dissolution. Let Bookworms gnaw his Entrails in token of<br/>
the Worm that dieth not, and when at last he goeth to his final<br/>
Punishment, let the flames of Hell consume him for ever and aye."..."<br/>

1950s in which he stopped a lynch mob.  He became so involved in the role that<br/>
he cursed out the mob.  What he said was bleeped out on the tape later, but it<br/>
seemed to be something along the lines of calling them "Goddamned Sons of<br/>
Bitches."  <br/>
<br/>
His career was about to be destroyed because of the controversy, but a noted<br/>
minister of the day wrote a public letter that pointed out there are times<br/>
when it is right to ask God to damn some people.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went out today to check on my letterboxes.  One of them had obviously been<br/>
found, as the lid had not been replaced.  No one had signed the book, but the<br/>
intruder had been thoughtful enough to put the book back in the plastic bag<br/>
and leave everything intact.  Relieved, I made my way back home, sat on the<br/>
couch and fell asleep.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly I awoke to a vision of a mysterious figure.  Garbed in a long, hooded<br/>
robe, he had the face of a fox and the wings of an eagle.  He reached out to<br/>
me and handed me a map, with a big red X on it, labeled LETTERBOX.  Then, he<br/>
began to speak:<br/>
<br/>
	Be ye warned and be ye ware<br/>
	This letterbox was placed with care.<br/>
	And on its lid was placed a spell<br/>
	Of Joy for those who treat it well.<br/>
<br/>
	But, touch this box with ill intent,<br/>
	Your eyes will cross, your head will dent.<br/>
	Your knees will lock, your feet will ache.<br/>
	Your hair will fall, your nails will break.<br/>
<br/>
	Your throat will burn, your ears will ring.<br/>
	Your nose will turn bright red and sting.<br/>
	You'll lose your bladder, toss your lunch.<br/>
	Your skin will crawl.  Your back will hunch.<br/>
<br/>
	You'll watch your fingers turn to stones.<br/>
	And little worms will eat your bones.<br/>
	When this is over, things get worse...<br/>
	Be smart.  Don't risk the Letterbox Curse. <br/>
<br/>
I could have sworn I heard him say his name was Thom... But then I suddenly<br/>
awoke and nobody was near... and I realized it was all a dream.<br/>
<br/>
Wait a minute... I just found this peculiar little map on the floor by the<br/>
couch....<br/>
I have to go now!!!!<br/>

I was wondering if it needed some magical symbols or Egyptian hieroglyphics<br/>
for extra effect?  Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
When we get it just right I'll put it on a webpage for everyone to download.<br/>
