Apparently the woods near the firing range were, shall we say, <br/>
singed.  One of the hazards of being a demon hangout, I suppose.  The <br/>
box, however, is in excellent condition and the small conflagration <br/>
has been effectively extinguished.  We took the liberty of upgrading <br/>
the stamp in the box.  For those who have already found the box, be <br/>
satisfied that you now have a rare collectors' edition imprint of our <br/>
first "primitive art" stamp.  For those of you yet to find the box, <br/>
you can look forward to having a new and (we think) greatly improved <br/>
stamp.  Thanks for the heads up, MM!<br/>

&gt; First off, there won't be a hint in the EMS store video, as we <br/>
weren't able to make the video :)<br/>
&gt; Now, on to boxes.  We've found Say What, Paint Works and the <br/>
Glendora Tavern box all ok.  Also, we've done our EMS staff boxes and <br/>
they're there with no errors.  <br/>
&gt; I could not find the 70 million years ago box.  I had the spot, and <br/>
a pile of rocks, but to no avail.  I have seen that others have had <br/>
trouble finding it.  It is a bit of a popular place, as there were <br/>
beer cans strewn about.<br/>
&gt; Now, on to Splashing in the Devil's tub.  I have a friend that <br/>
found it last week.  I went today however, and the wildlife <br/>
management area in that spot was on fire :-(   I obviously could not <br/>
get it myself.  So you may want to check on it's safety soon.<br/>
