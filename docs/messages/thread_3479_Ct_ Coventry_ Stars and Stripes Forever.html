nation watched our heroes in their finest hour. We grieve for the <br/>
lost and celebrate the greatness that helps us to pick up and move <br/>
on. This is nothing new in America. So In Coventry follow signs to <br/>
the Nathan Hale Homestead , South Street, home of our nations <br/>
earliest hero. Nathan a young school teacher gave his life for our <br/>
nation in the Revolutionary War. His family home ( a muesam open from <br/>
May 15- Oct15 ,1-5 daily) is site of our Stars and Stripes Letterbox. <br/>
Go To the Flag, flying proudly in the center lot. Take a bearing of <br/>
280 degrees. Look off in that direction to a Holy Grove. There in the <br/>
base of a hollow tree a memory to bravery lies in wait. Camoflage <br/>
your secret stamping activity by pretending to take photographs or <br/>
draw as so many folks stop by to do that here. Enjoy another <br/>
letterbox with a history lesson from the Leader of the Pack with help <br/>
from Lixo.<br/>
