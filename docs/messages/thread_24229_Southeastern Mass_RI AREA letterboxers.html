There is a major lacking in letterboxes around here even though there<br/>
are tons of great spots to put them. So...I was thinking about<br/>
rounding up a few (or a bunch of) volunteers to sort of promise to<br/>
place a letterbox or two in this area.<br/>
That way anyone else who lives in this area like I do can have some<br/>
letterboxes close to home.<br/>

Also, if anyone thinks this is a horrible idea, that's cool too just<br/>
let me know.<br/>

  We're close enough that we would plant a series here, in fact we probably have enough carved already.  Where do you suggest?   The only issue might be maintenance.  We're close enough to plant, but running out to replace a missing one will be more difficult!  And we'd need your suggestion for where to plant a series.<br/>
