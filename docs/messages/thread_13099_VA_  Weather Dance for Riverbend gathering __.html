Riverbend picnic Saturday!<br/>
<br/>
Folklore around here has it that if you wear your pajamas backwards and yell<br/>
"snow,snow,snow" out the window before a big snow is predicted,school will<br/>
cancelled the next day because of snow!  With all the snow we had this past<br/>
year I would say it worked. Although,we homeschool so there are NO snow days<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
We're really excited about the picnic this weekend...we'll bring our family<br/>
favorite 'mess of homemade macaroni and cheese, made with extra sharp cabot<br/>
cheese.<br/>
<br/>
See everyone at lunchtime,<br/>
Happy Homeschoolers<br/>

Hi, all - yes I said meet at the pinic area near the boat dock but there's <br/>
actually a better area to the left of the visitor's center, with grills.  I also <br/>
found that I might be able to reserve the covered pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
I have an important poll for all - shall we move the gathering to the second <br/>
Saturday in June, in the hopes that it will be drier?  Or, brave the rain and <br/>
miserable soaking?<br/>
<br/>
I ask this as last Saturday I went to try and plant my boxes and was unable <br/>
to do so due to the rain and the fact that many of the trails near the river <br/>
(and even some uphill!)  were completely impassable.  One spot we waded through <br/>
sounded as though it were actually being undermined by a current under the <br/>
ground.  One small-looking puddle turned out to be about four feet deep (missin' <br/>
my hip waders then, y'all!).  Hill trails were too muddy and slippery to <br/>
safely climb.  The current weather forecast is for rain every day this week until <br/>
Saturday, then sun on Saturday.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else planted new boxes for the gathering?<br/>
<br/>
What does everyone think?  I'm sure you can handle it, Psychomommy, eh?  <br/>
