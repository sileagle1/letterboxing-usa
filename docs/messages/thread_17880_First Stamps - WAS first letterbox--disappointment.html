I am so glad I am not the only one attached to their first stamp!  We<br/>
are still very new to this, but I made our stamps right away... before I<br/>
had much knowledge of carving tools and materials.  Out stamps are very<br/>
basic and kinda scary (and I have very little, if any, artistic<br/>
abilites)... LOL... but, I have decided at this time that I do not want<br/>
to make new ones since this is what we started with.<br/>
<br/>
I can only imagine the faces on those who find our stamps and the<br/>
thoughts that must go through their mind! =]<br/>

<br/>
The first two boxes I ever found had store bought stamps.   I was<br/>
thrilled <br/>
with both of them.<br/>
<br/>
One of my plants had (It's since disappeared.   I think the squirrels<br/>
got it) <br/>
a store-bought stamp.   It was exactly what I wanted for that box, and<br/>
beyond <br/>
my ability to carve.   I noted on the clues, so if it was that important<br/>
to <br/>
someone, they didn't have to go after it.<br/>
<br/>
My personal stamp is store bought.   I got it originally just so I could<br/>
get <br/>
out there and get boxing fast.   Then, when I got to where I could think<br/>
about <br/>
carving one, I'd gotten attached to the one I had.   It was "me," you<br/>
know?   <br/>
So I added a few embellishments with colored pencils, to make it more<br/>
unique, <br/>
but it's still the same basic design.<br/>
<br/>
Despite these handicaps, I'm having a wonderful time with letterboxing.<br/>
