I agree. There is no reason to change the "front end" so to speak if you're just <br/>
updating the xml, html, xhmlzyk - or whatever - why can't you keep the graphics <br/>
the same? Do we have to make a poll about this? I love the design and that it is also <br/>

not change that, but updating the operating software and hoohah is <br/>

The one thing I was wildly curious about as I read through the information and archives was what the actual stamp images were supposed to look like! So many people shared compliments over this boxes' stamp and that team's stamp...but I had no idea what a hand-carved stamp would or should look like. Now I realize that most of us would prefer to preserve the mystery surrounding our stamps...after all, that's part of what drives us to hunt these boxes down. But newcomers might appreciate a few examples of what to expect...and what's expected. Maybe a few samples, illustrating the various styles and sizes of stamps could be featured on the new web-page...inverse, outline, signature, event, hitchhikers, micros, etc. That would give a gague...a creative push...a framework...an aspiration...to people who are excited to get involved! <br/>

Unfortunately that is pretty much against the letterboxing code to distribute images <br/>

<br/>
We're not talking about changing operating systems here.<br/>
<br/>
Changing graphic designs, yes.<br/>
<br/>
To quote:<br/>
    " . . . create a new look for LbNA, while keeping the present theme.<br/>
    Variations are expected and invited . . . "<br/>
<br/>
Also:<br/>
    "Pages must scale for multiple resolutions. One of the current problems<br/>
     with the 'scroll' paper is that it limits the size of the page to 600<br/>
pixels.<br/>
     Those with higher resolutions can't take advantage of them."<br/>
<br/>
So, there are plenty of reasons to change the way the underlying graphics<br/>
work.<br/>
The trick is how to do it while 'keeping the present theme', emphasizing the<br/>
many aspects of letterboxing, and making it look spiffy to boot.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I just used the word spiffy.<br/>
<br/>
I know we have a lot of creative people out there, and I'm excited to see<br/>
what they're going to come up with!<br/>

I'm curious to see how people tribute the "old world" while <br/>
creating new.  While I see the need for change, it is a bit painful <br/>
to think of losing Der Mad Stamper's design which has become <br/>
such a signature of letterboxing in the U.S.  I look forward to <br/>
seeing what creative ideas people come up with.<br/>
<br/>
just a few thoughts . . .<br/>

  &gt; &gt; I really like the old world look that we have on the title page -- hint<br/>
  hint<br/>
  &gt; &gt; to any contestants<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I agree. There is no reason to change the "front end" so to speak if<br/>
  you're just<br/>
  &gt; updating the xml, html, xhmlzyk - or whatever - why can't you keep the<br/>
  graphics<br/>
  &gt; the same? Do we have to make a poll about this? I love the design and that<br/>
  it is also<br/>
  &gt; somewhat tricky for folks who come there for the first time. It is unique<br/>
  and I would<br/>
  &gt; not change that, but updating the operating software and hoohah is<br/>
  &gt; understandable and most likely necessary.<br/>
<br/>
  We're not talking about changing operating systems here.<br/>
<br/>
  Changing graphic designs, yes.<br/>
<br/>
  To quote:<br/>
      " . . . create a new look for LbNA, while keeping the present theme.<br/>
      Variations are expected and invited . . . "<br/>
<br/>
  Also:<br/>
      "Pages must scale for multiple resolutions. One of the current problems<br/>
       with the 'scroll' paper is that it limits the size of the page to 600<br/>
  pixels.<br/>
       Those with higher resolutions can't take advantage of them."<br/>
<br/>
  So, there are plenty of reasons to change the way the underlying graphics<br/>
  work.<br/>
  The trick is how to do it while 'keeping the present theme', emphasizing the<br/>
  many aspects of letterboxing, and making it look spiffy to boot.<br/>
<br/>
  Yes, I just used the word spiffy.<br/>
<br/>
  I know we have a lot of creative people out there, and I'm excited to see<br/>
  what they're going to come up with!<br/>

Keeping that Old World look is fine--it's very elegant and in <br/>

years, I'd like to see SOMETHING change and suprise me.  =)<br/>

favor a slight realignment of regions within Washington--if only, <br/>
just to separate the clues by counties in and around the Puget Sound <br/>

following counties should probably have their own chunk of real <br/>
estate on the letterboxing website:<br/>
<br/>
King<br/>
Pierce<br/>
Thurston<br/>
Snohomoish<br/>
<br/>
As it currently stands, some of these counties are combined and the <br/>
list of letterboxers for the region goes on and on and on--making it <br/>
almost impossible to find specific clues in which you're interested.<br/>

Ah but that's assuming that we don't ASK in advance.  There are people <br/>
out there like me who really don't CARE whether their stamp images are <br/>
