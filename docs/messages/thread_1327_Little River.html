                    <div class="plaintext-content">Helpppppp! Our voices echoed out over the valley, the only sound to <br/>
return was the soft  landing of the leaves as they dropped in <br/>
colorful showers. Seriously now, could anyone help clarify the  <br/>
Little River box after you reach the throne of stones. A couple more <br/>
pieces and we might have found it. There were several walls  and we <br/>
checked three. because we weren't sure which you meant. Did you go <br/>
back the way you came or onward we tried both and yet another west <br/>
facing wall . Did you do  paces of every left foot, or each step we <br/>
tried both but still no box. There is a lot of mica in all those <br/>
walls. So if anybody can clarify it we would love to return and  find <br/>
it. The  Rock Spring Box was great ! Thank you for that one we sure <br/>
did enjoy seeing who had been there.  It was a great hike on the best <br/>
day o fall yet. Oh , back to Little River a note on how to get back <br/>
to the car would help we ended up coming out on 97 then walking a <br/>
ways down the side of the road to find our car. It was okay but It <br/>
would be good to mention it in clues. Thanks Carol<br/>

Sometimes you find 'em and sometimes you don't...the Little River <br/>
took my 9 year old to solve, but when he found it, there it was. It's <br/>
all in perspective and how you interpret and how they're written and <br/>
also in how distracting the fall foliage is. What I would suggest is, <br/>
go back again later and try not to do anything you did the first <br/>
time. Worked for us at both Pharisee Rock and North Mount Sugarloaf, <br/>
which took a second try each and were totally worth the effort.<br/>
<br/>
Jay in nice job Melissa and Dan on that there two-fer!<br/>
