<br/>
Calkins Point letterbox is alive and well.  It was however quite lonely <br/>
after not having any visitors since September.  Excellent hiding spot, and <br/>
we just loved all the views!  If you have a dog... Bring Em to this park!!<br/>
<br/>
Titlow Beach letterbox is safe and sound, but soggy.  Again, *wonderful* <br/>
views!   Having not read the clues in advance, I had no idea what a Madrona <br/>
tree was, but with a little trial and error we found the box.  Great <br/>
container, btw.  Oh and the trains going by were too cool.<br/>
<br/>
While in the area we hit Glenn's Titlow Park boxes.  We completely overshot <br/>
the Hummingbird box and found ourselves close to the eagle.  My mother <br/>
actually found this one all on her own while I was on a different part of <br/>
the trail scratching my head still not sure what a Madrona treed look like <br/>
(her first time for her own "find")...  After locating the Eagle, were both <br/>
certain that we will never again have trouble identifying Madrona's.  (Note <br/>
to self: pack NW Tree and Plant field guide with LB gear.).  I was very <br/>
pleased with my very first "Glenn Letterbox" find.  The box and contents are <br/>
all in great shape.<br/>
<br/>
After returning the box to it's hiding place, we then got to enjoy a <br/>
beautiful sunset over Puget sound.<br/>
<br/>
In the failing light, we did try to locate the Hummingbird box, but it just <br/>
got too dark too fast.  However, we loved the park and beach, and we *will* <br/>
return for the hummingbird.  <g><br/>
