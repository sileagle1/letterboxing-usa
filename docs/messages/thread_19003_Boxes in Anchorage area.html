<br/>
My husband and I will be visiting the Anchorage, AK area especially Cooper's Landing, Eklutna Lake and various other places in the next few weeks.  I contacted the placers of a few of those letterboxes and am not getting "warm fuzzies" that the boxes are alive and well.  (See response below from one of the planters as well as comments on the placement of some of the other boxes that have been planted prior to 2001.)  Can anyone from the area let me know if they have been to any of the boxes in Anchorage area and if they are in tact?  Any help is appreciated.  We have a tight schedule and would really like to do some boxing while we're there.  Rush Gatherer and PowWow Dancer have kindly donated a carved stamp of CT with the Mountain Laurel (state flower) for me to plant as a hitch hiker.  Thanks for any help you can provide.<br/>

&gt;     I am sorry to report we moved from the state last year so I am not<br/>
&gt;positive on the state of our boxes.  I did receive a post card last year saying the<br/>
&gt;double trouble and waterfall boxes were alive as well as the BugBox however,<br/>
&gt;the area has been expanded which throws off the first few clues. (my kids hid<br/>
&gt;this one so the clues are extremely easy and it is so deep any improvements on<br/>
&gt;the area couldn't be so extensive as to move the box).<br/>
&gt;     I will also issue a warning - there were come boxes hidden before 2001<br/>
&gt;that are not ours and the clues are literally backwards!!  We found this out the<br/>
&gt;hard way while traveling with 4 small (oldest 5) kids in tow.<br/>
&gt;     Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
