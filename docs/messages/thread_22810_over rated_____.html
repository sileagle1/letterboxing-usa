<br/>
The more he posts, the less anybody else needs to post.  If the people of<br/>
New Hampshire are happy with him the way he seems to feel they are, more<br/>
power to 'em.  And if he really feels that the entire rest of the country<br/>
*must* accept him the way New Hampshire has, more power to *him*.<br/>
<br/>
I'll just put a note in with my hitchhikers requesting that they never be<br/>
transported to New Hampshire.  Hopefully that should lessen my chances of<br/>
ending up with any hijacked hitchhikers. Since some folks seem to respect<br/>
only the written word actually accompanying a hitchhiker instead of thinking<br/>
thru any unwritten courtesies based on respect for an artist, putting such a<br/>
note in with my hitchhikers should work, right?<br/>
<br/>
But I guess if I ever found a hitchhiker that had been "changed" by<br/>
gingerbreadjunk, maybe I'd likely just go ahead and attempt to restore it to<br/>
it's original travelling condition. If he feels he can change an artist's<br/>
work, I guess I could feel that I could restore it.  If he feels he's some<br/>
sort of "owner" because he's stamped in, hey, that same game can be played<br/>
in different ways, y'know?  :-)<br/>

<br/>
Gee, why is it that some things/people are inappropriate but others<br/>
don't seem to be?<br/>
<br/>
Why is gingerbreadjunk allowed to tell people to shut up, berate the<br/>
owner of the HH in question and demean another member here,<br/>
demanding they be "put in their place", but few people call him on<br/>
it, but here we are jumping all over someone who gives him right<br/>
back a portion of what he's handing out?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess there's a double standard that I haven't yet figured out the<br/>
guidelines for.  If you have a certain name and reputation, or are a<br/>
new member wanting to make great changes before you've even taken<br/>
the time to educate yourself past "place the stamp image in the<br/>
logbook, put the stamp back in the box, rehide the box" anything you<br/>
do is cool.<br/>
<br/>
If you happen to be someone less 'godlike' or have strong opinions<br/>
about the heritage of the hobby you are automatically blasted out of<br/>
the water without thought.  Evil, evil person to stop and say "hey,<br/>
wait, have you researched this or thought this out?"<br/>
<br/>
Nevermind trying to explain it to me, I don't care to hear it.  I've<br/>
figured it out myself.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
and why??  <br/>
<br/>
I hadn't even found any boxes before planting and as i do find some <br/>
i realized that it isn't really expected of me to go as far as i do <br/>
to make good clues etc.  after reading lots of clues online I <br/>
sometimes think i shouldn't get so detailed with my clues...so, in <br/>
other words...I worked hard on my clues and made sure they were <br/>
correct right down to the letter...made them fun...etc before seeing <br/>
how simple or vague clues are.<br/>
<br/>
the challenge is in making the clues actually lead you on your way <br/>
to a find...and them not be much guessing involved...but still make <br/>
riddles etc too.<br/>
<br/>
