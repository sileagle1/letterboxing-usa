It seems lately when I have been letterboxing I have<br/>
fallen victim to a form of Murpheys Law (anything that<br/>
can go wrong, will).  I call it Murpheys Law Of <br/>
Letterboxing #1, which states:  No matter how remote<br/>
a letterboxing site is, or what time of day it is, there<br/>
will be non-boxers around.  I have hiked many miles on<br/>
a trail I have never heard of at dawn and still had<br/>
people resting on the very spot where the letterbox resides.<br/>
I have followed lonely trails through dark woods only<br/>
to have two lovers in passionate embrace in the exact<br/>
letterbox spot.  It can be frustrating if it is a box<br/>
you will not be able to go back for, or don't have time<br/>
to out-wait the other visitors.<br/>
I'm sure others have experienced similar Laws, so let's<br/>
hear some of them.  Maybe we can compile a list.<br/>

&gt; hear some of them.  Maybe we can compile a list.<br/>
<br/>
Doing your best to be discrete while searching for a letterbox at a <br/>
seaside location, you are observed by bored folks living in an RV at <br/>
the beach.  Bored folks want to liven things up a bit, and call the <br/>
police to report a possibly under-the-influence and/or irrational <br/>
person along the beach.  The local gendarmes arrive and you are <br/>
subjected to many tests to determine your state of mind, your license <br/>
and registration are confiscated so that they can look you up in the <br/>
bad guy database, and they threaten to call the Department of Social <br/>
Services to take away my three children who were letterboxing with me.<br/>
<br/>
In all this melee, I dropped my letterboxing bag, containing log and <br/>
stamp, so I couldn't even prove what I was doing (not that I wanted <br/>
to give them the satisfaction anyway).<br/>
<br/>
Since they were unable to determine that anything was wrong with me, <br/>
they finally let me go, but a state trooper follows me all the way <br/>
home.  As in to my driveway.<br/>
<br/>
And, yes, I did recover my letterboxing bag, under *great* stealth, a <br/>
day later.<br/>

More specifically, a downpour starts the exact moment you are as<br/>
physically far from the car as you can get.  I had *just* found Tom's<br/>
Letterbox in Syracuse when I was caught in a downpour.  By the time I<br/>
had hiked the half-mile back to the truck, I looked like a drowned<br/>
river rat!<br/>

You will drop the inkpad on the trail ... and it will land ink side <br/>
down in the dirt, leaf litter, etc.<br/>
