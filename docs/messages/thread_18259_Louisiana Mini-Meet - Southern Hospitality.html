wish that I could have been there.  <br/>
I can also vouch for Steve's work and I am glad for him <br/>
that letterboxing is finally taking off in Louisiana.<br/>
He has waited a long time.<br/>

&gt; The first Louisiana meet, although "mini" was a great event!  Kudos <br/>
&gt; to Steve for coordinating and for boiling the yummy crawfish.  <br/>
&gt; (Crawdads to the rest of the country...the Baudrys, recent <br/>
&gt; transplants from WA can testify that they are delicious!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks to Cami for procuring and bringing the awesome event boxes.  <br/>
&gt; I spent most of my time at the event admiring journals with <br/>
&gt; wonderful stamps from just about every name I've seen in 3 months <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; this list. That was a very special surprise!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And Steve's event stamp is on a par with any I've seen.  I truly <br/>
&gt; think that if more people could see Steve's work, he'd have a <br/>
&gt; reputation as a carver equal to any in the country!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We even made a mini-poster - I'll upload a photo as soon as I get <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; digital camera back from where I accidently left it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the number of boxers in this area has more than doubled in <br/>
&gt; the last 6 months and we might see even more growth in the next 12 <br/>
&gt; months.  Y'all come!<br/>

Well, I don't know about *SO* many!  But it's a start.  What part of <br/>
the state will you be visiting?  I hope it's Baton Rouge.<br/>

I've never had much luck with the freshwater fish.  I prefer the <br/>
marshes where you can get big redfish or speckled trout or <br/>
flounder.  And if the fish aren't biting, you can still always come <br/>
home with a dinner of blue crab.  But I haven't been fishing in a <br/>
long time...<br/>
