                    <div class="plaintext-content"> Thanks to all who offered ideas on the use of an ammo box.  I've noticed <br/>
that there is a nice rubber seal all around the top of the box so contents <br/>
should definitely stay dry.<br/>
 I has taken me five days to do it, but The Reading Adventure hybrid box has <br/>
now been planted.  I've tried every day on my lunch/dinner breaks to plant <br/>
the ammo box "discreetly".  It's not exactly a box you can walk with <br/>
inconspicuously.  I knew that once the box was planted, the chances of it <br/>
being spotted were slim, but it was getting to box from my car to its <br/>
location that was the hard part.  As many noted in earlier posts, terrorism, <br/>
bomb squads, and public paranoia cause more tact on my part.  The box is <br/>
clearly labeled as a letterbox so hopefully, I don't get too many calls from <br/>
the bomb squad.<br/>
 For those of you interested, this box is a hybrid of a traditional <br/>
letterbox, HHH, and bookcrossing depot.  I think it will be really cool once <br/>
people start visiting it. I'm trying my hardest to get Champaign County Ohio <br/>
represented on the LB map.  This box is right next to the Simon Kenton bike <br/>
trail, and it has a nice pavilion for future gatherings (ahem, anyone <br/>
interested?)<br/>
 So come visit. <br/>
