LP and I went to NYC and during and along the way we picked up an <br/>
exchanges with Lightening Bug, Kirby Rider and Freeloading Ferret!<br/>
<br/>
We also picked up a hitchhiker (Mr. Moneybags)<br/>
<br/>
And looking for three boxes, found 2!<br/>
<br/>
Metropolitan Museum of Art is doing just fine. Thanks to True Indigo.<br/>
So is Halloween Adventure, thanks Q.<br/>
<br/>
Went looking for Near a Folly and couldn't find it, but just checked <br/>
the Web site which says it's now unavailable.  So, that should tell <br/>

<br/>
Thanks LB and FF - what a pleasant meet!<br/>
