                    <div class="plaintext-content">I find it very ironic that I have to post to comment about all of <br/>
the postings about unnecessary postings.  Have you noticed how <br/>
cluttered the board has become with this nonsense? <br/>
<br/>
The karma on this site has been muddied.  This is a message board so <br/>
people post messages.  Telling people what they can and cannot talk <br/>
about seems contrary to the open-minded, no rules ethos of <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Why do we feel we must control the actions of others?  If we don't <br/>
like what they do, can't we just choose to ignore their actions?  <br/>
Must we constantly try to bend others to our will?  <br/>
<br/>
Just a thought,<br/>
