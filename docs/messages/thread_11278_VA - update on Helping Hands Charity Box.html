<div>Well, it's been a long, cold and snowy winter.  Just the conditions that made it tough to get to the Helping Hands box.  We had to wait for the snow to melt and the knee to heal to check it out for ourselves.  The traffic has been light, due to the weather, we're sure.  So, BeMa is going to make a donation above the amount of stamps placed in January and February.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks so much to those who were able to make it. </div>

<div>The garden is starting to come to life with the bulbs popping through the soil.  Plus, there seems to be an odd absence of Canadian Geese!  Of course, their digestive remains are still somehow abundant...  But, the next several weeks are going to be mild and hopefully sunny -- the perfect time to seek out the box!  If you get there soon, there may even be an added bonus awaiting you...</div>

<div>Thanks!  BeMa</div>
