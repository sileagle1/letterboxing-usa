Be advised that if you choose to walk around the gates (I don't know if that is allowed) the walk up the hill is VERY steep and about a half mile. I have put a note in the clues that these boxes are not available till Spring. If I get a chance to talk to the staff and ask permission (&amp; get it) I'll note that in the clues. Either way, don't attempt to get up there if the roads are the least bit icy or snow covered!<br/>
