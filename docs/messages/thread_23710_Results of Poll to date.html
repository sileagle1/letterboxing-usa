This are the results from a poll I ran on my blog <br/>
http://bakersletterboxing.blogspot.com/<br/>
that many of you had participated in. <br/>
<br/>
I have two boxes that would be considered "I like harder hikes, but <br/>
straight forward clues", and the rest are defiantly easier, but even <br/>
though the votes are almost even, the harder one don't see any <br/>
visitors. One has only had one, and it really is a nice place. <br/>
<br/>
Just from my observations, I think that only a very few like to <br/>
extreme puzzles with the challenging hike, while most like the grab <br/>
and go's and the puzzles. I think that if a larger sample was taken <br/>
that you would see the bottom two choices pull away<br/>
<br/>
I personally am not ging to place anymore g&amp;g's unless the location <br/>
really warrants it. It is nice to get the increased action, but I <br/>
have been having people not even having stamps signing in and then <br/>
not re-hiding very well. Twice my one g&amp;g has been soaked. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all those who stopped by my blog and votes<br/>
