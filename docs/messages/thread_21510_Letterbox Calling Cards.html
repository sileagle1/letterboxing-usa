Hi Karen,<br/>
I have added a file titled:  Letterboxing Information.pdf to the file <br/>
section. It prints on Avery stock #5388 that will print 3x5 cards.  I <br/>
made these for a presentation that I did to my Rotary Club as an <br/>
activity for Grandparents to do with their grand kids.  I now keep <br/>
them in my planner as I'm always being asked and this is easier to <br/>
read than by atrocious handwriting.  Feel free to use it.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you muchly.  The more info that people can get, the better.  Plus it is easier to give someone a card instead of trying to find the paper/pen/correct web sites.  It would also be a great way to get the word out, especially to the areas that are not lucky enough to have as many as some states. <br/>
Happy Letterboxing..........Karen<br/>
