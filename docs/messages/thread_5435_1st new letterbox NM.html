                    <div class="plaintext-content">On May 16, 2002 Funhog placed La Mariposa Letterbox in Pojoaque Pueblo, <br/>
Santa Fe County, New Mexico. Every June the Butterfly Run is held here. <br/>
This letterbox is hidden along the route of this annual event. Although <br/>
this short walk is on tribal land I was assured that it was OK for non-<br/>
tribal members to walk the route of the Run.<br/>
<br/>
to the trailhead: Travel north from Santa Fe about 15 minutes on route <br/>
285. When you come to the Pueblo of Pojoaque exit the highway onto the <br/>
eastern frontage road, Cities of Gold Road.  Go north past the casino <br/>
and continue uphill following the signs approximately one mile to the <br/>
Wellness Center at 101 Lightning Loop. Leave your car in this large <br/>
parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
to the letterbox: Walk uphill on the gravel road from the parking lot, <br/>
keeping right at all forks. You will soon meet two rotund giants, <br/>
guardians of the desert's most precious resource. Their landscaping is <br/>
rather sparse, having but one tree in their front yard. From this tree <br/>
you will walk to its brother, 44 yards away at 340 degrees magnetic. At <br/>
its base, beneath loose wood you will find La Mariposa.<br/>
