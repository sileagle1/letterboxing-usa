Yesterday JugglerMouse and I went up above Cambria and were first <br/>
finders of "Driftwood by the Sea" placed by Pam and Scott. It was a <br/>
beautiful location and the stamp is elegant.  Pam and Scott's <br/>
personal stamp for their SPCA is also incredibly beautiful. I <br/>
definitely want an exchange with them. If you are reading this SPCA, <br/>
we are planning on being at the Sept 6th Bay Area event and the Oct <br/>
4th Central Coast Event. Please, try to be there, too? I want to go <br/>
after any other stamps these folks have planted. So will you!<br/>
<br/>
Slager, that nasty fox who imprisoned the Redwall dibbuns, has been <br/>
planted. We know ALL foxes are not nasty, honestly. Just this one is <br/>
very bad. I am sure that JugglerMouse will have the clues up soon in <br/>
case any fox fanciers might be in this area next weekend.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, if certain fox-fanciers were to give us a holler when they were <br/>
down here, we have a place they might find to their taste. Nice <br/>
place with fine footstomping music and great barbeque. Just sayin', <br/>
you know...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I checked in at Stamp Luis Obispo, our local stamping store. The <br/>
owner has offered to put up a flier for our October 4th event. I was <br/>
not sure we wanted to do that, you know. And, get this, she is <br/>
donating some MasterCarve for us to use for a raffle! Even said she <br/>
would be happy to have a stamp behind the counter for us stampers to <br/>
tag up on. Well, sure is nice to find such support. Remember, they <br/>
carry and ship MasterCarve ("carves like butter"). <br/>
toll free 1-877-875-5516  and their site is <br/>
http://www.studiosblackbird.com/store.php <br/>
They do not have MasterCarve listed as stock but they usually have <br/>
it in. Call them (and mention that we sent you.)<br/>
<br/>
Happy to be stamping around here,<br/>

Thanks for the tip - I will check it out this Friday when I am in the area - will also take <br/>
a look for that fancy Fox.  Will write to you off-list about this joint we should be <br/>
checking out.<br/>
<br/>
I am thrilled that you will be making the trip up here on September 6th!  Who all do <br/>
you think will be attending?  You'll more than likely be able to talk some of the <br/>
attendees into making it down your way in October.<br/>

We stumbled upon the Stamp Luis Obispo shop when we were in town a couple of <br/>
weekends ago and my 8-year-old decided to spend her allowance money on a <br/>
"Topaz" cat's eye stamp pad - am I raising her right or what?<br/>
