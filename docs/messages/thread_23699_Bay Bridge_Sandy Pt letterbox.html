                    <div class="plaintext-content">When visiting Maryland last week, we were hiking a nature trail in the <br/>
Sandy Point State Park.  Walking back to the parking lot, my son <br/>
noticed a plastic bag sticking out from under a small stump.  Being <br/>
geocachers, we first thought it was a geocache, but soon discovered it <br/>
was a letterbox.  The log book was very wet, but the stamp was still <br/>
there.  We didn't have anything to sign the logbook with (I realize <br/>
you don't sign the logbook, you stamp it), but recorded any pertinent <br/>
information we could find from the info sheet. (And no...we didn't <br/>
take the stamp... we know better!  I know this has been a problem when <br/>
letterboxes have been found by some geocachers.)<br/>
<br/>
We found the correct letterbox (bay bridge/Sandy Pt) and found it was <br/>
hidden by MonkeyShines.  He has reported that the letterbox is <br/>
possibly missing, so I wrote to him (two ways... one via the "contact <br/>
the placer" link, and also through the address he provided.  The <br/>
address he provided bounced back (mailbox full).<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to post somewhere that it still is there, and it appears to <br/>
be in the location he described.  We didn't take any pictures, though.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know MonkeyShines so he can be contacted?  I have no idea <br/>
how long it has been since someone found it.  Is there a way to "log" <br/>
your finds online, the way many people do with geocaching?  It was <br/>
cool to find a letterbox, though.... <br/>

another letterboxer contact me asking for information, since she <br/>
hopes to adopt the letterbox since it is there.<br/>
<br/>
There are quite a few letterboxes in the central Texas area and we <br/>
hope to start letterboxing, along with geocaching.  We just have to <br/>
wait until it cools off a bit!  Right now, at 7:30 pm (central) it <br/>
is still 98 degrees outside!  We got back from Maryland yesterday to <br/>
be greeted by triple digit temps....  I wanna go back to Maryland... <br/>
back to the 70's and 80's!<br/>
