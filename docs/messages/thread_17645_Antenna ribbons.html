As far as the color, brown is good, green is better but what about <br/>
the LBNA colors orange green and blue.  When I first received my <br/>
patch hated the color but after sewing it to my backpack I realized <br/>
that it stood out like a poorly hid letterbox.  So why not make the <br/>

I love this idea! Braided on the antenna is good but my antenna retracts when <br/>
I turn off my car. Won't put a bumper sticker on it either but I will tie <br/>
something fun to my roof rack. Orange, green and Blue braided grosgrain ribbons <br/>
flying in the breeze?<br/>

Won't put a bumper sticker on it either <br/>
Anyone who has seen my van knows it's covered with bumperstickers...what most <br/>
don't know is that they are REMOVEABLE!!!!<br/>
<br/>
You can get magnetic film at craft stores like Michaels,and bumpersticker <br/>
vendors like Northern Sun sell pre-fab sticker magnets especially for those of us <br/>
who don't wish to ruin the re-sale value of our vehicles. Northern Sun also <br/>
carries plastic sleeves with suction cups to put stickers in your windows <br/>
without actually gluing them down.<br/>
<br/>
Just food for thought... :-)<br/>
