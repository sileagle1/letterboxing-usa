<br/>
Lemme explain:<br/>
<br/>
Heidi and I are walking in the American Cancer Society's "Relay for <br/>
Life" on June 7 + 8 at Montville High School. For more info visit: <br/>
http://www.cancer.org/docroot/GI/gi_1.asp<br/>
This is a 24 hour walking relay to benefit the neverending research <br/>
on a nasty disease.  Last year we each walked 15 miles in the 24-hour <br/>
period and were both exhausted, but its a good cause! I think our <br/>
team raised appx $2000 last year as well.  I've taken a particular <br/>
devotion to participating in the event after losing a grandmother, <br/>
aunt, and a dear friend in high school to the disease.  Anyways, I <br/>
just (like 15 minutes ago) finished a stamp that we will have at the <br/>
event. If anyone would like to stop by and support us (or even walk a <br/>
few laps!!!) we'd be happy to have you and reward you with a stamp!  <br/>
Call it event stamp, traveller, whatever...ya get the point!  <br/>
<br/>
Donations are welcome but certainly NOT in ANY way a prerequisite!  <br/>
And there's lots more letterboxes in the Montville area (though not <br/>
at the H.S.) such as Milo Light, Chaney Ranch, and all the Nehantic <br/>
SF boxes (all within 15 minutes of the event!). We'll send an email <br/>
or post out the week before the Relay as a reminder.... with date, <br/>
times, directions if there's an interest!   Any questions, comments, <br/>
thoughts, ideas, drop us a line via email:  SHOL3039@aol.com <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting us ramble!<br/>
-Steve and Heidi <br/>
<br/>
PS - Madras will probably be there too (So you'll get some exchanges, <br/>
a traveller and the event stamp!) <br/>
