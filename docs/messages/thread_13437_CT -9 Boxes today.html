and Bluebird for hiding boxes at the nice Walden Preserve in Salem-  <br/>
Carol has one there,too.  All boxes were in fine shape- Butterfly's <br/>
new series is fun.  Toad dog has some new candids available for <br/>
viewing in the photo section in the boxing doggies file. The second <br/>
photo is of him doing his only trick-- retrieving rocks off the <br/>
bottom of the brook. While we were looking for Butterfly's boxes, she <br/>
was finding our new ones at the Honey Tree in Lyme.  What a hoot!!! <br/>
We started our day at Burnham Brook in E. Haddam.  Nice hike- we <br/>
almost missed the box, but retraced our steps and Voila! Add the 7 <br/>
boxes we got on Friday, and all in all, it was a great weekend!!-<br/>
Sunshine,Swamp Yankee, and the Toad dog<br/>
