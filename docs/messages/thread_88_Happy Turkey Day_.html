            Glad you had a nice day. Great to hear you placed two more<br/>
boxes. Have some stamp images to post to you later from my walk last weekend<br/>
(YES IT STOPPED RAINING OVER HERE). Will post them to my web space hopefully<br/>
it will give you all some ideas. Had a good day 12 stamps from the charity<br/>
walk and another 21 extras on the way around. Dont worry they say it's the<br/>
quality thats important not the amount. Rumour has it that it is walking<br/>
weather again this weekend any one care to join me. I have two americans<br/>
visiting on Monday and Tuesday hoping to meet up. Will let you know how i<br/>
get on.<br/>
