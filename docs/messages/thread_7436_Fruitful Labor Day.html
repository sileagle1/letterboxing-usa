day in Cincinnati yesterday :)  Went to Woodland Mound Park and found<br/>
a bunch of boxes.  <br/>
We found Franz's Spring Fever and Pond Life  and 7 of 8 of Team <br/>
Jedi's Jurassic Workout.  It was great fun.  Got a little confused on <br/>
number 7 of the Jedi's.....could not find that box for the life of us.<br/>
<br/>
The trails were absolutely packed yesterday, but we were as discreet <br/>
as we could be....though one little girl told her daddy we were lost <br/>
in the woods when she saw us off of the trail when we were returning <br/>
after replacing a box.<br/>
<br/>
I was cracking up reading the letter from the letterboxing <br/>
Dad....hysterical! I do hope he is recovering :)<br/>
