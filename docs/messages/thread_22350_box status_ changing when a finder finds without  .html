just wondering. Often I have people contact me to say they have found<br/>
a box but do not post on the list to change the status of the box.<br/>
Or, in checking my boxes I find I have had visitors.<br/>
Now I know the box is alive and well, but the finder hasn't gone<br/>
online to declare that. Is there a way I can change the status, thus<br/>
letting others know the box is alive and well?<br/>
I know I can just do it as if I have found it, but that isnt; really<br/>
how it is to be done as it adds to my 'F' count, when I havent found<br/>
it, it is my box.<br/>
I actually did try it once not realizing it would count is as a find<br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
Choi, is there a way I can do this?<br/>
thanks.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] box status, changing when a finder finds without posting<br/>
at LBNA site??<br/>
<br/>
Now I know the box is alive and well, but the finder hasn't gone<br/>
online to declare that. Is there a way I can change the status, thus<br/>
letting others know the box is alive and well?<br/>
==================<br/>
<br/>
You can always add a note in the clue.  The first line of my clues is<br/>
usually "Last checked/found: date".  I started doing this before the status<br/>
feature was added to LBNA, but have kept it in order to update status if<br/>
I've checked on a box recently.<br/>

You can change the status of your own boxes to OK with a date. It's the<br/>
owner's equivilent to Found.<br/>
