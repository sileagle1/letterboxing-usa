                    <div class="plaintext-content">just a note, since many of the recent viruses that have been flying around<br/>
have been attached to files with "pictures" or "pics" or such phrases in the<br/>
subject line, I have made the decision to delete any emails that have<br/>
something of that sort in the subject line without reading them if it isn't<br/>
made clear that the pictures are letterboxing related.<br/>
<br/>
If you are attaching pictures or links to pictures, could you just take a<br/>
moment to label them in a way that makes it obvious that they are<br/>
letterboxing related?  eg. "letterboxing pictures, gathering pictures,<br/>
lovely Molly pictures, " etc.  I suspect I'm not the only one who has grown<br/>
cautious over unlabeled files being sent to me by email with no explanation<br/>
other than "new pictures here."<br/>
<br/>
thanks tons,<br/>
