Also wanted to mention that a few weeks back we signed on board for our third ever <br/>
letterboxing cruise!  We had gone on both Norwegian and Royal Caribbean letterboxing <br/>
cruises before in 2003 and 2005, and discovered that we had just as much fun on the $200 <br/>
cruises as we did on the $1000 ones, so we thought we'd go on just one more!  Well, Pete <br/>
had to opt out, so I decided to go with my letterboxing friend Irene, but just days after we <br/>
signed up, all hell broke loose - wildfires in CA!!!  We got a fantastic price, though: only <br/>
$215.47 with senior discount for a 5-day cruise with all the trimmings from Long Beach to <br/>
San Diego to Catalina Island to Ensenada, Mexico on the "Monarch of the Seas" for Jan.28 - <br/>
Feb 1, so we thought we'd pass that along just in case there were any other parties not <br/>
already otherwise booked that might be interested in joining this exciting little adventure!  <br/>
Let's hope those fires should all have subsided long before that time, but probably because <br/>
of them, I noticed that Royal Caribbean today is offering an additional $75 onboard credit for <br/>
that cruise -something we didn't get- so now there is even more incentive to sign on! Please <br/>
let us know if anyone else might want to go winter cruising in southern California, or maybe <br/>
even just meet up with us for some letterbox magic along the way! Here's to some great <br/>
California dreamin' for Irene's first trip to CA!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, looks like letterboxers have "missed the boat" as far as joining us on our third <br/>
upcoming  letterboxing cruise at those fantastic fares we had mentioned earlier! At last <br/>
glance, it seems that all but a few of the pricier staterooms ( still inexpensive by most <br/>
cruise standards, though) had already been snapped up by other adventurous souls, so <br/>
we'll just have to try to leave some boxes behind for other letterboxers who may be able <br/>
to follow in our footsteps later on! In fact, if anyone would like us to plant or replace a <br/>
box for them during our CA travels, all we ask is that you please keep it small (preferably <br/>
a microbox), and we would be happy to oblige! <br/>
<br/>
Also, we would still be happy to have anyone join us - or take us under their wings! - on <br/>
the land portions of our trip. We'll be pretty busy before the cruise if we rent a car to try <br/>
and go visit my "trail angel" (from my three Mexico to Canada thru-hikes of the Pacific <br/>
Crest Trail in the "80's and 90's), but we'll still have Tuesday (Jan. 29) to box our way <br/>
around the harbor in San Diego, and Friday(Feb. 1) after our cruise to catch some <br/>
letterboxing around LA, if, for example,  anyone might wish to join us and help us <br/>
negotiate our way through the LA transportation system to get to Pointe Vicente <br/>
Lighthouse, the Getty Center,  Griffith Park, or wherever! Suggestions are always <br/>
appreciated, and we hope to actually start looking at a few clues after the holidays, too!<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
