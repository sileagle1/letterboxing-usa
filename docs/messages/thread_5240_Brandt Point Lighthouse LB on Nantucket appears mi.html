one at Brandt Light, we were unable to find it. It is in a high <br/>
traffic area and perhaps someone took it, or there was a storm surge, <br/>
or it was moved, or we totally missed it. We looked on both sides of <br/>
the light in the rocks etc. Any ideas. We did of course find the one <br/>
at Sankaty Light. Thanks again .... Abe 'n Gail<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Location: Nantucket Island, Massachusetts<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Clues:   Easy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Terrain:  Very Easy to Very Difficult<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Distance:   <br/>
&gt; Steamship Wharf to Brandt Point...1 mile<br/>
&gt; Brandt Point to Sankaty Head...10 miles<br/>
&gt; Sankaty Head to Great Point....8 miles<br/>
&gt; Great Point to Steamship Wharf..16 miles    <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are two ways to do these lighthouse letterboxes. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The first is to take two days, rent a bike from Young's Bicycle <br/>
Shop. Get the Brandt Point and Sankaty Head Lighthouse boxes on the <br/>
first day, and the Great Point Lighthouse Letterbox on the second <br/>
day. This involves a great deal of biking and hiking.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The second is to rent a 4 wheel drive jeep from Young's Bicycle <br/>
Shop, and get all three letterboxes in one day. This involves some <br/>
great off road soft sand driving.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>

&gt;  For a History and Photographs of the Lighthouse please visit <br/>
www.lighthouse.cc/brant/index.html<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Clues:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the Steamship Wharf, follow the road to South Beach Road, turn <br/>
right and follow South Beach Road to Easton Road. Turn right and <br/>
follow Easton Road to the end. Lock up your bikes or park the jeep. <br/>
As you came down the road you may have noticed the original <br/>
lighthouse tower. Now make your way down to the lighthouse. The <br/>
letterbox is hidden in the rocks to the right of the door as you face <br/>
the lighthouse. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sankaty Head Light Letterbox<br/>
&gt;  For a History and Photographs of the Lighthouse please visit <br/>
www.lighthouse.cc/sankaty/index.html<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Clues:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From Steamship Wharf follow the road west to South Water Street.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Turn left and follow South Water Street to the end, this is Main <br/>
Street (cobblestones).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Turn right and follow Main Street to Pleasant Street (stop at <br/>
Young's Bicycle Shop to pick up a map. Most of these roads, including <br/>
this one, are missing signs).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Turn left and follow Pleasant Street to the rotary circle. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the other side of the rotary is Milestone Road.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Follow Milestone Road all the way to Siasconset (road becomes Main <br/>
Street in Siasconset).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At the end of Main Street, turn left onto Walsh Road, Polpis Road, <br/>
or Sankaty Avenue (they're all the same).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Follow this road (whichever) to Annes Lane on the right.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Turn right and follow Annes Lane to Atlantic Street.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Turn left and follow Atlantic Street to the Sankaty Head Lighthouse.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The letterbox is hidden among the roots of a small pine on the left <br/>
side of a small asphalt lane (path) to the left of the lighthouse <br/>
gate (heading down towards the golf course).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Great Point Light Letterbox<br/>
&gt; For a History and Photographs of the Lighthouse please visit  <br/>
www.lighthouse.cc/greatpoint/index.html<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Clues:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From Steamship Wharf follow the road west to South Water Street.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Turn left and follow South Water Street to the end, this is Main <br/>
Street (cobblestones).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Turn right and follow Main Street to Pleasant Street (stop at <br/>
Young's Bicycle Shop to pick up a map. Most of these roads, including <br/>
this one, are missing signs).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Turn left and follow Pleasant Street to the rotary circle. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the other side of the rotary is Milestone Road.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Follow Milestone Road toward Siasconset for just a short distance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Take Polpis Road, on your left, towards Quidnet and Wauwinet. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After a while (about 6 miles) take Wauwinet Road, again on your <br/>
left.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At the end of Wauwinet Road you will come to the gatehouse for the <br/>
Wauwinet Resort.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you have arrived here on bicycle, park your bikes, lock them up, <br/>
and take the path in front of you (heading easterly) toward the beach.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once you have reached the beach, turn left. The lighthouse is <br/>
located 6 miles north of here.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you have arrived here in a 4-wheel drive vehicle, proceed <br/>
through the Resort Parking area until you come to a hard packed dirt <br/>
road.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Continue on this road for a short distance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Soon it will be time to deflate your tires to less than 15 psi, and <br/>
to engage the 4-wheel drive.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now the fun begins.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The lighthouse can be found at the end of the soft (very soft) sand <br/>
track.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Keep in the existing ruts and you should be just fine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you should happen to meet another 4-wheel drive vehicle coming <br/>
in the opposite direction... well, I'm sure the two of you can work <br/>
it out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (fyi the air pump required to re-inflate your tires is located on <br/>
the right side of Wauwinet Road, just after the gate house).Once you <br/>
have arrived at the lighthouse, the letterbox can be found beneath <br/>
some stones on the west side, where the tower and the keeper's house <br/>
join. <br/>
