An Add-on to Wanda and Pete’s My Favorite Ornament series<br/>
Burlingame State Park Campground<br/>
Charlestown, Rhode Island<br/>
<br/>
Follow the directions for The My Favorite Ornament series.  Continue on the loop after doing Spring Chick’s Kindergarten Keepsakes and Laurette’s Christmas Tree.  Once through the pine grove the trail becomes bordered by mountain laurels. Just before the trail goes uphill there will be a small clearing on the left and you will see a large laurel bush next to a rock.  Crouch under the laurel to find Grace hiding beneath bark and sticks between the laurel and the rock.<br/>

A NIGHT TO REMEMBER<br/>
<br/>
The week of July 12, 1996 we went camping with our Boy Scout Troop at Burlingame. The camping was fun and uneventful until that Friday night. We were monitoring hurricane Bertha coming up the eastern seaboard to see whether we should stay the night.  Being brave Boy Scouts, we stayed. That night it rained around 6 inches. We were floating on our air mattresses inside our tents by daybreak. The roads were flooded and we were soaked. That morning they closed the camp down and told us to pack up. Being obedient Scouts, we did.  Being loyal Scouts, that memorable campout became the first of our now 8th annual Family Campout at Burlingame.<br/>
