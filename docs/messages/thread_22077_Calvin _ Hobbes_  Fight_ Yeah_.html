<br/>
Calvin: Hobbes, Hobbes!  Come quick.  Fight behind the school! <br/>
Hobbes:  Are there snacks?<br/>
Calvin: Hurry before it burns out!<br/>
Hobbes:  So much yelling.  There are more explanation marks than a <br/>
Mark Trail comic.  What's causing all the excitement?<br/>
Calvin:  Who cares!  Wow it's a huge flame war.  This is great!  <br/>
Hobbes:  We tigers bite and claw.  You people should be more <br/>
advanced.  Pfbbbbtt!<br/>
Calvin:  But this is so fun to watch.  See two people misunderstand <br/>
each other and hurt each other's feelings without realizing it, <br/>
right?  Then, all defensive, they respond angrily like animals.  <br/>
Grrrrrrrrr!  <br/>
Hobbes: Why don't they just bite?<br/>
Calvin: That's the best part.  They can't, so they just yell <br/>
louder.  Wow this is loud one.  Only Susie's louder than this.<br/>
Hobbes:  You shouldn't have put that down her back.<br/>
Calvin: Watch, now people take sides and unwittingly fan the <br/>
flames.   Quick, hand me that water hose.<br/>
Hobbes: You mean no matter what they say now it only adds to the <br/>
fire? Even if we were nice and furry?  [Big toothy grin.]<br/>
Calvin: Yep.  It reaches critical mass and will burn ANYTHING no <br/>
matter WHAT you say.  The hose! The hose!  Quick!  Hurry before it <br/>
burns itself out!  <br/>
Hobbes:  But doesn't that mean that we, um, us... we're fanning it <br/>
too! [Runs for hose.]<br/>
Calvin:  Yep.  Isn't it great!  Turn the water on full. <br/>
Hobbes:  Oh my goshes we better do something.  Will the water put it <br/>
out?  [Turning tap to full.]<br/>
Calvin: Heck no. It only makes them madder and I'm gonna make em <br/>
more mud! Wheeeeeeee! Hey! Gimme back that hose! <br/>
Hobbes:  You can't make me.  Pfffbbbbttttt!  [Rolling on the ground <br/>
in fur flying tussle.]  Mud won't stick to Tiger fur. <br/>
Pfffbbbbbtttttt.<br/>
Calvin:  Oh no, I forgot! We got to get out of here before it ends!<br/>
Hobbes:  Why, grownups will break it up?<br/>
Calvin: When these things burn out then all the mushy apologies <br/>
start.  Ewwwwwwwwww.  Grossssss!<br/>
Hobbes: Are there smooches?  [Big toothy grin.]<br/>
Calvin: Runnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!<br/>
