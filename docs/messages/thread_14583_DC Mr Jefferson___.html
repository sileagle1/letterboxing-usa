sorry.  But I fanned the log pages out in the hot sun for as long as I could <br/>
stand it before putting them back.  Only 2 stamps inside are intact, not <br/>
including mine; the rest (if there were any; it's hard to tell) got soaked <br/>
and ran.  There are a few clean pages, but the "title" page and a couple of <br/>
others fell off the ribbon.<br/>
<br/>
The baggie has tiny holes in it and is pretty beat up.  I'd recommend <br/>
double-bagging since the box itself is not waterproof.  Thanks for a nice <br/>
walk, Forest Frog Family!<br/>
