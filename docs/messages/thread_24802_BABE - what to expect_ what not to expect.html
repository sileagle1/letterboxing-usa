<br/>
  (Also, if you did not register for BABE ((Birth of American Boxing Event)) but are coming and would like us to grill something for you - options are burger, veggie burger, hotdog, shishkabob with or without chicken - let me know how many of each.  A separate committee is coordinating sides, and it's BYOB.)<br/>
  ----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
  Hi you guys, y'all, and you 'uns:<br/>
<br/>
BABE, the Birth of American Boxing Event, was conceived as a commemoration of ten years of a beautiful, simple, fun way to get out in the fresh air and find hand-carved art in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
The hunt and the find are, to me, the essence of letterboxing....and that's what my events tend to be about.<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing most of us have been to or hosted gatherings before. It's possible many, or even most, gatherings have common elements that people have come to expect. You might presume BABE will have some or all of these elements.<br/>
<br/>
Surely people will be hiking, boxing, eating, exchanging, driving, rafting, snoozing, playing music, biking, flying kites, planting cooties, geocaching, drinking, soaking in a hot tub, and/or just exploring Hot Springs.<br/>
<br/>
As to if and when these activities happen, that is entirely up to you who attend. That is why there is no schedule.<br/>
<br/>
The USFS day use area is small, and that is another reason there is no schedule; we can't all fit there at once. <br/>
<br/>
There will be food available all day for those who order it ahead of time (see the event calendar), and there will be a cootie-free zone (again, see the event calendar).<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, how and when things happen is anybody's guess. Hopefully the spirit of Hot Springs - go with the flow - will suit you, 'cuz that's what it's all about. <br/>
  -----------------------------------<br/>
  A lot of us are looking forward to meeting a lot of you!<br/>
