success.<br/>
<br/>
Excitedly found these letterboxes alive &amp; well:<br/>
<br/>
Orion--DC<br/>
Ghost from the Titanic--DC<br/>
Fortress Marcy--VA<br/>
Inlingua--VA<br/>
A Flower for Mildred--VA<br/>
<br/>
Failed to find:<br/>
Hal &amp; the Magic Mushroom--DC<br/>
Gulf Branch--VA<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if these are missing or if we just goose-egged both.  Both <br/>
areas had MAJOR devastation.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for several more great letterboxes!!!  See you along the <br/>
trails...<br/>

home across the continent early tomorrow.  Here are the last few <br/>
boxes we found during today's trek:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Lion LB (Springfield, VA)--alive &amp; well<br/>
**The Witch LB was missing  :(<br/>
&amp; The Wardrobe LB--alive &amp; well<br/>
<br/>
Hidden Pond (Springfield, VA)<br/>
--all 3 LBs alive &amp; well<br/>
<br/>
W &amp; OD Trail LB (Arlington, VA)--alive &amp; well<br/>
Glen Carlyn Dog LB--alive &amp; well<br/>
<br/>
Mr Bow Wow--alive &amp; well<br/>
5133--alive &amp; well<br/>
2003--alive &amp; well<br/>
<br/>
Mother Goose (Annandale, VA)--missing<br/>
<br/>
All in all a wonderful trek--added 52 letterbox stamps to our <br/>
collection, countless exchanges with other really cool area <br/>
letterboxers &amp; surpassed F700 &amp; PFX1000 somewhere along the trail in <br/>
the process!  Despite being in the area for almost a month, we only <br/>
really had about 7 days in which to letterbox--but what an adventure <br/>
those 7 days revealed.  We walked through marshes, riverbeds, <br/>
historical trails, parks, cityscapes, waterfronts, urban areas, <br/>
gorgeous estate gardens, zoological gardens, frozen lakes/ponds, <br/>
embassy neighborhoods--you name it!  We saw so many wonderful things <br/>
that we would never have known about had it not been for this <br/>
interesting hobby.  It is amazing that so many letterboxes survived <br/>
Hurricane Isabel--we observed so much devastation throughout this <br/>
trek it's absolutely incredible that some of these boxes were still <br/>
intact!  We came across so many large old trees literally reduced to <br/>
splinters and twisted shells of once grand wonders.  Wow! We're <br/>
awestruck!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, DC area letterbox planters, for encouraging us to explore <br/>
some really neat and interesting places &amp; for planting such <br/>
incredible letterboxes, to boot!<br/>
<br/>
See you along the letterboxing trails...<br/>
