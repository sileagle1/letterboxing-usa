                    <div class="plaintext-content">I like dealing with Mountain Heritage Crafters (google for their web <br/>
addy because it is a tad complex).<br/>
<br/>
My favorite non-Speedball carving tools are my Dockyard Micro-Carving <br/>
gouges ($42.99), the Dockyard 1.5 mm Micro-carving set ($38.99), and <br/>
the Two Cherries 0.5 mm gouge (~$40 by itself). If you get one of the <br/>
Dockyard sets, consider buying a denim roll to keep the tools sharp <br/>
and your body safe.<br/>
<br/>
These all have smaller wooden handles and are easier to grip. Some of <br/>
the tools offer a sweep to the tool (instead of straight) which <br/>
aligns the blade with the carving surface. I did not opt for that. <br/>
Might be something to try.<br/>
<br/>
Other options might be new blades for the Speedball and a free-<br/>
standing illuminating magnifier. Wish I had that right now, he said <br/>
squinting.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing, even with all my tools, Ms. Mouse outcarves me in all <br/>
ways with her Speedball set. Hand-eye coordination and patience does <br/>
pay off.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I got some of the plumbers' gasket material. Thanks! Had to have <br/>
one guy hunt all over the store in Home Depot but we found it. I <br/>
think it should hold a line nicely.<br/>
