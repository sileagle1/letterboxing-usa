I have just been introduced to this wonderful pastime through our<br/>
local library,which ran four "quests" this summer...They are all<br/>
finished now ,and i have looked on the web for others near me,but he<br/>
one's listed are not very near.I even looked into geocaching,and found<br/>
many more of them with in a accessible radius of my home ,but without<br/>
a pocket magellen ,they seem a difficult find.This leads me to some<br/>
questions ,are there are tips you could give on doing these without<br/>
such gadgetry...also what is the oldest box you ever found..it occured<br/>
to me that these might lst for years ...go orphaned even.I read that<br/>
this started with a man in England back in mid 1800's,who hid<br/>
letterboxes out on the moor,and i wondered if some of the originals<br/>
where still there?I'm thinking of starting a club with some of<br/>
co-workers ,who also have fallen in love with this sport to create our<br/>
own quests for ouselves(others would be welcome to search of<br/>
course)but because there seem to be a serious lack of close by quests<br/>
...i get so jealous when i read your posts and learn about the<br/>
tens...no hundreds of boxes in ct,ma,nh all tantilizingly just out of<br/>
reach(vacation? what is that.We,slaves don't have the slightest clue<br/>
.lol)<br/>

</p><p>I have read many times, "If you plant them, they will come!" and there seems to be some truth to that. Geocaching is more popular in some areas than letterboxing...and vice versa. Don't know why.
</p><p>Why not plant some boxes in your area with your friends and post your clues here and see what happens.You might be surprised by what your efforts can do when others discover how enjoyable and healthy letterboxing is. If you aren't sure of how to put the various bits and pieces of a letterbox together, make sure you read the LBNA FAQ's and ask questions from the letterboxers here. Newcomers are welcome! Good luck!

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I can certainly understand where you are coming from.  When I first <br/>
became interested in letterboxing, the closest box to my home (in <br/>
West Michigan) was 2 hours away...  2 boxes.  The few others in the <br/>
state were all at least 3 hours away, most on the other side of the <br/>
state.<br/>
<br/>
But there are two sides to this game...  finding the boxes and <br/>
planting the boxes.  Not being in a position to participate very <br/>
actively in the finding, I have made it my mission to plant as many <br/>
boxes as possible.  Not only does this give me the enjoyment of <br/>
participating in the hobby, but also I would hope that as people hear <br/>
about it and interest grows (and believe me, I tell everyone...), <br/>
people will not be discouraged by the lack of boxes in this area, as <br/>
I initially was.  I have noticed that it also makes this area appear <br/>
to be alive in terms of letterboxing, and just within the past month, <br/>
several people have planted boxes as they passed through on vacation -<br/>
- boxes that I can now find!<br/>
<br/>
There is also an advantage being in a area with fewer boxes -- lots <br/>
of great hiding places just waiting for a box!  Finding these places, <br/>
creating a stamp and box theme, writing the clues...  these are all <br/>
very enjoyable aspects of the hobby for me.  And yes, I do believe <br/>
that if you plant them, they will come...  and I intend to be ready!<br/>
