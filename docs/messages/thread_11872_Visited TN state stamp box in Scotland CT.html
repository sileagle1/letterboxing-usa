Wildlife Refuge today. Got to the box just as it started raining so please<br/>
excuse me that I only stamped in and left no note. I do want everyone to<br/>
know that the box is in fine condition, put together well, a nice stamp, and<br/>
good clues. Most of all, I was reminded of the excellent view. Molly and I<br/>
have been in this Nature Conservancy area many times, even before we started<br/>
letterboxing. We always enjoyed it here. Very nice trails, and from the area<br/>
of this Tennessee state coin box is the best scenic view in this refuge.<br/>
Excellent place to place a letterbox. Good job Needeeps!.....Chuck and Molly<br/>
