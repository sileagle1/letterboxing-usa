At least four tornados have touched down, and there's a lot of damage around.  My personal abode is fine, but I'll be cleaning branches and helping neighbors for the next few days.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, if you have sent me boxes to be assigned to you, then it might be a few days until I get to them.  Also, site changes will be forthcoming, but not immediately. <br/>
<br/>
Please have patience.<br/>

Thanks.<br/>
