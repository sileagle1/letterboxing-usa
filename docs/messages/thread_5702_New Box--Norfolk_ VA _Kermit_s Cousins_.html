Box Name:  "Kermit's Cousins"<br/>
Location:  Virginia, Norfolk<br/>
<br/>
This is a lovely place just outside of Norfolk's Botanical Gardens.  In <br/>
addition to the handmade "Kermit's Cuz" stamp, there's a surprise for the <br/>
little tadpoles in your group!  Hope you have as much fun finding it as we <br/>
had placing it.  <br/>
<br/>
Our frogs await the intrepid<br/>
In the silence, the gloaming, of the wood.<br/>
Do you dare to find them?<br/>
A reward waits, if you should.<br/>
<br/>
Take the road named for a garden,<br/>
To the garden for which it is named.<br/>
Just south of the entrance, find a duck pond<br/>
In oak and loblolly framed.<br/>
<br/>
A drive leaves the road's east side<br/>
It's this narrow drive you should take.<br/>
It dead-ends in a grassy lot<br/>
Where footpaths fan out for the lake.<br/>
<br/>
Just one will feel hard underfoot,<br/>
Just one runs flat and smooth.<br/>
A yellow gate stands at its mouth.<br/>
This path alone is true.<br/>
<br/>
Follow this path into the trees<br/>
Among maples and pines all 'round<br/>
Up ahead, a sharp left turn.<br/>
As you round it, start to count.<br/>
<br/>
Fifty-five paces past the curve<br/>
A second gate, green, looms ahead<br/>
And off to your left, 'twixt green swamp and ferns,<br/>
Lies a toppled tree, long dead.<br/>
<br/>
Its roots are a circle reaching wide<br/>
Like the rays of the golden sun<br/>
In the orb's center, a darkened cleft<br/>
Reach in; your search is done.<br/>
<br/>
The box is crowded, we'll admit<br/>
So please take a little friend<br/>
To remind you of this day we shared<br/>
A quest, and a happy end.<br/>
<br/>
Clues written by our dear friend:  "The Mer-Man"<br/>
