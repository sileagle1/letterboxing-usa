                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone!  In preparation for hiding more letterboxes next week, I've <br/>
been doing some stamp carving and have tried a new eraser that to my mind is <br/>
the best one so far.  It's called Colorific Rub-A-Way Eraser by Sanford (and <br/>
is a beautiful turquoise color).  It's designed for erasing away charcoal <br/>
and therefore is very hard and dense. That makes it a little harder to carve <br/>
(I'd say the technique more closely resembles gouging than carving), but as <br/>
a result it is also more "forgiving"--accidental nicks in the wrong <br/>
direction don't spell disaster for your design!  It holds ink and stamps up <br/>
as well as other erasers I've used (which include Magic Rub and Art Gum).<br/>
<br/>
With luck, I'll have 3 new boxes placed next week!  And hope to find at <br/>
least one...<br/>

That's the same one I've been using for the most part<br/>
too.  I also like that it's thick enough to not need<br/>
any backing.<br/>

Oh, the P10F7 is that "letterbox quotient" that got<br/>
started a while ago.  It stands for Placed 10 and<br/>
Found 7.  <br/>

 I've found the same erasers in my local arts &amp; crafts stores. I agree, they<br/>
carve well. Most of my boxes and personal stamp (both sides) were made with<br/>

Foods, a grocery store local in Green Bay, has them.  This is a lesson<br/>
well learned.  I like the pink pet erasers myself.  Granted they need<br/>

out backs either.  My dad helps me with the saw and it turns out to be<br/>
quality time between him and me.  Die xoxo<br/>

&gt;any store that sells erasers and containers will have what you are<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I had the same problem. I couldn't find the "recommended" materials<br/>
(Staedtler Mars ). I think it was Marty who steered me to<br/>
http://www.investorsnet.com/stampeaz/ for Pz-Kut. We have several arts &amp;<br/>
crafts stores near where I live. Only one had linoleum cutters, and another<br/>
one had the green Rub-A Way's.<br/>
