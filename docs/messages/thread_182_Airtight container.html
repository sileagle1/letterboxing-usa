Might I suggest the Long Tall Jar from American Science and Surplus?<br/>
<br/>
I used these on my last two letterboxes because they are the closest<br/>
thing I've found to the "pill jars" being used in Dartmoor.  They<br/>
are slightly smaller in diameter.  The pill jars are 3" and these are<br/>
only 2 1/2".  But they have the advantage of a hermetic seal.  They<br/>
are also transparent.  If your stamp's smallest dimension is less<br/>
than 2 1/2" I would suggest trying these.  They are only .50 ea.<br/>
Compare that to 2.00+ for a tupperware or rubbermaid container.<br/>
Also, a small Mead spiral bound notebook fits neatly inside with<br/>
just a slight bend along its vertical axis.  Pencil fits OK too.<br/>
<br/>
These would be a good choice if you decide to plug because they<br/>
are small and round and would fit neatly inside a hole.  <br/>
<br/>
If you want to anchor the jar (like I did because mine are in a flood plane) you<br/>
can tie a piece of fish line to the jar (beneath where the lid screws on) and<br/>
then tie the other end of the fish line to a tree or rock.  A letterbox secured<br/>
this way will not wander off from natural forces and I don't think rocks,<br/>
animals or falling trees will damage it either.  These jars are quite sturdy.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the description right from their advertising blurb:<br/>
<br/>
Long Tall Jar                  Wide mouth 16 oz. plastic bottle,<br/>
                               5-3/4" high x 2-3/4" dia. (with a 2-1/2"<br/>
                               ID mouth, in case you've got some<br/>
                               23/8" dia. discs to stash). The<br/>
                               bottles/jars are that transparent white<br/>
                               not-quite-clear color, and the lids come<br/>
                               in a variety of solid colors (we choose<br/>
                               which you get). Look like a good<br/>
                               choice for storing powders or granules<br/>
                               or pellets. <br/>
                               ITEM NAME: Plastic Jar, 16 oz.<br/>
                               PRICE: $2.00/pkg(4)<br/>
                               STOCK NUMBER: 26752<br/>

I hope this will be a solution for those of you who are worried about<br/>
damaged or leaky containers. <br/>
<br/>
They are priced 4 for $2.00 and the minimum order is $10.00.<br/>
So I got 20 jars for $10.00. If you want to try one and don't want<br/>
to spend $10.00 for 20 jars, or if you don't want to wait for your<br/>
order to go through (which may take several weeks), just let me know<br/>
and I will give you one.  I have 18 of them left.  I can probably<br/>
get one to you in 3 or 4 days using 4th class mail.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The way I do it is to put the stamp, logbook, etc in a ziploc<br/>
bag; put that in a #5 rubbermaid container; then put that in<br/>
a #6 rubbermaid container.  It makes for a rather bulky <br/>
footprint to try and hide, but it does keep the important<br/>
innards as dry as a bone.  It also is a bit easier to find,<br/>
meaning if you are accurate in following the clues, you will<br/>
find it.  One of my fears is someone accurately following the<br/>
clues, and not finding it because it is too small.<br/>
<br/>
Yet another approach, FWIW :-)<br/>

	I guess I'd like to try one of these. I've been resisting these as they<br/>
seemed too small to hold a nice book without extreem bending, but  they<br/>
seem to have enough other positives that it'd be worth the look.<br/>
<br/>
I've been partial to the Rubbermaid-beige lid type that Marty<br/>
mentionhink the cheapie that was mentioned is likely a Zip-Lok product -<br/>
our fridge has a bunch, and I'd been wondering....<br/>
<br/>
A while back I did broach the idea of the pill container to my<br/>
pharmacist - he didn't have anything that seemed to work.<br/>
