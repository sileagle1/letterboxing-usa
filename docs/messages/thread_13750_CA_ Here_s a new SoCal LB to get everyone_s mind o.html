                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, it's time to get everyone's mind out of the gutter and back to <br/>
complaining about letterboxing sites.  I've just planted a new <br/>
letterbox that requires a very strenuous hike.  It's a 2.7 mile hike <br/>
up into the San Gabrial Mountains north of Pasadena, California, on a <br/>
trail with no shade, planted at the beginning of the hottest months <br/>
in Southern California (there's also that 2.7 mile hike back down the <br/>
mountain to your car).  Anyone attempting to find this letterbox in <br/>
the next 4 months is crazy (bring plenty of water, sunscreen, and a <br/>
hat).  Here are the clues posted on the LBNA:<br/>
<br/>
Distance:  5.4 miles round trip<br/>
Difficulty:  Very Strenuous.  This trip requires a 2.7 mile hike up <br/>
the historic Mount Wilson Toll Road, and then a 2.7 mile return by <br/>
the same routeno public vehicles are allowed.  The toll road itself <br/>
is a 12-foot wide, well-graded dirt road, but it travels very steeply <br/>
up into the San Gabrial Mountains, and there is no shade until you <br/>
reach Henninger Flats; because of this, you should only make this <br/>
trip early in the morning, or when the weather is cool.  This trail <br/>
passes through a rugged wilderness area, so watch for rattlesnakes, <br/>
wear sunscreen and a hat, and bring water.  Henninger Flats is open 7 <br/>
days a week, and hiking is allowed from sunrise to sunset.<br/>
<br/>
Directions travelling west:  Take the West 210 Freeway to Pasadena <br/>
and exit on Sierra Madre Blvd./San Marino.  Turn slight left onto <br/>
Maple Street.  Take Maple a few blocks to Altadena Drive.  Turn right <br/>
on North Altadena Drive for 2.7 miles to Crescent Drive.  Turn right <br/>
on Crescent and right again on Pinecrest Drive to find the entrance <br/>
to the trail.  You'll need to park out on Crescent.  Observe the <br/>
parking signs carefully.<br/>
<br/>
Directions travelling east:  Take the East 210 Freeway to Pasadena <br/>
and exit on Sierra Madre Blvd./Altadena Drive.  Stay straight to go <br/>
onto Corson Street for one block to Altadena Drive.  Turn left onto <br/>
North Altadena Drive for 2.7 miles to Crescent Drive.  Turn right on <br/>
Crescent and right again on Pinecrest Drive to find the entrance to <br/>
the trail.  You'll need to park out on Crescent.  Observe the parking <br/>
signs carefully.<br/>
<br/>
Henninger Flats is a pine-shaded area that has a rich history.  It <br/>
was originally homesteaded in 1880 by William K. Henninger who <br/>
planted hay, melons, corn, and fruit trees in his "farm in the <br/>
clouds."  After harvesting his crop, he would pack the produce down <br/>
the steep trail he built to Eaton Canyon, and beyond to markets in <br/>
Pasadena and Los Angeles.  This trail later became part of the Mount <br/>
Wilson Toll Road, and from 1891 until 1938 it was one of the few <br/>
trails into the San Gabrials.  In 1917, Chinese laborers widened the <br/>
Toll Road to its present size to allow the passage of the 100-inch <br/>
Hooker telescope on its way up to the Mount Wilson Observatory.  This <br/>
was the largest telescope in the world until the 1947, 200-inch Hale <br/>
Telescope on Mount Palomar.  Bottles of Japanese sake have been found <br/>
along the trail that date from this time period.  Since 1928, the <br/>
Flats have served as a high-elevation experimental conifer nursery <br/>
for the Forest Service.  20,000 trees are grown yearly at the nursery <br/>
for use in the reforestation of burned areas, soil erosion control, <br/>
and roadside stabilization.  Many of the early trees in Los Angeles' <br/>
Griffith Park came from seedlings grown on Henninger.  <br/>
<br/>
Camping, firewood, wood stoves, horse corral and flush toilets are <br/>
all free of charge to the public (camping and fire permits are <br/>
required, so please call (626) 794-0675 for information).  There is a <br/>
Visitor's Center with exhibits and photographs showing the history of <br/>
the Mount Wilson Toll Road and the local mountains.  A County <br/>
Forester is on duty 24 hours a day.  No motorized vehicles are <br/>
allowed.<br/>
<br/>
SPECIAL NOTE:  Please make this trip primarily to enjoy the <br/>
historically rich hike, and the visit to Henninger Flats; otherwise, <br/>
you may be very disappointed should you happen to find my letterbox <br/>
missing after that long, hot climb.  <br/>
