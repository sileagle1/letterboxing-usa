                    <div class="plaintext-content">Where are you coming from? I have two series minutes from I-95, easy to get off and back on. In DE "What a Long Strange Trip It's Been" is 10 minutes off of I-95 and has had a fair amount of visitors and are succesfully found (although someone last weekend couldn't find the Dancing Bear which really surprised me 'cause everyone says that's the easiest box of the three).<br/>
<br/>
Another sereies "Treasue Hunt" is 5 minutes off of I-95 in Bensalem, PA. Again, good traffic and very high success rate. The only challenge here is that you MUST copy and paste the tide chart included on the clue page into your browser to check low tides for the date you want to hunt. The box is best searched within two hours of a low tide, otherwise there is no beach for you to walk on.<br/>
<br/>
I-95 Southbound in PA at the first rest stop in Pa after entering from NJ Cyclonic has a very easy box. Also, visit Mark Pepe's website as he has created a page for I-95 boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps, safe journey.<br/>

<br/>
Coming from Florida, and South Florida at that, so I'm covering the whole <br/>
east coast.   Thanks for the recommendations.   I'll add them to the stack of <br/>
clues I have.   I have them divided into smaller stacks, separated by location.   <br/>
If my husband saw them all in one pile, he'd have a heart attack!<br/>

visit Bird Park in Walpole, MA.  It is just a few minutes off I-95 <br/>
and the boxes there are all pretty easy to get to.  <br/>
Here is the website of the park for more info.<br/>

Also not too far off I-95 in Sharon, MA is Moosehill Wildlife <br/>
