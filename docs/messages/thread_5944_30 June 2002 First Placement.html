Stamp is in box located in tree stump near the Pioneer Mother Statue. <br/>
(A woman atop a horse with another horse and two men beside her. This <br/>
statue is near the flag pole at the Liberty Memorial entrance and of <br/>
another statue of a lone soldier. The soldiers pointing his rifle in <br/>
the direction you'll need to look. The stump is in view behind the <br/>
last horse in the statue.<br/>
Between Union Station and the Liberty Memorial for World War One there <br/>
are 5 uniformed military bears, the 2nd box with sketch stamp pad is <br/>
under the middle bear, if you don't want the exercise of walking the <br/>
stamp back to the 1st box location then leave it there and hopefully <br/>
another more energenitic letter boxer will take it back to the first <br/>
box.<br/>
First one to the stamp box will find a secret box inside, you may <br/>
choose to keep it but I would prefer you leave it for the next person <br/>
to see. <br/>
I would appreciate any feedback on difficulty or fun in locating <br/>
either of the boxes. This is a very public place so please be discreet <br/>
in removing the boxes from their hiding spaces and enjoy the park and <br/>
surrounding area while your there.<br/>
