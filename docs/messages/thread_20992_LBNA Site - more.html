I'm not sure if all the chatter re removing missing boxes was a direct result of the <br/>
overloaded system and/or my discovery of the letterbox-basement.<br/>
<br/>
If my two cents is worth anything today, I'd like so say 6 months without a response is <br/>
really not that much time.  I've been letterboxing since April and I am so addicted that I <br/>
can imagine others not having the time to check all their boxes at every inquiry.  I am too <br/>
busy looking for more or planting more.  My boxes are at least 45 minutes from home and <br/>
many more on the horizon that will be hours away.  I might not be able to check on them <br/>
within a 6-month time frame.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of whining about these missing boxes here, perhaps an specific inquiry to a <br/>
regional talklist would be in order.  Likely, sitreps are there, or local letterboxers with <br/>
updates.<br/>
<br/>
Any more ideas?<br/>

Miss Moon - please let me say I was in no way making a personal attack on your position <br/>
or insinuating that you were whining.  I thought I was speaking in general.  I was hoping <br/>
there was an obvious solution that I was overlooking and that someone would enlighten <br/>
us.  I do agree with your position the stagnant boxes should not be on the active list.  <br/>
Perhaps the webmasters might add a function that would allow the box planters one <br/>
mouse-click to put the letterbox(es) into the basement, and attaching a note when the <br/>
box(es) would likely be reactivated.  The concientious and active letterboxers would <br/>
probably clear up most of their own stagnant boxes.  We'll never get 100% compliance, <br/>
and thank goodness.  I would miss some pretty beautiful places.  I have about an 89% <br/>
finding rate at this point, which I find totally acceptable.  <br/>
<br/>
I would have time to maintain my own plantings.  I have had some already go missing and <br/>
they are not on the list.  I have also recarved two stamps.  I send an email to the placer <br/>
after every find with a report.  Some thank me, some don't.  I have started to place my <br/>
boxes at www.atlasquest.com as well.  Some people are very social and others wish for <br/>
mystery.  I think I would choose not look for more boxes by the same planter if I could not <br/>
find their boxes and they wouldn't return an email.  I can understand the frustration.  <br/>
Perhaps you can spend some time planting more boxes closer to home and others will <br/>
sprout soon.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Thanksgiving!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Maybe planting HHs instead of boxes if they are far away from home might be a <br/>
good idea.  You can keep track of the HH if you want  via e-mails or the HH <br/>
web site. This way the letterbox site might  not have so many unchecked boxes. <br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

I just have this vision of the site crashing one of these days due to overload. Even with us saving our clues, it would still be a huge pain. <br/>
<br/>
I agree with what someone said, that the clues for active boxes should be available for all of us for years to come. But I get annoyed when I get responses like that one I pointed out, from the person who told me they knew it was missing and since they were visiting the area, they had no plans to replace it. I just don't get why they would be so inconsiderate as to leave it on the site. I'm sure those people and boxes are a minority but it can still be annoying. <br/>

Happy Thanksgiving to you also!<br/>
