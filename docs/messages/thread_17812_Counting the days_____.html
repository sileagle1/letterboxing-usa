                    <div class="plaintext-content">....i get home from work, chase my three-year-old around the car, <br/>
then hold her tightly by the collar of her coat while i fumble with <br/>
my keys and unlock the door, when lo and behold Martha (Counting the <br/>
days) is waiting for me!  Martha was NOT very happy with me.  <br/>
<br/>
First, upon arrival to my home she notices my handmade, crooked, <br/>
crosstich plaque that says "Marth Stewart does NOT live here."<br/>
<br/>
Then she notices that my daughter's toys are found in the living <br/>
room, along with the homemade "round-n-round" (a heavy duty round <br/>
clothes basked attached to a lazy-susan mechanism that my husband <br/>
made for my daughter. they LOVE to play with it...but does it HAVE <br/>
to stay in the living room?), in addition to toys in the downstairs <br/>
family room AND in my daughter's room.<br/>
<br/>
Poor Martha couldn't decide where to sit since the old formica <br/>
dining table I have is surrounded by 4 old, squeaky, oak chairs, one <br/>
of which has a split bottom (we keep it in the corner where no one <br/>
would sit anyway). I mean how could I match a metal/formica table <br/>
with WOODEN chairs?  Martha was dumbfounded. The flooring in the <br/>
kitchen is the original floor installed in 1986 and is in bad need <br/>
of replacement, but I try to explain to her that I am the primary <br/>
provider for the family, we have two car payments, daycare, . . . . <br/>
then I notice that she's not listening.  Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
Dinner was a total disaster.  Tuesday is "free-for-all" dinner at my <br/>
house.  You can eat whatever you want as long as it's nutritious.  <br/>
Maggie had yogurt, peanut butter and jelly, and raisins with juice.  <br/>
I planned to have a simple pasta and veggie mix that I invented <br/>
while in college.  Martha wasn't pleased that I didn't plan 2 days <br/>
ahead and prepare a luscious leg of lamb or Portuguese pot roast!  <br/>
She settled for a bowl of Cheerios and an apple with a glass of <br/>
milk.  My husband came in around 7 and finished off the tuna <br/>
casserole from the refrigerator with a boiled egg, saltine crackers <br/>
and a pop.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the night I didn't see Martha since I was busy with <br/>
kitchen cleaning, clothes, and attending to my daughter (bath, brush <br/>
teeth, quiet time, book time, bed time).  <br/>
<br/>
When I woke up this morning Martha was packed and sitting on her <br/>
suitcase next to the front door. She had called a limosine to pick <br/>
her up.  By the time I had finished getting myself dressed, fed the <br/>
dogs, and got my daughter up and dressed, Martha was gone.  Guess <br/>
middle-class living isn't a "GOOD THING" in Martha's book.<br/>

I really liked your post.  Though I don't have any kids (just dogs), <br/>
I do have a wife who struggles with her inner-Martha.<br/>
