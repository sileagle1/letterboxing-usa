history and weaponry, and chose to spend his special day exploring the<br/>
Springfield Armory in Springfield, MA.  While there, we placed our first<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Birthday with a Bang letterbox<br/>
placed November 29, 2001, at the Springfield Armory<br/>
Springfield, MA<br/>
Easy, less than 1/2 hour<br/>
<br/>
The armory is free, with a donation box near the door.  Half of it is<br/>
exhibits showing the history of the weapons made there, and the other<br/>
half is exhibits about the industrial revolution as it pertains to<br/>
firearms production.  Even for a peacemonger like me, it's very<br/>
interesting!  My favorite display was the black powder rifle hit by<br/>
lightning, leaving the barrel in a spiral formation!<br/>
<br/>
Travel northwest around armory.<br/>
Continue counterclockwise around paved circle toward the Magnificent<br/>
Mansion.<br/>
Pass two bright sentries on your right.<br/>
Line up as if to lead the sentries marching down the hill.<br/>
At 250 degrees, a medium size tree blocks your view of a grand tree 2/3<br/>
of the way down the hill.<br/>
Birthday with a Bang letterbox is cozy in the backside of the base of<br/>
this grand tree.<br/>

&gt; You two should check out the Higgins Armory in Worchester too. They <br/>
&gt; have a great medieval collection.<br/>
<br/>
We went there a couple of years ago, on a day when they had a real live<br/>
person walking around in one of the suits of armor!  Pure joy for my son!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If anybody does go to the Birthday with a Bang box, I'd appreciate it if<br/>
you could find a flat rock to put on it or otherwise cover it up better<br/>
than we did.  It was raining and cold and yucky when we were there, so we<br/>
didn't take as much time to camouflage it as we would have otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to take three munchkins to the Ecotarium in Worcester today<br/>
and then visit Leominster's Native Son #7 letterbox, with the xmas<br/>
display carved by a 91 y.o. gentleman!<br/>

count these buggers up!)<br/>
