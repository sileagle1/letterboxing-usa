Need carving stuff - just ask justbeth!!!!<br/>
She sold me 22 sheets (6x12) of the "Pink Stuff" and a set of safety <br/>
Speedball carvers that I had never seen before, at a really great price.  She will be <br/>
my supplier from now on.  Also, I am thinking of taking her on all my Lb <br/>
hikes,  ; )  she said the last time she was boxing was at The Gerbil Gathering in <br/>
May - Well let me tell you she hasn't lost her touch. Me in totally wrong spot, <br/>
looking for half hour - I hear Beth "I FOUND IT, I FOUND IT!! " and see her <br/>
doing a little dance on top of the stone wall.  Thanks Beth.  Well, I better <br/>
get carving, so much Pink Stuff, so little time, lol.<br/>
