Please bring a stamp pad (box does not have one) and pencil.  The box <br/>
is located in the Lake Alma State Park outside Wellston, Ohio.  To <br/>
get there, take S.R.#93 north from Wellston and turn onto S.R. #349 <br/>
just outside of town.  S.R. #349 will lead you a couple of miles out <br/>
past the water plant and across the dam that forms Lake Alma.  (You'd <br/>
never guess that 100 years ago the island had an amusement park and <br/>
interurban trains brought people from Columbus and elsewhere to relax <br/>
here!)  After you cross the dam, the park loop road turns off to the <br/>
right past the park office and the swimming beach.  Make your way to <br/>
the Shady Hollow shelterhouse.  With your back to the shelterhouse, <br/>
stand in front of the grill on the east end and take a bearing of <br/>
96.  You should see a large tree at the top of a steep bank on this <br/>
line of sight about 30 yards away.  Make your way to this tree and <br/>
look on the southern side of its base for our Lucky Talisman hiding <br/>
under 3 rocks.  This is a busy park so take care when retrieving and <br/>
replacing the box not to be observed too closely.  Email us when you <br/>
find it and let us know how it's doing at: bigguy9210@yahoo.com<br/>
