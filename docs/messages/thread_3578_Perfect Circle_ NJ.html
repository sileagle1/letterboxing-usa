                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the update on "Toe Path"; I'm glad to hear it's still in decent shape <br/>
(there was some trouble with that one a few months ago, with the box getting <br/>
flooded and the pages soaked with rainwater, until we went back and repaired <br/>
it).<br/>
<br/>
We do have plans to plant more boxes in the area (in fact, we're going out <br/>
exploring this afternoon to look for fun locations). Perhaps we'll get a few <br/>
more boxes out there before the winter hits. You can always check our website <br/>
at http://www.pcdx.com/pclg/ from time to time to see if anything new has <br/>
arrived.<br/>
<br/>
And, I know what you're saying about O'Connors; after that giant salad bar, a <br/>
steak, and the sundaes, I usually want to crawl up in a corner with a blanket <br/>
and go to sleep, I'm so full....<br/>
