Well,<br/>
I can't begin to tell you how impressed I am with the<br/>
response to the PFX:500 club.  What I am amazed with<br/>
is that people still look at this whole thing as a<br/>
contest.    I guess the phrase "So what do I win?"<br/>
when explaining this hobby to possible newbies will<br/>
always rear it's ugly  head.  With numbers like 3000<br/>
in Connecticut alone, 7000 finds, 100 finds in every<br/>
state it's hard for a new person to "get" the whole<br/>
concept of letterboxing.  Especially when the<br/>
"quintessential" letterboxers start competitions.  Is<br/>
it really still all about the hike or has it become<br/>
something different?  If that is the reality, then who<br/>
are we to blame for this beautiful hobby becoming a<br/>
stamp hoarding contest?  Did the "founding fathers"<br/>
mean for it to turn out this way?  I think not.  When<br/>
did it start becoming all about the numbers?  Remember<br/>
when the person who had 13 boxes had the most in the<br/>
U.S.?  Has anyone ever READ the archives.  Not looked<br/>
at.....I mean READ.  If this is the path that<br/>
letterboxing is taking then maybe someone should "take<br/>
the helm" so to speak, and bring back the old school<br/>
methods.   DRIVE BYES STINK.  In case anyone beside me<br/>
was wondering what the point of those are.  Oh that's<br/>
right....It's all about the numbers!!!! <br/>
<br/>
 To the "higher ups": Stop scaring people away with<br/>
dictating what the standards are.  The are no<br/>
"distinctions."  We're all a bunch of wackos walking<br/>
through the woods looking like we're lost.   With 7000<br/>
finds are you not one of the wackos anymore?   If not,<br/>
then what has it become for you?   Playing a game<br/>
shouldn't be like the rat race, should it?<br/>

Wow! Very well written! I tend to see both sides of the fence so to <br/>
speak, and as someone in the less than 100 finds/plants group, I <br/>
would either need a ton of money for traveling or the ability to <br/>
move out to a state/area with more than a few randomly spread out <br/>
boxes to even come close to some of the outragous numbers I have <br/>
seen posted. So for me, it looks like I will always be bringing up <br/>
the rear... I am happy for all these people who have found/planted <br/>
so many boxes and they do have a right to brag about their numbers, <br/>
but with numbers like those, I often feel very inadaquate in the <br/>
letterboxing community "rat race". As for the drive-bys, I tend to <br/>
like having them, as long as it isn't every box out there. These <br/>
boxes are good for kids to learn the hobby and not be tired halfway <br/>
up the mountain, but I do wish there were more boxes with longer and <br/>
more involved trails. Letterboxing is what you make of it and there <br/>
should be no standards, other than respecting the nature around you <br/>
while you are on your boxing journey. Not only do letterboxES come <br/>
in all shapes ad sizes, letterboxERS do to. If drive-bys don't <br/>
appeal to you, just skip them. Ten mile hikes don't appeal to me <br/>
because I always have kids with me, so I just skip those altogether. <br/>
But hey, that's just my two cents.<br/>

I'm sure everyone will agree that the hobby of letterboxing attracts people<br/>
to it for different reasons. Some people religiously count their boxes,<br/>
others religiously don't. Some are in it for the hike, others for the art,<br/>
others for the hunt, others for the camaraderie. I know 'boxers who don't<br/>
plant or find, they just carve stamps and give their stamps to others to<br/>
plant. For some 'boxers I know it IS about the numbers and who gets there<br/>
first and they take pleasure in sharing their accomplishments. I must say,<br/>
however, that I have not met one person for whom this hobby is a contest or<br/>
a competition with other 'boxers. I think perhaps that folks who feel<br/>
pressure may be inferring something that it not being implied.<br/>
<br/>
I say this particularly because the post that I am assuming All About the<br/>
Hike is referring to was penned by a person who is the most prolific of<br/>
boxers, yes, but is also someone who joyously cheers on EVERYONE regardless<br/>
of whether they have 1 find or 1000, whether they as passionate about hiking<br/>
as she is or whether they crave the next drive-by.  I know the post came<br/>
from a joy of relating the story (and the encouragement some of us have<br/>
given her to share her stories) and not the desire to boast about numbers.<br/>
<br/>
I am terribly frustrated by the response to her post, because it seems that<br/>
every time she posts about her forays, she gets flack because of the number<br/>
of boxes found or the extent of her travels. You talk about "the higher ups"<br/>
or "old timers" scaring people away from the list or the hobby, but it is<br/>
exactly this type of reaction that has made this person repeatedly feel like<br/>
somewhat of a pariah in a hobby she adores.<br/>
<br/>
I would encourage people who don't want it to "be about the numbers" to not<br/>
MAKE it about the numbers. That is, don't let the numbers of others get to<br/>
you. I just remember what my mother taught me as a child...to be proud of<br/>
myself and not to seek my worth or happiness in others but within myself.<br/>
The people who have found the high numbers are not the ones who are making<br/>
it a contest. It is the people, who, for some reason feel the need to keep<br/>
up rather than realizing that it's "all good". It really IS all good.<br/>
<br/>
To quote "the Daddy", "Just get out there and 'box".<br/>

Well I have just found my very first box and I am in a competition with<br/>
my close friend (who I might add is outwitting me:) and we are rather<br/>
enjoying the fun we are making of it.  I for one am into it being<br/>
somewhat of a game.  That's my personal interest in it.  I already LOVE<br/>
hiking and this just adds this fantastic dimension to it.  not to<br/>
mention traveling - I cant wait to travel now!!!!!!!   I applaud those<br/>
that have succeeded in finding any number of boxes.  this is just about<br/>
the coolest thing I have ever seen - a real life adventure.  I will<br/>
count every single one I find and brag about it!  I think this rocks.<br/>

<br/>
I don't know--I haven't seen anyone make a post that suggested it was<br/>
"a contest".  Some people are statistics people.  They like to count<br/>
an analyze and there's nothing wrong with that, but they seem to do it<br/>
to challenge themselves, not as a competition against others.<br/>
<br/>
How often do we see posts from people who write, "I found my first box<br/>
today and it was so much fun!!!"?  We don't harp on them for counting<br/>
their finds, do we?  They aren't bragging about their counts--they're<br/>
just happy about having something TO count.<br/>
<br/>
Almost everybody can tell you what box was their 100th find because<br/>
it's like an anniversary of sorts.  Kind of like telling something<br/>
you've been married for 50 years.  It's an accomplishment and<br/>
something to be proud of, but that doesn't imply they're rubbing it in<br/>
because you've been divorced twice and have been on your third<br/>
marriage for a measily nine years.  Come year number ten, they'll<br/>
probably congratulate you and say, "Good job!  Ten years is a great<br/>
accomplishment!"<br/>
<br/>
Wanda loves letterboxing and is probably more obsessive about it than<br/>
most of us (certainly myself!), but she's so supportive of other<br/>
letterboxers as well.  Her PFX500 list is a nod of congratulations to<br/>
everyone that makes it on the list.<br/>
<br/>
None of the posts I've seen have suggested that PFX counts are a<br/>
contest--until this one.<br/>
<br/>
-- Ryan, who's also not a big fan of drive-by boxes, but different<br/>
strokes for different folks--I'm not complaining!<br/>

We could not agree more with Ryan.  <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing IS about the hike. Its also about the challenges -- like <br/>
figuring out Ray's Dilemma, like getting a special clue in the mail <br/>
from Drew Clan, and like the elation after finally finishing the 10 <br/>
mile hike of "Quiet Corner".  <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is also about the numbers **to a certain extent**. When <br/>
you look at your PFX number, break it apart. We've met and exchanged <br/>
with over 100 fellow letterboxers -- each exchange has its own little <br/>
story -- and that is very near and dear to us.  The F shows the <br/>
number of finds -- each indicative of a challenge we met (be it <br/>
terrain, clues, compass directions, etc.). <br/>
<br/>
Every letterbox placed signifies a time commitment. Time taken to <br/>
carve the stamp, make the log, research the trail, place the box, <br/>
beta test the clues, put the clues on the web site. <br/>
<br/>
People need to remember that this is NOT a contest and don't read <br/>
into someone including a PFX number somewhere as show-boating. Take <br/>
on the view point that the PFX number represents time, commitment, <br/>
dedication and passion for the support. <br/>

&gt; Well,<br/>
&gt; I can't begin to tell you how impressed I am with the<br/>
&gt; response to the PFX:500 club.  What I am amazed with<br/>
&gt; is that people still look at this whole thing as a<br/>
&gt; contest. <br/>
<br/>
Okay what "Rules" do you want to make? <br/>
<br/>
There is plenty of room for PFX counts,Mystery boxes, Drivebys,hard <br/>
clues, easy clues, Spamps,an other assorted nuances of letterboxing. <br/>
Play the game the way you like, but let others play the way they <br/>
want.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Did the "founding fathers"<br/>
&gt; mean for it to turn out this way?  I think not.  When<br/>
&gt; did it start becoming all about the numbers? <br/>

Well, I AM impressed.  What other people's high numbers signify to me <br/>
is a passion &amp; commitment to something they love to do.  As a new <br/>
letterboxer, I absolutely love this hobby &amp; hope to continue to have <br/>
the same enthusiasm for years to come.  I may never reach these high <br/>
counts, but I don't care &amp; that's just me. <br/>
