&gt; &gt; Yes, but it is frustrating how often I go to check on a box that I <br/>
&gt; did not have inside an outer bag and somebody has *kindly* placed it <br/>
&gt; in an outer bag for me.  This past weekend we checked in on about 8 <br/>
&gt; letterboxes and 2 were found inside bags that should not have been.  <br/>
&gt; Several others were missing inside bags and/or had either the stamp <br/>
&gt; or the logbook exposed and not in a baggie.  One had no baggies in it<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; at all.  So where do these baggies go?   I doubt that a critter came <br/>
&gt; along looking for a spare baggie to bag his leftover lunch and nicely<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; placed everything back inside my rubbermaid container after swiping <br/>
&gt; the bag.  No, more likely a *person* put it back like that...  how <br/>
&gt; can you put everything back into the container and not notice that <br/>
&gt; you forgot the baggies?<br/>

&gt; &gt;   &gt; This is known as the Letterbox Moisture Retention System <br/>
&gt; (LeMoRS). <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; Since the outer baggies are guaranteed to tear, puncture or <br/>
&gt; unseal <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; within days of planting, all the system does is ensure that any<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; fluid <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; that reaches inside the baggie will remain in contact with the <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; letterbox into perpetuity, which is does with a near 100% <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; performance <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; record....<br/>

&gt; &gt;   Too funny!! I initially made the mistake of placing the first few<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   boxes I planted INSIDE a large bag, thinking it would protect <br/>
&gt; them <br/>
&gt; &gt;   better. WRONG!! Moisture retention is exactly what it does. In <br/>
&gt; &gt;   addition, it makes it much easier for an animal to drag off and <br/>
&gt; also <br/>
&gt; &gt;   much more "visible" to a passing muggle. Once I realized this, I <br/>
&gt; went <br/>
&gt; &gt;   back and removed the outer "box bags" (and of course they were <br/>
&gt; &gt;   punctured and retaining moisture).<br/>
