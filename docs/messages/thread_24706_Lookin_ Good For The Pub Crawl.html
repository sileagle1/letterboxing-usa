weekend in New Hope, PA.  Hikers and Hounds, Miz Scarlet and I were out <br/>

<br/>
The crawl will be very laid back, and you don't have to drink to join in <br/>
the fun.  Just one person per team has to order something from each of <br/>
the locations, and it does not have to be a drink.  So even if you don't <br/>
drink, consider coming on out and joining in the fun.<br/>
<br/>
You can sign up on AQ if you like, but you are not required.  Just meet <br/>
us at noon at Triumph Brewery, things should get fully underway by one.<br/>
