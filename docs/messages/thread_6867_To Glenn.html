Gee, thanks for your pathetic attempt at saying sorry.<br/>
<br/>
As I stated the other day, and I will state it again today.<br/>
<br/>
Glenn, go out and discover the magic of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Take a hike(and I don't mean that negative), listen to the birds, <br/>
look at the sky, watch a family having fun, and talk to people that <br/>
you meet on the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Life is too short to carry around this baggage of hate and meanness.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is fun! And there are a lot of interesting and fun <br/>
people in this special community.<br/>
