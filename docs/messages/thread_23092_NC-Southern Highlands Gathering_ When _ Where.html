<br/>
  There is no park permit fee, but they accept donations.  I believe there is a no-alcohol policy.  Facilities include a pool and skate park; I will find out policies on them.<br/>
<br/>
  DOGS:  I do know that dogs are not allowed in the park.  If dog-lovers (such as I am) would like to pitch in and hire a dogsitter, who can watch dogs in my fenced yard (nearby), I will accommodate friendly dogs who have their shots up to date; please bring their records, cuz I'm serious about protecting my own dogs, and cannot make this offer otherwise. If your dog does not get along with other dogs, there are several vets and boarding kennels you might consider.<br/>
<br/>
  I welcome volunteers for all aspects, since I'm a committee of one at this point.  For sure, you do not want me at the grill....<br/>
<br/>
  Pmail me to get onto the distribution list.  Details will follow as they develop!<br/>
