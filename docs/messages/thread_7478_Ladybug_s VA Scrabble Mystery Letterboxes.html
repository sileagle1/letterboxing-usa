<br/>
We found your Scrabble Mystery Boxes on Labor Day. The first box is <br/>
alive and kicking! The clues were very good and we did not have any <br/>
trouble locating the box. You might want to have the webmasters take <br/>
Jolly G-man's note about the box being missing off the website. <br/>
Almost all of the people that logged into the second box (there were <br/>
a dozen or more) did not log into the first. I think people are <br/>
skipping the first because of the note.<br/>
<br/>
We have a great day of hiking and appreciated the thoughtful mystery!<br/>
