&gt; "It's up to the hiker to determine their own hiking ability." I<br/>

<br/>
You've hit the nail on the head... Inherently, the problem with a 'rating'<br/>
system of any kind is that it can not cover all possibilities.  What one<br/>
considers to be an Average hike, another would consider an Extreme hike.  I<br/>
mean, a 5 mile hike in the meadow at Paradise Point on Mt. Rainer is not<br/>
something to be trifled with, by my standards, but I'm sure that to one such<br/>
as Master Carpenter, it's a piece of cake.<br/>
<br/>
First and foremost, no rating system can be fostered off on anyone at all.<br/>
No one can do that, and frankly, the fact that some seem to think that<br/>
others are trying to make anyone do anything they don't want to is almost<br/>
ludicrous.  The rating system I am using is a VOLUNTARY system. If you want<br/>
to use it, then rate your boxes with it, if you don't, then, please don't.<br/>
Simple as that. And, by not using it, you've made your choice about how<br/>
you're going to participate in this hobby, and that's just fine. I for one<br/>
am not going to not go after a box because it's not rated, nor because I<br/>
can't tell how difficult it may be to get to the vicinity of where it is<br/>
hidden.  I'm a responsible adult, I can tell when and if things are beyond<br/>
my capabilities and not attempt them.  I don't expect to be spoon fed, nor<br/>
do I expect that someone else, other than the placer, give me any special<br/>
help in locating where a particular box is located at.  I do appericate any<br/>
warnings that might be given my way, by anyone, along the lines of "Be<br/>
careful, the hike's not condusive to your children." or "The hike looks<br/>
tougher than it really is.", etc, etc, etc.  Nothing that, in my not so<br/>
humble opinion, ruins the placers intent of the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
But that's just me.... Seems to me that we have far to many that expect<br/>
otherwise and that, again, in my not so humble opinion, can ruin the intent<br/>
of the original placer.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Onward;<br/>
&gt; This may be opening a can of worms here.. and please don't hurt me,<br/>
&gt; but, has anyone ever considered creating a letterbox listing<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As far as this, that's kinda what we're trying to do over at my website.<br/>
But I'll never force anyone to do, or attempt to force anyone to do,<br/>
anything they don't want to.  But, hey..... That' just me. I'm not out to<br/>
take over the world. Far to much work is involved in doing that and then you<br/>
constantly have to look over your shoulder watching out for every two bit<br/>
hustler looking to make a name for themselves! (LOL!!!)<br/>

<br/>
I tend to think so.  Besides the obvious of looking up the trail <br/>
conditions on your own (Internet, trail guides, or even calling up <br/>
the rangers in charge of the trail in question for the most up-to-<br/>
date information possible), there's also the thought of knowing when <br/>
to cut your losses.  If you do decide to go for a letterbox and the <br/>
trail turns out to be longer or harder or whatever, you've got to <br/>
set a mindset and say, "Hey, the sun will set in one hour.  If I <br/>
don't find the letterbox in a half hour, I will turn back."  That <br/>
seems like a common sense kind of idea, but you'd be surprised at <br/>
how many letterboxers have gotten caught out in the dark because <br/>
they keep thinking, "Just a little bit farther...." and can't give <br/>
up--even when their safety depends on it.<br/>
<br/>
So, a clue with no terrain or difficulty information is okay.  <br/>
Everyone can look for it.  But as soon as one figures out that it's <br/>
a little out of their league, they should stop hunting down the <br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Notice I didn't say they should turn back.  The trail might be <br/>
beautiful and a great afternoon walk and can still be enjoyed.  But <br/>
if you only have time for a two-mile hike but the letterbox is five <br/>
miles away, enjoy the two-mile hike and forget the letterbox.  It'll <br/>
still be there if you want to try again later.  (Probably! *smile*)  <br/>
You can still have an enjoyable time, even without a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know, I'm too wordy.  It's my curse.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; has anyone ever considered creating a letterbox listing <br/>
&gt; specifically for target groups?<br/>
<br/>
Actually, there ARE listings specifically for target groups.  For <br/>
instance, Mischief has a page for all boxes in Washington.  The <br/>
target group, obviously, being anyone that letterboxes in <br/>
Washington.  I also have a lot of letterboxes listed on my website, <br/>
although the "target group" would be "people that want to find my <br/>
letterboxes".<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I admit, they aren't exciting examples, but they do exist!  <br/>
=)  But with so many thousands of letterboxes out there, one could <br/>
make a good case for created specialized lists to help narrow down <br/>
the choices.  A webpage with only "kid accessible" letterboxes.  Or <br/>
another webpage for "real hikers" where the minimum hiking distance <br/>
to get a letterbox should be at least five miles.  That sort of <br/>
stuff.  I don't know of anyone taking the time to create such lists, <br/>
but I could see their usefulness.<br/>
<br/>
If you can find someone to create and maintain such a list, I don't <br/>
see any problem with that.  =)<br/>
<br/>
In other news....  About Steve's difficulty rating: I'm not really <br/>
sure I understand what the fuss is about.  Especially since it's <br/>
completely voluntary.  If he wants to list such information on his <br/>
boxes, that's okay by me.  And as long as he doesn't force me to <br/>
follow that system, that's okay by me too.  =)<br/>

Thanks Ryan, I didn't mean to downplay a person's hiking ability. Ryan<br/>
hit the nail on this one, it's definitely up to the boxer to determine<br/>
how far to push it so to speak. <br/>
<br/>
I certainly don't claim any fantastic hiking ability and well, there<br/>
is a small river to cross for one of my bonus boxes, and I don't<br/>
outright state that. It could really deter people especially those<br/>
with kids, but again - I don't state that at all in my clue. <br/>
<br/>
It's up to someone to decide whether or not it's a good decision to<br/>
cross a raging river in springtime in maine or come back later in the<br/>
season when things have dried up a bit. It's worth it to come back and<br/>
just decide not to get that "last box" rather than ever risk putting<br/>
yourself in jeopardy.<br/>
