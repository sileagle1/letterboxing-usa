                    <div class="plaintext-content">After finding most of the letterboxes in the great state of Nebraska, and <br/>
without a single hitchhiker in any of them, I decided to create and launch <br/>
one myself. A trip to a grocery store provided the tools I needed -- an <br/>
eraser, a box cutter (the cheapest blade I could find, since I have to <br/>
throw it away before flying back east), ziploc bags, and a Mead notebook. I <br/>
then carved the Nebraska Hopper hitchhiker, commemorating the plague of <br/>
grasshoppers that are currently eating their way through the state.<br/>
<br/>
I encountered the little critters every time I walked through the prairie <br/>
grass -- hundreds and hundreds of them flying and hopping out of the way <br/>
just before I landed each step. I actually think I saw more grasshoppers <br/>
than people wearing red U of N Cornhusker shirts, hats and sweatshirts on <br/>
Saturday (game day) -- though it was a close count, for sure. Let me tell <br/>
you, those Nebraskans are football crazy!<br/>
<br/>
The stamp is a bit crude, I'll admit, but you have to give me credit for <br/>
working freehand with a box cutter! But now, somewhere in Nebraska, the <br/>
Nebraska Hopper Hitchhiker is itching to jump to a new location. Let me <br/>
know when you find him and I'll track his progress here:<br/>
