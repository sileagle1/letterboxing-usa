were very disturbed (and angry) to find the Nature of the Forest <br/>
Series in such poor condition.  Most all of the 6 boxes were left out <br/>
in the open and the Frog Letterbox was pretty much ruined.  The box <br/>
was so wet the log bookwas completely ruined.  We could not even <br/>
stamp in it was so wet.   We did our very best to repair the damage <br/>
caused by someone very careless.  PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL of those who <br/>
work so hard on making and placing these boxes. CARE FOR THEM BETTER <br/>
THAN YOU FOUND THEM.  Common courtesy and common sense make life a <br/>
bit easier for all.  Sorry the rant.<br/>

  I think most letterboxers are conscience of how to<br/>
care for others boxes. Maybe children or adults find<br/>
them and don't care and just toss them aside. Also<br/>
Weather conditions can have a lot to do with where our<br/>
boxes end up.<br/>
just my 2 cents<br/>
