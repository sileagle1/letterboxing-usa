Here's a series of six linked letterboxes on an easy, scenic five mile<br/>
hike, but with only the first clue published. The directions to the<br/>
later boxes will be found as you progress, which was fun for us and<br/>
hopefully will be enjoyable for you too. This linking could be a<br/>
problem if any boxes are vandalized, since the succeeding boxes will be<br/>
stranded...if you can't find a box, please email us (drewclan@aol.com)<br/>
and we'll go out right away and make sure it's not missing. We'll also<br/>
send you the next clue if you'd like.<br/>

#1: Bushy Point Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
At the far western end of Bushy Point, with Ledge Light in view on<br/>
bearing 248, look under the tall angle-iron signpost.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
