<p align="center"><strong>Treasures of the Forest</strong></p>
<p align="center">739 Main St, Hampden, MA</p>
<p align="center">(Southern, MA Just over the line from Stafford Springs, CT)</p>
<p align="center">Home of the late Thornton Burgess, author of many beloved 
children books.</p>
<p align="center">Hidden by IrishTinker and her little helpers Ladybug98, 
RosieBunny &amp; French Fox</p>
<p align="center">The italic quotes are from The Mother West Wind Collection of 
Tales</p>
<p align="center">You can get trail maps on the large brown sign in the parking 
lot. You can also get them in advance online at <a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Laughing_Brook/">http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Laughing_Brook/</a></p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">Starting Point: From the parking area walk back to Main Street 
and cross to the meadow on the opposite side. Walk down the mowed path to the 
Crooked Little Path. Turn Left entering the wooded Crooked Little Path. </p>
<p align="center">"<i>Peter Rabbit came hopping and skipping down the Crooked 
Little Path. Unc' Billy Possum always calls him Brer Rabbit, but everyone else 
calls him Peter. Peter was feeling very fine that morning, very fine indeed. 
Every few minutes he jumped up in the air, and kicked his heels together, just 
for fun."</i></p>
<p align="center">He skipped and jumped and giggled all the way down the twisting 
path until he came he came to the perfect quiet place to sit and relax. He 
decided to stop, hop up on the bench and catch his breath. From the far right 
corner of his eye he spotted something peeking out from between an old 
foundation and a tree. (Box 1) </p>
<p align="center">Peter just had to share the news of the treasure he found with 
all of his friends of the forest and meadow, so he quickly continued down the 
path which led back to the meadow &amp; hopped back across the road (Main 
Street). </p><i>
</i><p align="center">"When she reached the Green Meadows Old Mother West Wind opened 
her bag, turned it upside down and shook it. Out tumbled all the Merry Little 
Breezes and began to spin round and round for very joy" </p>
<p align="center">Upon entering the parking lot Peter noticed some of Mother 
West Winds children dancing in the tree tops. He hopped to the left of the brown 
Laughing Brook sign that stands on the left of the driveway and entered the 
Burgess Trail. Peter knew his friend must be near. He hopped to the right 
keeping the brook to his left. Pausing when he saw the large tree laying across 
the stream he saw Mother West Wind ahead on the path. Taking 38 large bounds 
(paces) he found her swirling by the dead tree. He told her of his treasure and 
she showed him that one of her little breezes got caught swirling inside the old 
tree and uncovered a treasure all her own under the leaves. (Box 2)</p>
<p align="center">Mother West Wind encourage Peter to blow along on his own and 
tell the other forest creatures, what they had found. She had to stay behind and 
keep an eye on her Merry Little Breezes. </p>
<p align="center">Peter Rabbit continued hopping down the path. At the 
intersection with the #3 post he hopped LEFT toward the Smiling Pool Path. Over 
the wooden path and passed his colorful shadows. At the next intersection he 
turned left over the bridge and to his favorite look out on the right. Still 
none of his friends to be found. He turned right and then left onto Jimmy Skunk 
Loop where he found Jimmy skunk searching for his breakfast of delectable 
beetles. </p><i>
</i><p align="center">"By and by he came to an old stump of a tree which was hollow 
and had the nicest little round hole in one side. Jimmy Skunk took hold of one 
edge with his two little black paws and pulled and pulled. All of a sudden the 
whole side of the old stump tore open and Jimmy Skunk fell flat on his back. 
When Jimmy Skunk had rolled over onto his feet again, there was </p>Striped Chipmunk hopping up and own right in the middle of the 
path, he was so angry." Good morning, Striped Chipmunk," said Jimmy Skunk. "Have 
you seen any beetles?" But Striped Chipmunk hopped faster than ever and he 
said:
<p align="center">"What do you mean, Jimmy Skunk, by pulling the side off my 
house?" </p>
<p align="center">"Is that the side of your house?" asked Jimmy Skunk politely. "I 
won't do it again."</p>
<p align="center">Jimmy Skunk stepped over the chattering chipmunk and continued 
flipping over rocks, rolling logs and scratching under leaves for his breakfast. 
</p>
<p align="center">Peter took 27 hops (steps) up the path to reach Jimmy. Peter 
waited patiently to tell Jimmy Skunk his tale. Jimmy wandered behind an oak tree 
with 2 trunks. About 10 feet behind that tree was a 2nd Oak with 2 trunks. Just 
in front of the 2nd oak tree and to the right was a large flat rock with a small 
log in front of it. Jimmy rolled the log and gasped. For there was a treasure 
waiting for him. (Box 3)</p>
<p align="center">The duo back tracked down the path and turned left away from the 
look-out. At the T they took the right over the bridge and took the first right 
after the bridge. </p><i>
</i><p align="center">"Joe Otter and Billy Mink were sitting on the Big Rock in the 
Smiling Pool. Because they had nothing else to do, they were planning mischief. 
Suddenly Billy Mink put a finger on his lips as a warning to Little Joe Otter to 
keep perfectly still. Billy's sharp eyes had seen something moving over in the 
bulrushes." </p>
<p align="center">Billy &amp; Joe climbed out of the pool and met Peter Rabbit and 
Jimmy Skunk at the op of the path. They quietly tip toed 10 paces down the path. 
There on the left behind a bush with many trunks is where the noise was coming 
from. Billy Mink scrambled behind and pulled out a box!! </p>
<p align="center">Bubbling with excitement the 4 buddies rushed back up the path 
turning left and running over the bridge. Veering to the right they entered the 
Green Forest Trail. They passed a blue dot. Running faster and faster they 
stayed to right which merged into LONE LITTLE PATH (there is a sign marking the 
Lone Little Path. Make sure you have gone far enough).</p><i>
</i><p align="center">" Mr. Sun was very, very bright and it was very, very warm, down 
on the Green Meadows Reddy Fox came hopping and skipping down the Lone Little 
Path that leads to the Laughing Brook. Hoppity, skip, skippity hop!" </p>
<p align="center">He was so happy with himself that he never saw his friends 
turning onto the path. Crash! All five crashed right into each other! Boom, they 
fell all about! Peter Rabbit rolled all the way to the beginning of the Lone 
Little Path, Joe Otter slid right off of the left of the path, Billy Mink fell 
to the right of the path, Jimmy Skunk being right in the middle of everyone fell 
right in the middle of the path with loud "PLUNK!" Poor Reddy Fox, being the 
only one coming from the opposite side of the path was hit the hardest and he 
bounced up the hill to the left of the path and landed right on a large rotten 
log laying at the trunk of fallen Hemlock tree. Standing up and brushing himself 
off he noticed a little box sticking out from the backside of the log. The 
friends all gathered around and opened the 5th treasure of the day. </p>
<p align="center">"We must tell Grandfather Frog of this forest mystery! He knows 
all the mysteries of the Green Forest." demanded Reddy Fox </p>
<p align="center">"We must get to the bottom of this mystery!" agreed Jimmy Skunk 
</p>
<p align="center"><i>"Grandfather Frog was old, very old, indeed, and very, very 
wise. He wore a green coat and his voice was very deep. When Grandfather Frog 
spoke everybody listened very respectfully. Even Billy Mink treated Grandfather 
Frog with respect, for Billy Mink's father and his father's father could not 
remember when Grandfather Frog had not sat on the lily pad watching for green 
flies."</i> </p>
<p align="center">They marched further down the Lone Little Path and merged to the 
right with the Green Forest Trail Loop heading towards Laughing Brook. Walking 
on, straight ahead Grandfather Frog was sitting in his favorite shady spot by 
the Laughing Brook. He sat perched in the crook of the large 3 trunk Oak Tree 
sitting directly on top of another box! (Box 6) </p>
<p align="center">When questioned he explained that it was there waiting for him 
when he arrived first thing in the morning. </p>
<p align="center">"What should we do?" inquired Peter Rabbit</p>
<p align="center">"The answer must be out in the forest. It is up to us to find 
it!" explained Grandfather Frog</p>
<p align="center">The 6 forest friends hurried back the way they came. Just before 
The Lone Path, at the #8 post they turned right onto the Green Forest Trail 
Loop. They passed a Hemlock in the middle of the path with a blue dot on it and 
passed 2 houses on the opposite side of the stream. They continued down the 
path. Meanwhile....</p><i>
</i><p align="center">"Paddy the Beaver heard Sammy Jay making a terrible fuss over in 
the aspen trees ... in the Green Forest." </p>
<p align="center">"What are you squawking about?" asked Paddy Beaver</p>
<p align="center">Sammy Jay explained that band of forest friends were coming the 
other way and that he better be prepared!!!!</p>
<p align="center">Paddy Beaver quickly brushed himself off, straightened his 
clothes and waited for his friends. He stood on a round rock in the middle of 
the path. There were other rocks in this area of the path but this one was round 
and in the middle with a small 2 trunked oak to its left. </p>
<p align="center">The band of friends arrived all chattering noisily. They each 
wanted to be the first to explain what was happening in the Green Forrest! Paddy 
Beaver and Sammy Jay began to laugh and laugh! </p>
<p align="center">"What's so funny?" inquired Reddy Fox.</p>
<p align="center">"You see, Sammy and I have been busy hiding boxes all over the 
Green Forrest and Meadow this morning to show all of you, our dearest friends, 
how much we enjoy you and appreciate you! I have hidden your 7th and final 
treasure down this path. </p>
<p align="center">Paddy explained "Go 50 paces down the path from this point. A 
tree is leaning over the path from left side of the path. The leaning tree has a 
bare spot on itâs left side from the base up to about 5 ft. To the left of the 
tree (about 10 feet off the path) there is a Large, Old, Dead, Hollowed Out 
Stump with fallen trees around it. Here you will find your 7th treasure! Enjoy! 
</p>
<p align="center">For the quickest exit to the parking lot go back down the Green 
Forest Path, and then to the Lone Little Path and follow straight back with no 
turns until you come to Smiling Pond. Go Left over the bridge, pass the pond 
observation deck and walk to the right of the gray building and thereâs your 
car! Or you can continue on the large loop for more of a hike. </p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">Please be respectful of these trails, be discrete when finding 
your box and replace them the way you found them covering them well so others 
may enjoy the hunt.</p></body></html>

<br/>I bet there's more of us around here than you think. :-) Â I know of or have met at least a dozen folks around western Mass....more than enough to have our own letterbox gathering just for us. &lt;g&gt;
