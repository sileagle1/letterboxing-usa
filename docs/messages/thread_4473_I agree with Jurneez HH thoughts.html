<div><span class="190512802-16022002">I have never planted 
a hitchhiker but have found and moved 2. I agree with Jurneez. I am very 
interested in where the boxes have been after I replanted them. I find it 
interesting to see where they end up and where they travel. I do not think that 
the location of where it is being placed should be announced just an 
announcement of where it was last found. In this way it can be tracked but 
nobody will know where it is going next. Chuck Straub and his dog Molly P15
