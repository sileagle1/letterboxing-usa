<div>For the event in Muskegon, I placed 9 new 
hitch hikers on 11-9-02 that were picked up &amp; will be traveling to a 
letterbox in the cities listed below:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"Mutt" Adopted by "Potak" &amp; heading for 
Kalamazoo, MI</div>
<div>"Greyhound" Caught by MommaDi &amp; staying in 
Grand Haven</div>
<div>"K-9 Pacifier" borrowed by "Dog is my co-pirate" 
&amp; soon to be buried in St Helen, MI</div>
<div>"Best Friend" is now with "Cocojul" &amp; headed 
for Gainsville, Fl</div>
<div>"Golden" is being polished by "Wet Dog Willie" 
&amp; this treasure will be hidden in St Helen or Tucson, AZ</div>
<div>"Rin Tin Tin" was rescued by "Jax n Ginge", but 
will be able to help rescue someone else in Archer. FL (Maybe 'mud mommy' needs 
to find this one LOL)</div>
<div>"Dog's Stash" was uncovered by "Dog is my 
co-pirate" and will be re-buried in St Helen, MI</div>
<div>"Hound Dog" was sniffed out by 'Janet' and will be

     I have a geocache travel bug, Eastward Ho, that has made it from <br/>
San Francisco to The Horrors of Spider Island. That is somewhere on  <br/>
Florida's east coast, now if it only could hook up with Rin Tin Tin <br/>
and head north. I wouldn't refuse any help! ugh oh!!! (a Ho and RTT) <br/>
never mind! <br/>
