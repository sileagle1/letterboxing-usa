Many thanks for both the clarification (because I'm dense) and for the wonderful service you and the other Webmasters have always provided to the letterboxing public.<br/>

&gt;There is a new FAQ on the new site (<br/>
&gt;http://letterboxing.wesgarrison.us/faq/newSite.html ), but I'm going to go ahead<br/>
&gt;and post what there is now. It will be expanding as questions are asked, but<br/>
&gt;here it pre-emptively.  If you have somethign that you figured out, but you<br/>
&gt;think should be added to this list, please email me off-list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also wanted to note that we're counting on the majority of users creating<br/>
&gt;their own accounts and inputting their own boxes, because I can only add so many<br/>
&gt;per day, and it'd take me a year to get caught up.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;My boxes are listed as being placed by "Webmaster" and I want them back.<br/>
&gt;First, you  <http: letterboxing.wesgarrison.us="" memberedit.asp=""> need an account.<br/>
&gt;After creating an account, just send an email to the webmasters, listing your<br/>
&gt;boxes and your account name. We'll switch your boxes over to you and let you<br/>
&gt;know when we're finished. Then you can edit them just like a box you'd entered<br/>
&gt;yourself. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How do I edit my box?<br/>
&gt;When you're logged in, you can use the "My Letterboxes" link in<br/>
&gt;<http: letterboxing.wesgarrison.us="" memberservices.asp=""> Member Services to view<br/>
&gt;your boxes. Each of your boxes will have a link to edit that box. These links<br/>
&gt;will also show up when you view the box from the state page, but you're the only<br/>
&gt;one that can see them. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had to remove my box. Can I delete my box?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a lot of boxes that I want to add. Is there some automated process so I<br/>
&gt;don't have to type in each one?<br/>
&gt;Sure! The easiest way is if they're in Excel format, with each row representing<br/>
&gt;a box. Make sure to include all of the information that's on the<br/>
&gt;<http: boxadd.asp="" letterboxing.wesgarrison.us=""> Add Box page. Once you've got<br/>
&gt;the info together, contact the webmasters (webmasters@letterboxing.org) and<br/>
&gt;they'll arrange a way to get your boxes put in all at once. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Do I need to create an account?<br/>
&gt;Not necessarily. You don't need an LbNA account to view boxes or get on the<br/>
&gt;<http: group="" groups.yahoo.com="" lbox-announce=""></http:> lbox-announce yahoo group. If<br/>
&gt;you're going to add boxes, then you need an account. <br/>

That's a good way to say it: Not duplicating, but making it appears in the new<br/>
world.<br/>
There just isn't an automatic way to put all the boxes in, unless you happen to<br/>
have yours typed up in Excel or in database format already, in which case I'll<br/>
enter them en masse.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there's an announce list where you get notifications of new boxes being<br/>
put in.<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lbox-announce/<br/>
Announcements from the database only, so no spam!<br/>
