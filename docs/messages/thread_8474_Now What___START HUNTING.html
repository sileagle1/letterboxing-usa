Remember, this is suppossed to be a fun and exciting hobby. No stress involved. That is unless you cannot find that large rock that is hiding the box that you are out looking for. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though! You should have fun with it all, don't get stressed or pressured in any way to do ANYTHING. You do whatever you are comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
If you do not want to, or cannot, carve your own stamp, than by all means use a store bought, or custom made stamp (let me know if you need help carving or designing one, would be more than happy to help out).<br/>
<br/>
As far as the *codename* goes, that is totally up to you as well. There is no definitive requirement to have one, however many people do to simple personalize the sport more.<br/>

I didn't catch your real name from your e-mail, but from your e-mail <br/>
(jkimball8@jglinc.com) I will assume (can be VERY dangerous to assume, but what the heck huh!)<br/>
that you name is....maybe.... J Kimball, or J Kim and you like 8 balls? Maybe...who knows but you right!<br/>

If you do chose to go with a codename (nickname, or whatever you want to call it) maybe youcan use something like:<br/>
<br/>
1. an 8 ball with your initials surrounding it.<br/>
2. J.K. (or J Kim, or Kim) from Kansas (or where ever you are from)<br/>
3. J.K. Boxing (spin on J.K. Rowling of Harry Potter fame...LOL)<br/>
<br/>
The possiblities are really endless. If you do w<br/>
