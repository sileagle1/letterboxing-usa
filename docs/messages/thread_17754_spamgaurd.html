and is required across all the yahoo platforms. I think the level of <br/>
bulk mail and sexy ads has almost been elimitated on this list, but <br/>
if you're getting stuff marked as spam from this group in your aol <br/>
account, you might try stopping the individual mail and using either <br/>
the daily digest or "read on the web only." Go to<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/join<br/>
<br/>
to change your yahoogroup options.<br/>
<br/>
I've noticed that aol itself has gone crazy with [spam] headings <br/>
since their own new upgrade. That's easy to fix if you're using v8 <br/>
or 9: use keyword spam to go to your "custom word list" and <br/>
enter "[spam]" as one of the headings you hate. Poof, you'll never <br/>
get another mail aol has tagged as spam.<br/>

&gt;Hi, Daniel! Unfortunately, SpamGuard is uneditable by the moderators<br/>

FYI, SpamGuard *is* editable -- the group admin can turn off or adjust the <br/>
SpamGuard settings in Management &gt; Messages. I suggest that it be turned <br/>
off for this group, since the spam problem hasn't been bad for this list.<br/>
