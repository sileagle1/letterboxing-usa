<br/>
I'm just getting started and hope to hide a letterbox in my area <br/>
soon.  I've read about how people write clues and I have one point of <br/>
contention.  I was trained as a forester and now work in survey.  We <br/>
were always taught that a pace was 2 steps or everytime one of your <br/>
feet touch the ground.  It's always seen that as a standard among <br/>
professionals who use pacing as a part of their job.  I've calibrated <br/>
mine and have used it sucessfully to cruise timber in remote areas <br/>
around the country.  To a professional a "step is just a step."  A <br/>
pace is two (2) steps.  I will be using my definition of a pace when <br/>
I set the box and I'll explain it in the clue document.<br/>
<br/>
I welcome your imput.<br/>

some people but I think that as long as we are all responsible enough to<br/>
define in our clues as to what we are referring to as a pace, that would be<br/>
fine. <br/>
