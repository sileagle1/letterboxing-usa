To all about the hike:<br/>
<br/>
If you don't enjoy the "game" aspect of boxing why must you attempt to ruin it for others that do?  There are many times in our lives when people do things that we wouldn't do ourselves.  Remember that statement "If you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything at all?"  Finding 5000 boxes is quite an accomplishment, I wish I had the time to dedicate to get that high.  But if it bothers you, then why not ignore it?  We just went through a nice thread in here about how nice and helpful and supportive everyone was.  This is an independent game/ hobby of sorts to be interpreted by each person as they choose.  The only rules are the rules you set for yourself.  I think CT is a great equal opportunity place for all types of boxers.  Some days I really have a craving to find a box.  Often that happens right before sunset or before a large snow storm.  Drive by boxes are great for just such occassions and also when you are toting a three year old as well.  I also never got<br/>
 mail other than bills before I found out about PLB's.  How great it is to get a random one especially! Oh the love... Anyway, I fully understand where you are coming from but allow others to have their fun too.  Complaining solves nothing.<br/>

Very well said, K.  While I am an avid hiker/backpacker, and I love<br/>
the letterboxes which require long hikes, it's not always all about<br/>
the hike for me.  The reason for that is that I just don't have the<br/>
time or the resources to travel to the great hikes often enough. <br/>
Letterboxing has shown me so many places in my area that I would have<br/>
never seen otherwise.  Some of those places have been nice long hikes<br/>
in the middle of nowhere.  But some have been virtual drive-by's, or<br/>
short hikes, or even borderline urban.  I enjoy them all and<br/>
appreciate the people who placed them showing me new and amazing<br/>
places.  It is not all about the numbers, it is about having a hobby<br/>
that relieves stress, that you truly enjoy.  If I decided to go<br/>
hardcore and rule out short walks, drive-by's and any other type of<br/>
letterbox such as PLB's, I would be severely limiting the frequency of<br/>
experiencing the joy of my hobby.  If some people can go do the hikes<br/>
I long for every week, then great, I am very happy for them and<br/>
jealous.  If they decide they will only search for letterboxes which<br/>
involve serious hiking, ok, cool, I'm glad they are enjoying the<br/>
hobby.  But, when I can take a detour on the way home from wherever I<br/>
happen to be working and hike a bit (or not) to find a box, I love it.<br/>
 Not as much as a great hike in the mountains, but I still love it.  A<br/>
great stamp and good clues- especially challenging clues- can make<br/>
even a physically easy to obtain letterbox very sophisticated in my<br/>
book.  Call me a city boy...  actually, no don't ever call me that!<br/>
