                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings fellow boxers, I am getting a lot of the same sort of questions regarding the LBMA T-shirts that I am selling so I figured I'd shoot a quick note to clear up any confusion. Images and prices are posted in the files sections of LBMA, LBNA and Newboxers. There is a folder called 2005 LBMA T-shirts. I do not need you to send any money right now, I just need your order by 10/31/05 via email so I know how many shirts to purchase and drop off at the screen printers. If at least 100 aren't ordered I will postpone this project until next year. I have got to sell 100 to bring them in at $10 each. So far I've got orders for about 30. Once 100 are sold, I will email everyone with my address and will need the money by Nov. 5th. This will give me time to buy the shirts and get them to the screenprinter. They will run the job a week or two after that. Those who wish to can pick them up and avoid shipping charges by attending the Tyler T-Shirt Gather at Tyler State Park, Newtown, PA the<br/>
 first Saturday in Dec. So I hope this clears up any confusion. Please email me OFFLIST with any other questions or with your orders. H&amp;H <br/>
