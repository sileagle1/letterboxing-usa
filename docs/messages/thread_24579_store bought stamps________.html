                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'll chime in; "icing on the cake" is very aptly put.  One reason I  <br/>
letterbox rather than geocache is that I am just in LOVE with  <br/>
people's creativity around this hobby.<br/>
If a box has a store bought stamp that I'm aware of, it falls to the  <br/>
bottom of the  list of boxes to pursue.  Also... if I know that a  <br/>
particular planter is fairly lackadaisical about updating<br/>
the status of their boxes, they tend to go to the bottom of the list  <br/>
as well.  Unfortunately my time to pursue boxes is very limited so I  <br/>
tend to seek out boxes I know there's a<br/>
higher probability of the box being there to find.   I'd rather spend  <br/>
3 hours seeking a craftily hidden box with a hand carve (no matter  <br/>
how crude) than spend 15 minutes<br/>
looking for a box that was obviously landscaped out of existence  <br/>
months ago that the planter never bothered to update.  But everyone  <br/>
has their own particular pet peeve.  :)<br/>

<br/>
that is how I feel too.... I really don't mind a store stamp to the extreme,<br/>
but when I open the box and it's a plain old store stamp my heart falls.<br/>
And especially after a difficult hunt, I like the enjoyment of a hand carved<br/>
stamp at the end of it.<br/>

<br/>
Not to mention a store stamp is easily replenishable.  You can't tell me you wouldn't be upset if your LB disappeared with a stamp you spent several hours carving.<br/>
<br/>
Finding a location and devising clues is a fair job in itself.  I, for one, have very little patience for stamp carving.  My stamp is very simplistic, and it took maybe less than two hours to carve, but that's good enough for me.  I'd go nuts if I tried doing something intricate.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds like there are pros and cons for both carved and store-bought <br/>
stamps.  I'm of ilk that even a crappily carved stamp is better than a <br/>
store-bought one.  It is only my opinion, though.  I always feel <br/>
disappointment in finding a store-bought stamp in a box.  I really <br/>
enjoy people's artistic efforts and creativity.  <br/>
<br/>
I think East Coasters and those in Dartmoor may feel differently (some <br/>
folks have stamps custom-made), maybe even some West Coasters feel that <br/>
way, too.  And not everyone is artistic and just because they aren't or <br/>
are not into carving they shouldn't feel that they can't place a store-<br/>
bought stamp and get involved.  This sport means different things to <br/>
different people.  <br/>
<br/>
I just had to give my two cents worth because I really, really love <br/>
finding hand-carved stamps.<br/>

<br/>
Well, I tend to seek out boxes marked as hand-carved, so I would be quite distressed to find a store-bought stamp in a box that claimed to be otherwise! :) :)  But, my experience to date ... a couple times the box wasn't marked one way or the other ...  finding a store-bought stamp makes me feel "what was the point, anyway?"  Not finding a box makes me feel frustrated or sad (depending on if I think it's my failure to find, or a box gone missing).  <br/>
<br/>
Here's the difference though.  If I'm disappointed because I couldn't find a box, I can contact previous finders and the planter, and beg for a clue or ask for clarification.  If I'm disappointed because it looks like a box has gone missing, I can let the planter know and hope that they will one day replace it.  Either way, I can imagine a future in which I do find the box!<br/>
<br/>
But, if I'm disappointed because a stamp was store-bought .... there's really no recourse.  It would be rude to write the planter and say, "Oh, poor me. Let me know if you carve a stamp someday."  So, I feel much more permanently disappointed by store-bought stamps. Especially unadvertised ones.<br/>

<br/>
Are people more disappointed to find no stamp (e.g., because it<br/>
was stolen), or a store bought one?<br/>
<br/>
====================================<br/>
<br/>
 Personally, I'm more disappointed to find a store-bought stamp.  If I know<br/>
a box has a store-bought stamp, it drops to the bottom of my to-find list<br/>
and, realistically, there's only a million to one chance that I'll bother to<br/>
have the time to go looking for it.  I have other interests.  Letterboxing<br/>
is near the top of my list of interests IF it means looking for a unique<br/>
stamp.  If it's a store-bought stamp, I have other things I'd rather do than<br/>
letterbox.  If there were only store-bought stamps, I wouldn't be a<br/>
letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
However........<br/>
<br/>
If a stamp turns up missing, there's always the chance the stamp will be<br/>
replaced and I can go looking for it again later.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, both ways I consider that I've come up a loser, but with the<br/>
missing stamp, there's still a chance.<br/>
<br/>
Now the worst of both worlds would be if I went looking for the stamp and it<br/>
was missing and then replaced, so I go looking for it all over again<br/>
and..........it's a store-bought stamp!  :-)  Then I would hope that someone<br/>
would wake me up from the baaaad dream.  That would almost be worse than the<br/>
Grinch stealing Christmas.<br/>

Not that store-bought stamps are going to keep me from boxing.... :-D<br/>

<br/>
Please keep in mind not everyone has the time, patience, or minimum amount<br/>
of skill to hand carve a stamp.  Besides, if you never ever found a similar<br/>
stamp for your logbook, wouldn't it be just as original?<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention a store stamp is easily replenishable.  You can't tell me you<br/>
wouldn't be upset if your LB disappeared with a stamp you spent several<br/>
hours carving.<br/>
<br/>
Finding a location and devising clues is a fair job in itself.  I, for one,<br/>
have very little patience for stamp carving.  My stamp is very simplistic,<br/>
and it took maybe less than two hours to carve, but that's good enough for<br/>
me.  I'd go nuts if I tried doing something intricate.<br/>
<br/>
Tony<br/>
<br/>
==========================<br/>
<br/>
If people have the time to go out letterboxing, then they have "the time,<br/>
patience, or minimum amount of skill" to either hand-carve a unique stamp or<br/>
do a unique drawing and send it off to a stamp company to have them make a<br/>
stamp.  That's letterboxing -- in my never humble opinion.  It's a matter of<br/>
priorities.  Make fewer boxes then and take some of the extra time you then<br/>
have to do some artwork on your stamps.  (Or even colaborate with someone<br/>
who likes to carve but hates to find hiding spots and devise clues and make<br/>
it a team effort.)<br/>
<br/>
The game/sport/pasttime/hobby, to me, is the *total* idea.  Your idea is<br/>
sort of like going out to play baseball but someone stole ball.  Sure, you<br/>
could go out there to the pitcher's mound and pretend to throw a curve ball<br/>
and someone could stand at the plate and pretend to hit that curve ball and<br/>
then someone could stand out in the outfield and pretend to catch that<br/>
ball.........but it's not a very thrilling idea.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, I get terribly upset when one of my letterboxes disappears.  There's a<br/>
good chance one just recently disappeared.........and it won't be my first<br/>
and it won't be my last.  Far from it.  I stomp my feet and throw myself on<br/>
the floor and flail my arms &amp; kick my legs, while my dogs give me the<br/>
strangest of looks...........ooooooh lookee there, lookee lookee, mum's gone<br/>
off the deep end again........and then I get over it.  So what?  Would<br/>
Michelangelo have been terribly angry to have found one of his masterpieces<br/>
destroyed?  Meaning at the hand of someone other than himself?  I would<br/>
think so.  Would it stop him from still doing his best the next time around.<br/>
Would it stop him from creating?  I don't think so.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, finding a location and devising clues is a fair job in itself.  Done<br/>
right, it should be.  But it's only *part* of the "job", so you get no Wilke<br/>
button (I'm probably seriously dating myself here) from me for a job *half*<br/>
well-done.  Letterboxing, in my never humble opinion, is art.  Anything less<br/>
should be sittin' in a garage sale someplace where they sell those cheap<br/>
prints of cigar-smokin' dogs playin' poker that I refuse to allow in the<br/>
house.<br/>

I, myself, don't like "park and stamps".  I prefer to have a little <br/>

<br/>
So clues that say "Get out of your car and behind the entrace sign is <br/>

to choose where to allot their mental energy I'd rather the planter <br/>
put it in the clues as opposed to carving the stamp.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The reason that I care about a unique stamp is because that's why I<br/>
letterbox.  99.9% of the boxes in this area are either in locations that<br/>
aren't mind-blowing whatso*ever* or, if they're in a great location, it's a<br/>
place I've probably been to anyway and will be to again, it's not the<br/>
letterbox that draws me.  There are only a couple of boxes I've ever found<br/>
in my own area that I could honestly say that "it's the hike that counts."<br/>
I work outdoors all day plus we go hiking/camping/rock climbing all the<br/>
time.  And I ain't no spring chicken.  So I've been all over pretty much all<br/>
of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana.  I can rarely afford to take any<br/>
"really spectacular" vacations.  There's only one spectacular location in<br/>
northeastern IL that I'd like to plant a box at but the authorities-that-be<br/>
won't give folks the location.  It's a 60 foot natural waterfall that's<br/>
supposed to be pretty cool.  But I'll find it.  I'm lookin' for it.  And<br/>
when I find it, there will be a box planted there............with a unique<br/>
stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Now if there are boxes in beautiful mountains someplace (like Michel<br/>
LaBranch's boxes in eastern Tennessee) THEN it could be all about the hike<br/>
to me.  Maybe.  Sorta.  :-)  I'd still want unique stamps but I'd be less<br/>
disappointed because the hike in some of those mountains would be terrific<br/>
and it's not like I can afford the gas to go down there very often.  Nah, I<br/>
take that back.  I still want unique stamps.  Anything less just gives me<br/>
the idea that we're dumbin' it down, as Ancient would say.  I'm just going<br/>
to hate to see the day when most of the boxes out there are a trek from one<br/>
Hobby Lobby to the next Hobby Lobby.  Why not just plant boxes right in the<br/>
Hobby Lobby stores and be done with it?  The clues could lead a person on a<br/>
walk around the store to end up at the stamp aisle, and then say "Pick a<br/>
stamp. Any stamp."  :-)<br/>
<br/>
About your question tho --<br/>
<br/>
I'm rarely going to know if the person did their best work possible or if<br/>
they intentionally made a crappy stamp.  This list was the first I had heard<br/>
of anyone intentionally not bothering to do their best because the stamp<br/>
might turn up missing and they'd be less disappointed if they'd<br/>
intentionally made a B stamp rather than an A stamp.  I've just always<br/>
assumed folks did their best and that some folks' best is better than other<br/>
folks' best.  I personally wouldn't dream of putting less effort into it<br/>
because it might end up lost or stolen.  I'd just make the clues harder the<br/>
next time around.  So yeah, color me naive on that subject -- I never<br/>
figured.  And I think I'd like to go on dreaming that, for the most part,<br/>
folks do their best.<br/>
<br/>
Now......if a carving says "I found really really really really impossible<br/>
box X", that would be the most perfectly awesome stamp in the world to me<br/>
because I'm absolutely awful awful awful awful at carving letters.  So<br/>
anyone that could carve that many letters into some PZKut or some<br/>
Mastercarve for a stamp -- I'd think that was certainly NO crappy stamp.<br/>
I'd think WOW, way to go!  Great stamp!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I totally understand your idea about stamps and mystery boxes.  A lot of my<br/>
stamps are related to the place but not in such a way as to make the place<br/>
identifiable.  I really would like to be able to carve the name of each<br/>
place as part of the stamp, even if my letters aren't the best, but yeah,<br/>
that could definitely give things away if people were looking at each<br/>
other's journals.<br/>

It seems then, that you could go looking for a box with a<br/>
store-bought stamp, and hope it comes up missing.  That would be<br/>
a net improvement :)<br/>
<br/>
I do find this topic fascinating, as I don't care even if the box<br/>
is there (and it baffles me that people whine about missing boxes,<br/>
store bought stamps, need assurances that the boxes are there, etc.).<br/>
To each their own, and likewise I imagine it baffles others when<br/>
I blow them off when they ask these things of me.<br/>
<br/>
But, I have another question.  It has been stated (and reiterated)<br/>
that people prefer crappy hand-carved stamps to store bought ones,<br/>
no matter how artistic the store bought one is.  To me, this isn't<br/>
logical, but grant that logic need not play any role in it.  (I<br/>
agree, BTW, I don't care for store bought stamps either).<br/>
<br/>
My question is: How do people feel about hand-carved stamps that<br/>
make no attempt to be artistic.  That is, just represent proof<br/>
that they found the box.  Like some carving that says: "I found<br/>
really really really really impossible box X"?<br/>
<br/>
I'll admit that my reluctance to carve a stamp relating to the<br/>
place stems from the fact that I prefer to create clues to mystery<br/>
boxes, and a stamp image that represents the place of a mystery<br/>
box is an information leak.<br/>

Heaven forbid the placer of a box has some disability that would keep them from carving a stamp and maybe they don't have your connection or money to have someone else or a company make their stamp for them. In my not so humble opinion that is a really high horsed position you have there. <br/>
<br/>
My first box was DARE I say a store bought stamp. It was store bought because *I* liked the stamp and felt it was appropriate for the location. DARE I say I helped my fiancee place her letterbox with a NO LONGER IN PRINT store bought stamp or that she uses another NO LONGER IN PRINT store bought stamp for her regular stamp. <br/>
<br/>
Heaven forbid someone uses a poochie stamp from the 80's to place in their box instead of a hand carved stamp. You know sometimes, just sometimes a store bought stamp can be just as good or better than a carved stamp because it still can be a rare find. <br/>
<br/>
Lucky there are thousands of DIFFERENT letterboxes to chose from and thankfully not all the placer go by "I'm better than you elitist rules".<br/>
<br/>
Barrudaki- Who's really getting tired of the elitist attitude some people display when it comes to a "Hobby" and who is happy there are an array of varying letterbox placers who can find creative ways to contribute that don't always rely on the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If people have the time to go out letterboxing, then they have "the time,<br/>
&gt; patience, or minimum amount of skill" to either hand-carve a unique stamp or<br/>
&gt; do a unique drawing and send it off to a stamp company to have them make a<br/>
&gt; stamp.  That's letterboxing -- in my never humble opinion.  It's a matter of<br/>
&gt; priorities.  Make fewer boxes then and take some of the extra time you then<br/>
&gt; have to do some artwork on your stamps.  (Or even colaborate with someone<br/>
&gt; who likes to carve but hates to find hiding spots and devise clues and make<br/>
&gt; it a team effort.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The game/sport/pasttime/hobby, to me, is the *total* idea.  Your idea is<br/>
&gt; sort of like going out to play baseball but someone stole ball.  Sure, you<br/>
&gt; could go out there to the pitcher's mound and pretend to throw a curve ball<br/>
&gt; and someone could stand at the plate and pretend to hit that curve ball and<br/>
&gt; then someone could stand out in the outfield and pretend to catch that<br/>
&gt; ball.........but it's not a very thrilling idea.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sure, I get terribly upset when one of my letterboxes disappears.  There's a<br/>
&gt; good chance one just recently disappeared.........and it won't be my first<br/>
&gt; and it won't be my last.  Far from it.  I stomp my feet and throw myself on<br/>
&gt; the floor and flail my arms &amp; kick my legs, while my dogs give me the<br/>
&gt; strangest of looks...........ooooooh lookee there, lookee lookee, mum's gone<br/>
&gt; off the deep end again........and then I get over it.  So what?  Would<br/>
&gt; Michelangelo have been terribly angry to have found one of his masterpieces<br/>
&gt; destroyed?  Meaning at the hand of someone other than himself?  I would<br/>
&gt; think so.  Would it stop him from still doing his best the next time around.<br/>
&gt; Would it stop him from creating?  I don't think so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, finding a location and devising clues is a fair job in itself.  Done<br/>
&gt; right, it should be.  But it's only *part* of the "job", so you get no Wilke<br/>
&gt; button (I'm probably seriously dating myself here) from me for a job *half*<br/>
&gt; well-done.  Letterboxing, in my never humble opinion, is art.  Anything less<br/>
&gt; should be sittin' in a garage sale someplace where they sell those cheap<br/>
&gt; prints of cigar-smokin' dogs playin' poker that I refuse to allow in the<br/>
&gt; house.<br/>

***************************<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of sending this conversation over the edge to a full-fledged<br/>
flame war, I would like to gently point out that pointing fingers and<br/>
calling people elitist is not a way to foster conversation.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to suggest looking at the discussion from a little different<br/>
angle - the folks who have been around awhile have learned the traditions<br/>
and "old ways" to play the game.  They often know the logic behind the "why<br/>
nots" from a personal point of view.  New folks come in and have a great<br/>
deal of enthusiasm and literally ooze with new ideas.  I think both groups<br/>
of people are great!<br/>
<br/>
However, those who haven't been around forever and a day may need to realize<br/>
that the old-timers - Silverbacks - have seen quite a few rounds of new<br/>
folks who have come in with grand ideas and some of those ideas have<br/>
degraded the hobby.  So if they just sit back and let the new folks run all<br/>
over and do whatever they want to do without speaking up, the risk is that<br/>
the hobby becomes little more than collecting belly button lint.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps what you see as elitism is actually an effort to keep the standards<br/>
high.  I think precious few folks on here would say that store-boughts are<br/>
NEVER okay or drive-by boxes are ALWAYS bad boxes, but by speaking out about<br/>
why they don't like those, Silverbacks are trying to prevent the standards<br/>
from being lowered across the board.<br/>
<br/>
A little tolerance all the way around would go a long way, but new folks -<br/>
respect those who have been at it for several years.  Silverbacks - remember<br/>
you were new once too and didn't want to be discouraged on every turn!<br/>

someone else's opinion, is the first person's opinion suddenly elitist?<br/>
It's my opinion, based on what I like about letterboxing.  And for what it's<br/>
worth, stamps can be very cheap to have a company make.  nwstamps.com can<br/>
often make them up for less than they can be bought at Hobby Lobby if a<br/>
person emails them their drawing.<br/>
<br/>
Just because a stamp is "no longer in print" (I'm not sure how a stamp can<br/>
be "in print" anyway but I'll use that phrase since you did), doesn't mean<br/>
there aren't an awfully lot of 'em out there.  But that doesn't matter.  It<br/>
might be no longer "in print" but I probably have one of 'em. It's still not<br/>
a unique stamp.  It was mass produced at some point by someone who had<br/>
nothing to do with letterboxing.  I don't care to find those kinds of<br/>
stamps.  That's my opinion.   Your mileage may certainly vary.  Heck, if<br/>
it's "a poochie stamp from the 80s", I probably have it already.<br/>
<br/>
If I had a disability that kept me from carving a stamp by myself, I would,<br/>
as I suggested in my post, find someone interested in collaborating with me<br/>
in making boxes.  That's assuming that my disability allowed me to plant<br/>
letterboxes at all.  There do happen to be folks around that like the<br/>
carving aspect but don't like the planting part of it.   But I also don't<br/>
really think I'd mind cuttin' a person like that some slack.  Unfortunately,<br/>
those don't exactly seem to be the folks placing the store-bought stamps for<br/>
the most part.<br/>
<br/>
Right now there are plenty of different styles of boxing around that folks<br/>
can pick and choose what they like.  But the way it's been headed, I'm not<br/>
all that sure that's going to last.  We don't have "thousands" of boxes in<br/>
this neck of the woods, and many many more new folks are going the<br/>
store-bought route 'round here.  I can foresee that ending up being<br/>
considered the "norm".  And that's OK -- I just won't be boxing anymore<br/>
then.  I neither live to box nor box to live.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you notice, on this list, I rarely give an opinion unless an opinion is<br/>
requested in a post.  But if someone is going to ask a question and wants<br/>
opinions, then sorry, yes, I feel I have a right to give my opinion.  I<br/>
guess you'd just rather hear the opinions from the folks who love<br/>
store-bought stamps.  Oh well.  If you don't like it, hit that good ol'<br/>
delete button when you see my email addy pop up.  Unless ya do that, you'll<br/>
be listening to my opinion when a request for opinions pops up.  Sorry 'bout<br/>
that.  Nah.........really I'm not.<br/>

store bought stamp can be just as good or better than a carved stamp because<br/>
it still can be a rare find.<br/>
<br/>
Lucky there are thousands of DIFFERENT letterboxes to chose from and<br/>
thankfully not all the placer go by "I'm better than you elitist rules".<br/>
<br/>
Barrudaki- Who's really getting tired of the elitist attitude some people<br/>
display when it comes to a "Hobby" and who is happy there are an array of<br/>
varying letterbox placers who can find creative ways to contribute that<br/>
don't always rely on the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If people have the time to go out letterboxing, then they have "the time,<br/>
&gt; patience, or minimum amount of skill" to either hand-carve a unique stamp<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; do a unique drawing and send it off to a stamp company to have them make a<br/>
&gt; stamp.  That's letterboxing -- in my never humble opinion.  It's a matter<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; priorities.  Make fewer boxes then and take some of the extra time you<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; have to do some artwork on your stamps.  (Or even colaborate with someone<br/>
&gt; who likes to carve but hates to find hiding spots and devise clues and<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; it a team effort.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The game/sport/pasttime/hobby, to me, is the *total* idea.  Your idea is<br/>
&gt; sort of like going out to play baseball but someone stole ball.  Sure, you<br/>
&gt; could go out there to the pitcher's mound and pretend to throw a curve<br/>
ball<br/>
&gt; and someone could stand at the plate and pretend to hit that curve ball<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; then someone could stand out in the outfield and pretend to catch that<br/>
&gt; ball.........but it's not a very thrilling idea.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sure, I get terribly upset when one of my letterboxes disappears.  There's<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; good chance one just recently disappeared.........and it won't be my first<br/>
&gt; and it won't be my last.  Far from it.  I stomp my feet and throw myself<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; the floor and flail my arms &amp; kick my legs, while my dogs give me the<br/>
&gt; strangest of looks...........ooooooh lookee there, lookee lookee, mum's<br/>
gone<br/>
&gt; off the deep end again........and then I get over it.  So what?  Would<br/>
&gt; Michelangelo have been terribly angry to have found one of his<br/>
masterpieces<br/>
&gt; destroyed?  Meaning at the hand of someone other than himself?  I would<br/>
&gt; think so.  Would it stop him from still doing his best the next time<br/>
around.<br/>
&gt; Would it stop him from creating?  I don't think so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, finding a location and devising clues is a fair job in itself.  Done<br/>
&gt; right, it should be.  But it's only *part* of the "job", so you get no<br/>
Wilke<br/>
&gt; button (I'm probably seriously dating myself here) from me for a job<br/>
*half*<br/>
&gt; well-done.  Letterboxing, in my never humble opinion, is art.  Anything<br/>
less<br/>
&gt; should be sittin' in a garage sale someplace where they sell those cheap<br/>
&gt; prints of cigar-smokin' dogs playin' poker that I refuse to allow in the<br/>
&gt; house.<br/>

&gt; I don't have a problem with store bought stamps if they match the <br/>
&gt; theme or location of the box.  If its hidden at a lighthouse and its a <br/>
&gt; store bought stamp of a lighthouse, I'm totally fine with it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I, myself, don't like "park and stamps".  I prefer to have a little <br/>
&gt; adventure of sorts or a challenging set of clues.  (note that's not <br/>
&gt; the same thing as bad clues).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So clues that say "Get out of your car and behind the entrace sign is <br/>
&gt; the box" annoys me more than a store bought stamp.  If the planter has <br/>
&gt; to choose where to allot their mental energy I'd rather the planter <br/>
&gt; put it in the clues as opposed to carving the stamp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But of course I've never not done a "park and stamp"... I mean I want <br/>
&gt; to increase my find count don't I?<br/>

At the risk of sending this conversation over the edge to a full-fledged<br/>

<br/>
I would like to suggest looking at the discussion from a little different<br/>

and "old ways" to play the game. They often know the logic behind the "why<br/>
nots" from a personal point of view. New folks come in and have a great<br/>
deal of enthusiasm and literally ooze with new ideas. I think both groups<br/>
of people are great!<br/>
<br/>
However, those who haven't been around forever and a day may need to realize<br/>
that the old-timers - Silverbacks - have seen quite a few rounds of new<br/>
folks who have come in with grand ideas and some of those ideas have<br/>
degraded the hobby. So if they just sit back and let the new folks run all<br/>
over and do whatever they want to do without speaking up, the risk is that<br/>
the hobby becomes little more than collecting belly button lint.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps what you see as elitism is actually an effort to keep the standards<br/>
high. I think precious few folks on here would say that store-boughts are<br/>
NEVER okay or drive-by boxes are ALWAYS bad boxes, but by speaking out about<br/>
why they don't like those, Silverbacks are trying to prevent the standards<br/>
from being lowered across the board.<br/>
<br/>
A little tolerance all the way around would go a long way, but new folks -<br/>
respect those who have been at it for several years. Silverbacks - remember<br/>
you were new once too and didn't want to be discouraged on every turn!<br/>

When someone uses the phrase "In my never humble opinion" which Mosey used, it sounds elitist. Like their opinion is the "rule". Just because someone is considered a silverback or old-timer on the boards doesn't mean they can push the newbies around. Tony was voicing an opinion and Mosey came back with a flamed response about if someone has the time to go letterboxing then they have the time and resources to get a hold of a hand carved stamp. <br/>
<br/>
I apologize if my disagreeing came off as not so humble as Mosey's post, I really don't expect anyone to forgive me because well you know I'm a newbie and not a silverback who knows it all. <br/>
<br/>
Barrudaki- Who thinks just because someone has been around doesn't mean they have the right to boss people around.<br/>

<br/>
Your never so humble opinion from your original post didn't leave room for some with disability (funny how your response does now), nor does it leave room for someone who maybe doesn't have the money or passion to spend on a company to make their stamp. Your never so humble opinion also does not leave room for someone who is just starting out and may not have your connections to get someone to carve them a stamp. Your never so humble opinion has been noted and I responded in a not so humble way to it. If you don't like how I responded then maybe you should look closer at how you boast your never humble opinion.<br/>
<br/>
There are several reasons why someone may decide to use a store bought stamp despite your never so humble opinion. You obviously have your way about how things should be and others have their ways. I was and still am looking forward to other people's opinions about store bought stamps however, post like yours will not help to swade my opinion about certain types of stamps. Those type of elitist "never so humble" opinions post only tells me the person behind it is too bent on voicing "their way" and is too close minded to see how other ways may work.<br/>
<br/>
You can respond how you want I'll no longer be responding to this part of the thread. I've said my piece<br/>

&gt; There's nothing elitist about it.  Why, when someone's opinion doesn't match<br/>
&gt; someone else's opinion, is the first person's opinion suddenly elitist?<br/>
&gt; It's my opinion, based on what I like about letterboxing.  And for what it's<br/>
&gt; worth, stamps can be very cheap to have a company make.  nwstamps.com can<br/>
&gt; often make them up for less than they can be bought at Hobby Lobby if a<br/>
&gt; person emails them their drawing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just because a stamp is "no longer in print" (I'm not sure how a stamp can<br/>
&gt; be "in print" anyway but I'll use that phrase since you did), doesn't mean<br/>
&gt; there aren't an awfully lot of 'em out there.  But that doesn't matter.  It<br/>
&gt; might be no longer "in print" but I probably have one of 'em. It's still not<br/>
&gt; a unique stamp.  It was mass produced at some point by someone who had<br/>
&gt; nothing to do with letterboxing.  I don't care to find those kinds of<br/>
&gt; stamps.  That's my opinion.   Your mileage may certainly vary.  Heck, if<br/>
&gt; it's "a poochie stamp from the 80s", I probably have it already.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I had a disability that kept me from carving a stamp by myself, I would,<br/>
&gt; as I suggested in my post, find someone interested in collaborating with me<br/>
&gt; in making boxes.  That's assuming that my disability allowed me to plant<br/>
&gt; letterboxes at all.  There do happen to be folks around that like the<br/>
&gt; carving aspect but don't like the planting part of it.   But I also don't<br/>
&gt; really think I'd mind cuttin' a person like that some slack.  Unfortunately,<br/>
&gt; those don't exactly seem to be the folks placing the store-bought stamps for<br/>
&gt; the most part.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Right now there are plenty of different styles of boxing around that folks<br/>
&gt; can pick and choose what they like.  But the way it's been headed, I'm not<br/>
&gt; all that sure that's going to last.  We don't have "thousands" of boxes in<br/>
&gt; this neck of the woods, and many many more new folks are going the<br/>
&gt; store-bought route 'round here.  I can foresee that ending up being<br/>
&gt; considered the "norm".  And that's OK -- I just won't be boxing anymore<br/>
&gt; then.  I neither live to box nor box to live.  :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you notice, on this list, I rarely give an opinion unless an opinion is<br/>
&gt; requested in a post.  But if someone is going to ask a question and wants<br/>
&gt; opinions, then sorry, yes, I feel I have a right to give my opinion.  I<br/>
&gt; guess you'd just rather hear the opinions from the folks who love<br/>
&gt; store-bought stamps.  Oh well.  If you don't like it, hit that good ol'<br/>
&gt; delete button when you see my email addy pop up.  Unless ya do that, you'll<br/>
&gt; be listening to my opinion when a request for opinions pops up.  Sorry 'bout<br/>
&gt; that.  Nah.........really I'm not.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wow Mosey, I mean wow. Heaven forbid the placer of a box has some disability<br/>
&gt; that would keep them from carving a stamp and maybe they don't have your<br/>
&gt; connection or money to have someone else or a company make their stamp for<br/>
&gt; them. In my not so humble opinion that is a really high horsed position you<br/>
&gt; have there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My first box was DARE I say a store bought stamp. It was store bought<br/>
&gt; because *I* liked the stamp and felt it was appropriate for the location.<br/>
&gt; DARE I say I helped my fiancee place her letterbox with a NO LONGER IN PRINT<br/>
&gt; store bought stamp or that she uses another NO LONGER IN PRINT store bought<br/>
&gt; stamp for her regular stamp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Heaven forbid someone uses a poochie stamp from the 80's to place in their<br/>
&gt; box instead of a hand carved stamp. You know sometimes, just sometimes a<br/>
&gt; store bought stamp can be just as good or better than a carved stamp because<br/>
&gt; it still can be a rare find.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lucky there are thousands of DIFFERENT letterboxes to chose from and<br/>
&gt; thankfully not all the placer go by "I'm better than you elitist rules".<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Barrudaki- Who's really getting tired of the elitist attitude some people<br/>
&gt; display when it comes to a "Hobby" and who is happy there are an array of<br/>
&gt; varying letterbox placers who can find creative ways to contribute that<br/>
&gt; don't always rely on the stamp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If people have the time to go out letterboxing, then they have "the time,<br/>
&gt; &gt; patience, or minimum amount of skill" to either hand-carve a unique stamp<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; do a unique drawing and send it off to a stamp company to have them make a<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp.  That's letterboxing -- in my never humble opinion.  It's a matter<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; priorities.  Make fewer boxes then and take some of the extra time you<br/>
&gt; then<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to do some artwork on your stamps.  (Or even colaborate with someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; who likes to carve but hates to find hiding spots and devise clues and<br/>
&gt; make<br/>
&gt; &gt; it a team effort.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The game/sport/pasttime/hobby, to me, is the *total* idea.  Your idea is<br/>
&gt; &gt; sort of like going out to play baseball but someone stole ball.  Sure, you<br/>
&gt; &gt; could go out there to the pitcher's mound and pretend to throw a curve<br/>
&gt; ball<br/>
&gt; &gt; and someone could stand at the plate and pretend to hit that curve ball<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; then someone could stand out in the outfield and pretend to catch that<br/>
&gt; &gt; ball.........but it's not a very thrilling idea.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sure, I get terribly upset when one of my letterboxes disappears.  There's<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; good chance one just recently disappeared.........and it won't be my first<br/>
&gt; &gt; and it won't be my last.  Far from it.  I stomp my feet and throw myself<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the floor and flail my arms &amp; kick my legs, while my dogs give me the<br/>
&gt; &gt; strangest of looks...........ooooooh lookee there, lookee lookee, mum's<br/>
&gt; gone<br/>
&gt; &gt; off the deep end again........and then I get over it.  So what?  Would<br/>
&gt; &gt; Michelangelo have been terribly angry to have found one of his<br/>
&gt; masterpieces<br/>
&gt; &gt; destroyed?  Meaning at the hand of someone other than himself?  I would<br/>
&gt; &gt; think so.  Would it stop him from still doing his best the next time<br/>
&gt; around.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Would it stop him from creating?  I don't think so.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yes, finding a location and devising clues is a fair job in itself.  Done<br/>
&gt; &gt; right, it should be.  But it's only *part* of the "job", so you get no<br/>
&gt; Wilke<br/>
&gt; &gt; button (I'm probably seriously dating myself here) from me for a job<br/>
&gt; *half*<br/>
&gt; &gt; well-done.  Letterboxing, in my never humble opinion, is art.  Anything<br/>
&gt; less<br/>
&gt; &gt; should be sittin' in a garage sale someplace where they sell those cheap<br/>
&gt; &gt; prints of cigar-smokin' dogs playin' poker that I refuse to allow in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; house.<br/>

<br/>
I find that my tolerance for non-artistic hand carved stamps very <br/>
much related to the clues.  For instance, if I finally figure out <br/>
one of your mystery boxes or say a leger de maine box, and find the <br/>
actual box, I almost don't care what the stamp looks like--the <br/>
reward for me is the satisfaction of finding that box!  If the stamp <br/>
is good, woo hoo a bonus.  Either way, I'm just doing the Snoopy <br/>
dance.<br/>
<br/>
If, however, the clues are so darned simple to the point of driveby, <br/>
I expect at least an effort to carve a stamp or make a creative <br/>
logbook, or creative outside box. My expectations of the <br/>
craftsmanship aren't too high, however, because I myself am not a <br/>
gifted carver, but at least give it a college try.<br/>
<br/>
And then too, if the box is by a newbie, I appreciate anything I get <br/>
from that box, because I can empathize with how nerve wracking <br/>
putting your first boxes together can be.  <br/>
<br/>
The only real disappointment for me would be a box with easy clues, <br/>
a store bought stamp, a lined notebook placed by someone who's been <br/>
boxing for a while. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll admit that my reluctance to carve a stamp relating to the<br/>

artist, that bothers me.  And yeah, that's my opinion.  It's not elitist.<br/>
It's not humble.  It's just my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not bossing anyone around whatsoever.  If I was, there sure wouldn't be<br/>
the amount of store-bought stamps in boxes as there currently are in this<br/>
neck of the woods.  Even the two that the forest preserve rangers put out as<br/>
"educational boxes" both have Hobby Lobby stamps.  And I *do* mean Hobby<br/>
Lobby stamps.  The same stamps that are in two other boxes in this county<br/>
already and that I *know* are sitting over at Hobby Lobby right now.  I<br/>
haven't once told anybody that they *must* letterbox a certain way.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it.  If someone *does* have the time to go letterboxing, then<br/>
they *do* have the time to carve a stamp.  It's a question of priorities.<br/>
It takes me a looong time to carve a stamp.  I'm an artist who's great at<br/>
drawing, bad at carving.  I'm also a perfectionist and want my stamps to be<br/>
at least as good as I can make them.  So that means that I perhaps go out<br/>
searching for a few less letterboxes in order to have the extra time to do<br/>
some carving.  Or, instead of making and planting 3 boxes, I might make and<br/>
plant 2 boxes, and take time and a half on carving the stamps on those two<br/>
boxes.   It's totally do-able.  *If* a person wants to do it.  Saying they<br/>
don't have the time doesn't compute.  Saying they don't want to *take* the<br/>
time is much more like it.<br/>
<br/>
The same as the person who posted that they're holding down two jobs (so am<br/>
I), doing a bunch of volunteer work (so am I), etc.  Again, if they have the<br/>
time to go looking for boxes or the time to plant boxes with store-bought<br/>
stamps, then they *do* have the *time* to work on making unique stamps.<br/>
Their priority just isn't there, that's all.  But they *do* have the time if<br/>
they wanted to have the time.  They would be spending less time on finding<br/>
boxes or maybe planting less boxes, that's all.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, when an opinion is asked for, I give my opinion.  You're<br/>
totally free to give yours.  I'm no "Silverback".  I've been doing this 4<br/>
years or so now, maybe 5 at the very most.  Other family members have been<br/>
doing it a *lot* longer, but that's in the UK, and, tho I love a lot of the<br/>
stamps in the UK, clues are too boring and I couldn't take it for long, so I<br/>
didn't and don't box in the UK.  I just ooh and ahh over their journals and<br/>
admire the stamp images when I visit.  They search my bags when I leave to<br/>
be sure I'm not making off with any of their journals.  :-)<br/>

Hello Barefoot Lucy,<br/>
<br/>
When someone uses the phrase "In my never humble opinion" which Mosey used,<br/>
it sounds elitist. Like their opinion is the "rule". Just because someone is<br/>
considered a silverback or old-timer on the boards doesn't mean they can<br/>
push the newbies around. Tony was voicing an opinion and Mosey came back<br/>
with a flamed response about if someone has the time to go letterboxing then<br/>
they have the time and resources to get a hold of a hand carved stamp.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize if my disagreeing came off as not so humble as Mosey's post, I<br/>
really don't expect anyone to forgive me because well you know I'm a newbie<br/>
and not a silverback who knows it all.<br/>
<br/>
Barrudaki- Who thinks just because someone has been around doesn't mean they<br/>
have the right to boss people around.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; At the risk of sending this conversation over the edge to a full-fledged<br/>
&gt; flame war, I would like to gently point out that pointing fingers and<br/>
&gt; calling people elitist is not a way to foster conversation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would like to suggest looking at the discussion from a little different<br/>
&gt; angle - the folks who have been around awhile have learned the traditions<br/>
&gt; and "old ways" to play the game.  They often know the logic behind the<br/>
"why<br/>
&gt; nots" from a personal point of view.  New folks come in and have a great<br/>
&gt; deal of enthusiasm and literally ooze with new ideas.  I think both groups<br/>
&gt; of people are great!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, those who haven't been around forever and a day may need to<br/>
realize<br/>
&gt; that the old-timers - Silverbacks - have seen quite a few rounds of new<br/>
&gt; folks who have come in with grand ideas and some of those ideas have<br/>
&gt; degraded the hobby.  So if they just sit back and let the new folks run<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; over and do whatever they want to do without speaking up, the risk is that<br/>
&gt; the hobby becomes little more than collecting belly button lint.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps what you see as elitism is actually an effort to keep the<br/>
standards<br/>
&gt; high.  I think precious few folks on here would say that store-boughts are<br/>
&gt; NEVER okay or drive-by boxes are ALWAYS bad boxes, but by speaking out<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; why they don't like those, Silverbacks are trying to prevent the standards<br/>
&gt; from being lowered across the board.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A little tolerance all the way around would go a long way, but new folks -<br/>
&gt; respect those who have been at it for several years.  Silverbacks -<br/>
remember<br/>
&gt; you were new once too and didn't want to be discouraged on every turn!<br/>

&gt; Letterboxing<br/>
&gt; is near the top of my list of interests IF it means looking for a unique<br/>
&gt; stamp.  If it's a store-bought stamp, I have other things I'd rather do than<br/>
&gt; letterbox.  If there were only store-bought stamps, I wouldn't be a<br/>
&gt; letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
What makes you think that a hand-carved stamp is a guarantee of uniqueness?  Many people who carve their own stamps don't draw their own images, rather just use stock clip-art images.  I have personally found 2 hand-carved stamps with the exact same image, planted only a few hours from one another in Michigan.  It didn't really bother me one way or the other, actually I found it amusing, but I am assuming that following your logic this would be terribly disappointing to you and a waste of your time?<br/>
<br/>
There is such a wide variety of store-bought stamps available that I would think the chances of finding unique purchased stamps would be pretty good.  I am not advocating store-bought stamps because I enjoy seeing the creativity of hand-carved work, but I don't really get the attitude that a super crappy hand-carved stamp is better than an unique and artsy store-bought stamp or that store-bought stamps are the art of the devil.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that many people who plant a letterbox or two with store-bought stamps eventually decide to give carving a try.  My first few boxes had store-bought stamps -- 5 years ago it wasn't a big deal -- we just wanted boxes to find.  To this day I still get great comments on those boxes, which offer very scenic hikes in a great Lake Michigan park.  Coming across so negatively about store-boughts is very discouraging to new letterboxers who are caught up in the game but just not ready to try their hand at carving yet -- despite what you think, carving does not come easily to everyone and just because it seems natural to you, does not mean that is the case for everyone else.  I know of a letterboxing family that after finding several boxes over a period of about 6 months, excitedly purchased stamps, logbooks and boxes for their first plants, a 3-box series.  It was a neat idea for a series and the boxes were in some fun locations.  I was happy to hear that they had made the move<br/>
 from finders to planters (more boxes for me to find).  They had a great weekend running around planting their boxes and were excited about writing up the clues in a story.  About the same time, they joined up with one of the Yahoo groups, deciding they should get involved with their regional LB community now that they were "true" letterboxers (planters as well as finders).  After reading a string of posts slamming store-bought stamps, they decided to not even post the clues to their boxes, fearing that people would be disappointed and angry about finding their boxes with store-bought stamps.  I find it really sad that their enthusiasm for the hobby was squelched because of some narrow-minded attitudes.<br/>

To me it's the same thing. If it's a store bought I usualy don't even collect the image. Carving <br/>

someone took the time to sit down and actually carve it and make it their<br/>

<br/>
2.  There is no such thing as a unique purchased stamp from a store.  No<br/>
matter how one looks at it, they're mass-produced.  I don't mind a crappy<br/>
hand-carved stamp because, as I said in a previous post, I'm assuming that<br/>
the artist did give it their best shot.  Like someone else posted, some of<br/>
these "crappy" stamps are being made by very young children or people who<br/>
have disabilities but who still carve.  So crappy is all in the eye of the<br/>
beholder, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Carving does not come easily to me.  And since you're quoting my post, I<br/>
have to assume you're referring to me.  How many times have I said on this<br/>
list how difficult carving is for me???  I'll say it over and over again.<br/>
What some people can carve in 2 or 3 or 4 hours might take me a couple of<br/>
months of trying to carve.  That's why I make so few boxes.  It takes me<br/>
forever just to carve one stamp.  It's NOT easy for me.  My vision is shot<br/>
plus I've got fibromyalgia and three disintegrated discs in my back which<br/>
make sitting or standing in one position for any amount of time pretty<br/>
unbearable.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm sorry, I'm not going to apologize to anyone for the reason that I<br/>
box -- I don't box for the hike, I don't box for the fresh air, I don't box<br/>
to give the kiddies an activity to do, I don't box for the scenery, I box<br/>
for the stamp images -- and I'm not going to apologize to anyone for giving<br/>
my opinion if the question is asked because my opinion might make someone<br/>
feel badly.  Some original poster asked if people felt store-bought vs.<br/>
unique actually mattered.  That question comes up over and over again on the<br/>
list.  They ARE going to run into other boxers for whom the type of stamp<br/>
matters and boxers for whom it doesn't matter whatsoever.  If that stops<br/>
them from boxing, let's all just shove our opinions into a drawer and go on<br/>
home and not even have a list.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe whoever the listowner is should be "bossy" and make a rule stating<br/>
the question can no longer be asked so that it can no longer be answered.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing<br/>
&gt; is near the top of my list of interests IF it means looking for a unique<br/>
&gt; stamp.  If it's a store-bought stamp, I have other things I'd rather do<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; letterbox.  If there were only store-bought stamps, I wouldn't be a<br/>
&gt; letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
What makes you think that a hand-carved stamp is a guarantee of uniqueness?<br/>
Many people who carve their own stamps don't draw their own images, rather<br/>
just use stock clip-art images.  I have personally found 2 hand-carved<br/>
stamps with the exact same image, planted only a few hours from one another<br/>
in Michigan.  It didn't really bother me one way or the other, actually I<br/>
found it amusing, but I am assuming that following your logic this would be<br/>
terribly disappointing to you and a waste of your time?<br/>
<br/>
There is such a wide variety of store-bought stamps available that I would<br/>
think the chances of finding unique purchased stamps would be pretty good.<br/>
I am not advocating store-bought stamps because I enjoy seeing the<br/>
creativity of hand-carved work, but I don't really get the attitude that a<br/>
super crappy hand-carved stamp is better than an unique and artsy<br/>
store-bought stamp or that store-bought stamps are the art of the devil.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that many people who plant a letterbox or two with store-bought<br/>
stamps eventually decide to give carving a try.  My first few boxes had<br/>
store-bought stamps -- 5 years ago it wasn't a big deal -- we just wanted<br/>
boxes to find.  To this day I still get great comments on those boxes, which<br/>
offer very scenic hikes in a great Lake Michigan park.  Coming across so<br/>
negatively about store-boughts is very discouraging to new letterboxers who<br/>
are caught up in the game but just not ready to try their hand at carving<br/>
yet -- despite what you think, carving does not come easily to everyone and<br/>
just because it seems natural to you, does not mean that is the case for<br/>
everyone else.  I know of a letterboxing family that after finding several<br/>
boxes over a period of about 6 months, excitedly purchased stamps, logbooks<br/>
and boxes for their first plants, a 3-box series.  It was a neat idea for a<br/>
series and the boxes were in some fun locations.  I was happy to hear that<br/>
they had made the move<br/>
 from finders to planters (more boxes for me to find).  They had a great<br/>
weekend running around planting their boxes and were excited about writing<br/>
up the clues in a story.  About the same time, they joined up with one of<br/>
the Yahoo groups, deciding they should get involved with their regional LB<br/>
community now that they were "true" letterboxers (planters as well as<br/>
finders).  After reading a string of posts slamming store-bought stamps,<br/>
they decided to not even post the clues to their boxes, fearing that people<br/>
would be disappointed and angry about finding their boxes with store-bought<br/>
stamps.  I find it really sad that their enthusiasm for the hobby was<br/>
squelched because of some narrow-minded attitudes.<br/>

&gt; Don't have a problem with a different opinion, but if you are going to act <br/>
&gt; like your opinion is the word of the allmighty then don't expect your "never <br/>
&gt; so humble opinion" to really be heard. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your never so humble opinion from your original post didn't leave room for <br/>
&gt; some with disability (funny how your response does now), nor does it leave <br/>
&gt; room for someone who maybe doesn't have the money or passion to spend on a <br/>
&gt; company to make their stamp. Your never so humble opinion also does not <br/>
&gt; leave room for someone who is just starting out and may not have your <br/>
&gt; connections to get someone to carve them a stamp. Your never so humble <br/>
&gt; opinion has been noted and I responded in a not so humble way to it. If you <br/>
&gt; don't like how I responded then maybe you should look closer at how you <br/>
&gt; boast your never humble opinion. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are several reasons why someone may decide to use a store bought stamp <br/>
&gt; despite your never so humble opinion. You obviously have your way about how <br/>
&gt; things should be and others have their ways. I was and still am looking <br/>
&gt; forward to other people's opinions about store bought stamps however, post <br/>

&gt; &gt; There's nothing elitist about it. Why, when someone's opinion doesn't <br/>
&gt; match <br/>
&gt; &gt; someone else's opinion, is the first person's opinion suddenly elitist? <br/>
&gt; &gt; It's my opinion, based on what I like about letterboxing. And for what <br/>
&gt; it's <br/>
&gt; &gt; worth, stamps can be very cheap to have a company make. nwstamps.com can <br/>
&gt; &gt; often make them up for less than they can be bought at Hobby Lobby if a <br/>
&gt; &gt; person emails them their drawing. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just because a stamp is "no longer in print" (I'm not sure how a stamp can <br/>
&gt; &gt; be "in print" anyway but I'll use that phrase since you did), doesn't mean <br/>
&gt; &gt; there aren't an awfully lot of 'em out there. But that doesn't matter. <br/>
&gt; It <br/>
&gt; &gt; might be no longer "in print" but I probably have one of 'em. It's still <br/>
&gt; not <br/>
&gt; &gt; a unique stamp. It was mass produced at some point by someone who had <br/>
&gt; &gt; nothing to do with letterboxing. I don't care to find those kinds of <br/>
&gt; &gt; stamps. That's my opinion. Your mileage may certainly vary. Heck, if <br/>
&gt; &gt; it's "a poochie stamp from the 80s", I probably have it already. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If I had a disability that kept me from carving a stamp by myself, I <br/>
&gt; would, <br/>
&gt; &gt; as I suggested in my post, find someone interested in collaborating with <br/>
&gt; me <br/>
&gt; &gt; in making boxes. That's assuming that my disability allowed me to plant <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxes at all. There do happen to be folks around that like the <br/>
&gt; &gt; carving aspect but don't like the planting part of it. But I also don't <br/>
&gt; &gt; really think I'd mind cuttin' a person like that some slack. <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, <br/>
&gt; &gt; those don't exactly seem to be the folks placing the store-bought stamps <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; the most part. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Right now there are plenty of different styles of boxing around that folks <br/>
&gt; &gt; can pick and choose what they like. But the way it's been headed, I'm not <br/>
&gt; &gt; all that sure that's going to last. We don't have "thousands" of boxes in <br/>
&gt; &gt; this neck of the woods, and many many more new folks are going the <br/>
&gt; &gt; store-bought route 'round here. I can foresee that ending up being <br/>
&gt; &gt; considered the "norm". And that's OK -- I just won't be boxing anymore <br/>
&gt; &gt; then. I neither live to box nor box to live. :-) <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If you notice, on this list, I rarely give an opinion unless an opinion is <br/>
&gt; &gt; requested in a post. But if someone is going to ask a question and wants <br/>
&gt; &gt; opinions, then sorry, yes, I feel I have a right to give my opinion. I <br/>
&gt; &gt; guess you'd just rather hear the opinions from the folks who love <br/>
&gt; &gt; store-bought stamps. Oh well. If you don't like it, hit that good ol' <br/>
&gt; &gt; delete button when you see my email addy pop up. Unless ya do that, <br/>
&gt; you'll <br/>
&gt; &gt; be listening to my opinion when a request for opinions pops up. Sorry <br/>
&gt; 'bout <br/>
&gt; &gt; that. Nah.........really I'm not. <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Wow Mosey, I mean wow. Heaven forbid the placer of a box has some <br/>
&gt; disability <br/>
&gt; &gt; that would keep them from carving a stamp and maybe they don't have your <br/>
&gt; &gt; connection or money to have someone else or a company make their stamp for <br/>
&gt; &gt; them. In my not so humble opinion that is a really high horsed position <br/>
&gt; you <br/>
&gt; &gt; have there. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My first box was DARE I say a store bought stamp. It was store bought <br/>
&gt; &gt; because *I* liked the stamp and felt it was appropriate for the location. <br/>
&gt; &gt; DARE I say I helped my fiancee place her letterbox with a NO LONGER IN <br/>
&gt; PRINT <br/>
&gt; &gt; store bought stamp or that she uses another NO LONGER IN PRINT store <br/>
&gt; bought <br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp for her regular stamp. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Heaven forbid someone uses a poochie stamp from the 80's to place in their <br/>
&gt; &gt; box instead of a hand carved stamp. You know sometimes, just sometimes a <br/>
&gt; &gt; store bought stamp can be just as good or better than a carved stamp <br/>
&gt; because <br/>
&gt; &gt; it still can be a rare find. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Lucky there are thousands of DIFFERENT letterboxes to chose from and <br/>
&gt; &gt; thankfully not all the placer go by "I'm better than you elitist rules". <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Barrudaki- Who's really getting tired of the elitist attitude some people <br/>
&gt; &gt; display when it comes to a "Hobby" and who is happy there are an array of <br/>
&gt; &gt; varying letterbox placers who can find creative ways to contribute that <br/>
&gt; &gt; don't always rely on the stamp. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If people have the time to go out letterboxing, then they have "the <br/>
&gt; time, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; patience, or minimum amount of skill" to either hand-carve a unique <br/>
&gt; stamp <br/>
&gt; &gt; or <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; do a unique drawing and send it off to a stamp company to have them make <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stamp. That's letterboxing -- in my never humble opinion. It's a <br/>
&gt; matter <br/>
&gt; &gt; of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; priorities. Make fewer boxes then and take some of the extra time you <br/>
&gt; &gt; then <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have to do some artwork on your stamps. (Or even colaborate with <br/>
&gt; someone <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; who likes to carve but hates to find hiding spots and devise clues and <br/>
&gt; &gt; make <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it a team effort.) <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The game/sport/pasttime/hobby, to me, is the *total* idea. Your idea is <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sort of like going out to play baseball but someone stole ball. Sure, <br/>
&gt; you <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; could go out there to the pitcher's mound and pretend to throw a curve <br/>
&gt; &gt; ball <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and someone could stand at the plate and pretend to hit that curve ball <br/>
&gt; &gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; then someone could stand out in the outfield and pretend to catch that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ball.........but it's not a very thrilling idea. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure, I get terribly upset when one of my letterboxes disappears. <br/>
&gt; There's <br/>
&gt; &gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; good chance one just recently disappeared.........and it won't be my <br/>
&gt; first <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and it won't be my last. Far from it. I stomp my feet and throw myself <br/>
&gt; &gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the floor and flail my arms &amp; kick my legs, while my dogs give me the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; strangest of looks...........ooooooh lookee there, lookee lookee, mum's <br/>
&gt; &gt; gone <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; off the deep end again........and then I get over it. So what? Would <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Michelangelo have been terribly angry to have found one of his <br/>
&gt; &gt; masterpieces <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; destroyed? Meaning at the hand of someone other than himself? I would <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; think so. Would it stop him from still doing his best the next time <br/>
&gt; &gt; around. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Would it stop him from creating? I don't think so. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, finding a location and devising clues is a fair job in itself. <br/>
&gt; Done <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; right, it should be. But it's only *part* of the "job", so you get no <br/>
&gt; &gt; Wilke <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; button (I'm probably seriously dating myself here) from me for a job <br/>
&gt; &gt; *half* <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; well-done. Letterboxing, in my never humble opinion, is art. Anything <br/>
&gt; &gt; less <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; should be sittin' in a garage sale someplace where they sell those cheap <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; prints of cigar-smokin' dogs playin' poker that I refuse to allow in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; house. <br/>

Then I could understand why they might have to go with a store-bought stamp.<br/>

handicap can be overcome. It's seems more a matter to me of do they want to<br/>

telling anyone that they *must* overcome a handicap. But, on the other<br/>
hand, they also can't tell me that I *must* wish to look for their box.<br/>
Letterboxing, to me, is art. For me, that's what sets it apart from<br/>
geocaching. Not the difference between trinkets and stamps, but the<br/>
difference between trinkets and art. It can be art by a single person, or<br/>
it can be a collaboration, but store-bought stamps are not art to me.<br/>
<br/>
And, frankly, the boxers who seem to bring up disabilities as a reason for<br/>
using store-bought stasmps never really seem to be the ones *with* those<br/>
disabilities. Or maybe they're disabled and just not saying so. There's<br/>
absolutely no way, of course, of actually knowing what the statistics are,<br/>
but I've got a teeny tiny sneaky hunch that there aren't all *that* many<br/>
store-bought stamp letterboxes sitting out there placed by disabled boxers<br/>
who are disabled in such a way that they feel they have to go with a<br/>
store-bought stamp. :-)<br/>

So here's another opinion.. also not so humble...<br/>
<br/>
I would prefer not to find store bought stamps. If I want those images, I<br/>
can go and buy them from the art store. It is the heart that a person puts<br/>
into a stamp that makes it special to me. AND, the disability bit isn't<br/>
buying it for me. I have taught young children to carve, one as young as 3<br/>
years old. I know people who carve that are legally blind. I know people<br/>
that carve that have severe arthritis. It takes different skills and<br/>
different levels of "finesse" but you know what, I love them all.<br/>

Those are my feelings exactly, there are boxers out there that are just getting into planting boxes and are maybe using store bought stamps for their first box. My first box is a store bought stamp because I felt it went with the location. I also wanted the experience to be a learning expereince about planting my next boxes. I do happen to think each box planting is a learning experience that can be used to help the planter grow with the hobby. The planter gets feedback from others good, bad, constructive, or not so constructive and they can use that feedback to help shape the adventure for their next planting. <br/>
<br/>
It's obvious on the list people differ about how emersed someone should get into letterboxing. Some think you should do it their way from the get go don't bother learning anything else, while others like the idea of growing, branching out and trying different things, even if someone blast them because their idea differs from another. <br/>
<br/>
I hope your friends do end up planting their letterboxes even if they are using *gasp* store bought stamps. <br/>

&gt; Letterboxing<br/>
&gt; is near the top of my list of interests IF it means looking for a unique<br/>
&gt; stamp. If it's a store-bought stamp, I have other things I'd rather do than<br/>
&gt; letterbox. If there were only store-bought stamps, I wouldn't be a<br/>
&gt; letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
What makes you think that a hand-carved stamp is a guarantee of uniqueness? Many people who carve their own stamps don't draw their own images, rather just use stock clip-art images. I have personally found 2 hand-carved stamps with the exact same image, planted only a few hours from one another in Michigan. It didn't really bother me one way or the other, actually I found it amusing, but I am assuming that following your logic this would be terribly disappointing to you and a waste of your time?<br/>
<br/>
There is such a wide variety of store-bought stamps available that I would think the chances of finding unique purchased stamps would be pretty good. I am not advocating store-bought stamps because I enjoy seeing the creativity of hand-carved work, but I don't really get the attitude that a super crappy hand-carved stamp is better than an unique and artsy store-bought stamp or that store-bought stamps are the art of the devil.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that many people who plant a letterbox or two with store-bought stamps eventually decide to give carving a try. My first few boxes had store-bought stamps -- 5 years ago it wasn't a big deal -- we just wanted boxes to find. To this day I still get great comments on those boxes, which offer very scenic hikes in a great Lake Michigan park. Coming across so negatively about store-boughts is very discouraging to new letterboxers who are caught up in the game but just not ready to try their hand at carving yet -- despite what you think, carving does not come easily to everyone and just because it seems natural to you, does not mean that is the case for everyone else. I know of a letterboxing family that after finding several boxes over a period of about 6 months, excitedly purchased stamps, logbooks and boxes for their first plants, a 3-box series. It was a neat idea for a series and the boxes were in some fun locations. I was happy to hear that they had made the move<br/>
from finders to planters (more boxes for me to find). They had a great weekend running around planting their boxes and were excited about writing up the clues in a story. About the same time, they joined up with one of the Yahoo groups, deciding they should get involved with their regional LB community now that they were "true" letterboxers (planters as well as finders). After reading a string of posts slamming store-bought stamps, they decided to not even post the clues to their boxes, fearing that people would be disappointed and angry about finding their boxes with store-bought stamps. I find it really sad that their enthusiasm for the hobby was squelched because of some narrow-minded attitudes.<br/>

<br/>
I'm one of those people who don't hand carve stamps, and probably <br/>
never will. I'm not artistic and don't want to put out a "crappy <br/>
hand-carved stamp." However, all of my clues indicate that my stamps <br/>
are store bought. Hopefully that helps people decide whether or not <br/>
to go on the hunt for my boxes. I have to say, not once in any of my <br/>
logbooks has anyone said anything negative about the stamp, just <br/>
positive statements about how they loved the hike or the area I <br/>
planted in. <br/>
<br/>
I know on AQ, there is an icon that can be used to let the finder <br/>
know what type of stamp is in the box, That doesn't exist on LbNA, <br/>
but like I said earlier, I just list that it is a store-bought stamp <br/>
in the clues. No big deal to do it, and it may keep people from <br/>
being frustrated in the end. <br/>

Good hunting all, <br/>

few hours from one another in Michigan. It didn't really bother me <br/>
one way or the other, actually I found it amusing, but I am assuming <br/>
that following your logic this would be terribly disappointing to <br/>
you and a waste of your time?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is such a wide variety of store-bought stamps available that <br/>
I would think the chances of finding unique purchased stamps would <br/>
be pretty good. I am not advocating store-bought stamps because I <br/>
enjoy seeing the creativity of hand-carved work, but I don't really <br/>
get the attitude that a super crappy hand-carved stamp is better <br/>
than an unique and artsy store-bought stamp or that store-bought <br/>
stamps are the art of the devil.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also think that many people who plant a letterbox or two with <br/>
store-bought stamps eventually decide to give carving a try. My <br/>
first few boxes had store-bought stamps -- 5 years ago it wasn't a <br/>
big deal -- we just wanted boxes to find. To this day I still get <br/>
great comments on those boxes, which offer very scenic hikes in a <br/>
great Lake Michigan park. Coming across so negatively about store-<br/>
boughts is very discouraging to new letterboxers who are caught up <br/>
in the game but just not ready to try their hand at carving yet -- <br/>
despite what you think, carving does not come easily to everyone and <br/>
just because it seems natural to you, does not mean that is the case <br/>
for everyone else. I know of a letterboxing family that after <br/>
finding several boxes over a period of about 6 months, excitedly <br/>
purchased stamps, logbooks and boxes for their first plants, a 3-box <br/>
series. It was a neat idea for a series and the boxes were in some <br/>
fun locations. I was happy to hear that they had made the move<br/>
&gt; from finders to planters (more boxes for me to find). They had a <br/>
great weekend running around planting their boxes and were excited <br/>
about writing up the clues in a story. About the same time, they <br/>
joined up with one of the Yahoo groups, deciding they should get <br/>
involved with their regional LB community now that they were "true" <br/>
letterboxers (planters as well as finders). After reading a string <br/>
of posts slamming store-bought stamps, they decided to not even post <br/>
the clues to their boxes, fearing that people would be disappointed <br/>
and angry about finding their boxes with store-bought stamps. I find <br/>
it really sad that their enthusiasm for the hobby was squelched <br/>
because of some narrow-minded attitudes.<br/>

This always seems to be such an interesting topic, and I really <br/>
don't know why people get so up in arms over this.<br/>
<br/>
I'm one of those people who don't hand carve stamps, and probably <br/>
never will. I'm not artistic and don't want to put out a "crappy <br/>
hand-carved stamp." However, all of my clues indicate that my stamps <br/>
are store bought. Hopefully that helps people decide whether or not <br/>
to go on the hunt for my boxes. I have to say, not once in any of my <br/>
logbooks has anyone said anything negative about the stamp, just <br/>
positive statements about how they loved the hike or the area I <br/>
planted in. <br/>
<br/>
I know on AQ, there is an icon that can be used to let the finder <br/>
know what type of stamp is in the box, That doesn't exist on LbNA, <br/>
but like I said earlier, I just list that it is a store-bought stamp <br/>
in the clues. No big deal to do it, and it may keep people from <br/>
being frustrated in the end. <br/>
<br/>
Good hunting all, <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Those are my feelings exactly, there are boxers out there that are <br/>
just getting into planting boxes and are maybe using store bought <br/>
stamps for their first box. My first box is a store bought stamp <br/>
because I felt it went with the location. I also wanted the <br/>
experience to be a learning expereince about planting my next boxes. <br/>
I do happen to think each box planting is a learning experience that <br/>
can be used to help the planter grow with the hobby. The planter <br/>
gets feedback from others good, bad, constructive, or not so <br/>
constructive and they can use that feedback to help shape the <br/>
adventure for their next planting. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's obvious on the list people differ about how emersed someone <br/>
should get into letterboxing. Some think you should do it their way <br/>
from the get go don't bother learning anything else, while others <br/>
like the idea of growing, branching out and trying different things, <br/>
even if someone blast them because their idea differs from another. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope your friends do end up planting their letterboxes even if <br/>
they are using *gasp* store bought stamps. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Letterboxing<br/>
&gt; &gt; is near the top of my list of interests IF it means looking for <br/>
a unique<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp. If it's a store-bought stamp, I have other things I'd <br/>

&gt; &gt; letterbox. If there were only store-bought stamps, I wouldn't be <br/>
a<br/>

<br/>
If it's mostly about the hike and visiting new places then the finder might not care what type of stamp is in the box. <br/>
<br/>
If it's about collecting personal bits of one-of-a-kind art, then the carved stamp image will be very important to that finder. <br/>
<br/>
One way that the hider can garner the right audience for their box is to provide enough information in the clues so the finder can make the right choice that suits their letterboxing personality. I think most of the folks who confessed to being disappointed by store bought stamps were disappointed because it was a surprise - either the clues didn't mention what type of stamp was in the box, or the clues indicated a hand-carved stamp but the box contained a store bought stamp. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I never suggested I was the one with a disability, I was offering it as maybe a reason not an excuse for using store bought stamps. It is nice to know there are people who think a disability is an excuse though, gives an insight to their frame of mind. <br/>
<br/>
The reason I gave that suggestion was because there are other reason other than doing something "half-way". There are plenty of reasons why someone would choose, oh my that's an unusual word to use in this debate, choose. <br/>
<br/>
1. Yes the person may not have blocks of time to carve a stamp, they maybe able to sit down for 3 to 4 hours at a time to carve a stamp and if they do stumble upon a block of time then it is their choice (wow there is another variation of that word again.) to use that time on something else, hmmm maybe catching up on something else that isn't letterboxing. (Oh my you mean there are people out there who think about more than letterboxing in their spare time.) <br/>
<br/>
2. Maybe someone does have a disability that cripples the use of their hands. Just because it's not on an "approved" list some where doesn't mean it just an excuse to get out do doing something. I.E. how would you recommend someone with severe cerbal palsy who's hands are permantely in a fist and their thumb are turned in wards. I know what you are thinking, that person probably wouldn't be letterboxing because they can't walk. However, the person may not be able to walk but they do have a wheel chair that allows them go over rugged terrain, they maybe more limited than others on the type of letterboxes they can find but are they some how less of a letterboxer because of it? Again maybe they don't have the connection, money, etc to get an stamp done for them, now what they shouldn't bother planting a box because it's not up to someone else's standards? <br/>
<br/>
3. Maybe the planter actually liked the store bought stamp a thought it would be good in a letter box. Sure a finder can go buy the stamp if they want the image, but really would you pay the 7,8,9 dollars for the image when you can go get it for free because someone planted it. <br/>
<br/>
4. The planter could have it as a temp until they carve their stamp, may they were anxious to place a box and wanted to get the experience of planting a box and getting feedback for it. <br/>
<br/>
5. Maybe the planter has a different opinion about letterboxing and thinks the journey is more important than hoarding stamps, so the stamp by personal choice of the planter (wow there's that word again), has a store bought stamp.<br/>
<br/>
6. The planter is new and is trying different things like planting the box for scenery first and working from there. Maybe the next  box will have the combo of location of hand-carved stamp and scenery and the next location, hand-carved stamp, and intersting directions, etc, etc. getting into it little by little finding out what works for them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please bare in mind these are ONLY SOME reason that MAYBE considered when using a store bought stamp. I, myself, use store bought stamps, I also have carved stamps. I don't see a problem with using store bought stamps and I never will, I really don't care what reason someone may have for using store bought stamp, just like I don't care if someone uses a hand-carved stamp. If someone wants to venture into carving good for them. <br/>
<br/>
Opinions aren't meant to make someone feel bad, it's funny how people seem to hide behind a statement claiming it's an opinion to chastise or belittle someone.If someone wants to word their opinion in a way that it does cause hurt feelings then maybe they shouldn't be so thin skinned when someone calls them out on it.<br/>
<br/>
To everyone on the list I myself do apologize for the long winded responses, this whole thing happens to come on the heels of me going to a LBNA event and getting bullied, chastised, and yelled at because I was new, didn't have a P.T, used a store bought stamp and wrote my trail name instead of having everything on a hand carved stamp. I was yelled at by someone because according to them I absolutely had to change my stamp because their friend was using the exact same stamp and her friend obviously was using it first. The event was  a real eye opener for me, there were other more friendly people there but sometimes the saying is true too many bad apples spoils the bunch.<br/>

&gt; Don't have a problem with a different opinion, but if you are going to act<br/>
&gt; like your opinion is the word of the allmighty then don't expect your<br/>
"never<br/>
&gt; so humble opinion" to really be heard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Your never so humble opinion from your original post didn't leave room for<br/>
&gt; some with disability (funny how your response does now), nor does it leave<br/>
&gt; room for someone who maybe doesn't have the money or passion to spend on a<br/>
&gt; company to make their stamp. Your never so humble opinion also does not<br/>
&gt; leave room for someone who is just starting out and may not have your<br/>
&gt; connections to get someone to carve them a stamp. Your never so humble<br/>
&gt; opinion has been noted and I responded in a not so humble way to it. If<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; don't like how I responded then maybe you should look closer at how you<br/>
&gt; boast your never humble opinion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are several reasons why someone may decide to use a store bought<br/>
stamp<br/>
&gt; despite your never so humble opinion. You obviously have your way about<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; things should be and others have their ways. I was and still am looking<br/>
&gt; forward to other people's opinions about store bought stamps however, post<br/>
&gt; like yours will not help to swade my opinion about certain types of<br/>
stamps.<br/>
&gt; Those type of elitist "never so humble" opinions post only tells me the<br/>
&gt; person behind it is too bent on voicing "their way" and is too close<br/>
minded<br/>
&gt; to see how other ways may work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; There's nothing elitist about it. Why, when someone's opinion doesn't<br/>
&gt; match<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone else's opinion, is the first person's opinion suddenly elitist?<br/>
&gt; &gt; It's my opinion, based on what I like about letterboxing. And for what<br/>
&gt; it's<br/>
&gt; &gt; worth, stamps can be very cheap to have a company make. nwstamps.com can<br/>
&gt; &gt; often make them up for less than they can be bought at Hobby Lobby if a<br/>
&gt; &gt; person emails them their drawing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just because a stamp is "no longer in print" (I'm not sure how a stamp<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; &gt; be "in print" anyway but I'll use that phrase since you did), doesn't<br/>
mean<br/>
&gt; &gt; there aren't an awfully lot of 'em out there. But that doesn't matter.<br/>
&gt; It<br/>
&gt; &gt; might be no longer "in print" but I probably have one of 'em. It's still<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; a unique stamp. It was mass produced at some point by someone who had<br/>
&gt; &gt; nothing to do with letterboxing. I don't care to find those kinds of<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamps. That's my opinion. Your mileage may certainly vary. Heck, if<br/>
&gt; &gt; it's "a poochie stamp from the 80s", I probably have it already.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If I had a disability that kept me from carving a stamp by myself, I<br/>
&gt; would,<br/>
&gt; &gt; as I suggested in my post, find someone interested in collaborating with<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; &gt; in making boxes. That's assuming that my disability allowed me to plant<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxes at all. There do happen to be folks around that like the<br/>
&gt; &gt; carving aspect but don't like the planting part of it. But I also don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; really think I'd mind cuttin' a person like that some slack.<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately,<br/>
&gt; &gt; those don't exactly seem to be the folks placing the store-bought stamps<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the most part.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Right now there are plenty of different styles of boxing around that<br/>
folks<br/>
&gt; &gt; can pick and choose what they like. But the way it's been headed, I'm<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; &gt; all that sure that's going to last. We don't have "thousands" of boxes<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; this neck of the woods, and many many more new folks are going the<br/>
&gt; &gt; store-bought route 'round here. I can foresee that ending up being<br/>
&gt; &gt; considered the "norm". And that's OK -- I just won't be boxing anymore<br/>
&gt; &gt; then. I neither live to box nor box to live. :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you notice, on this list, I rarely give an opinion unless an opinion<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &gt; requested in a post. But if someone is going to ask a question and wants<br/>
&gt; &gt; opinions, then sorry, yes, I feel I have a right to give my opinion. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; guess you'd just rather hear the opinions from the folks who love<br/>
&gt; &gt; store-bought stamps. Oh well. If you don't like it, hit that good ol'<br/>
&gt; &gt; delete button when you see my email addy pop up. Unless ya do that,<br/>
&gt; you'll<br/>
&gt; &gt; be listening to my opinion when a request for opinions pops up. Sorry<br/>
&gt; 'bout<br/>
&gt; &gt; that. Nah.........really I'm not.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wow Mosey, I mean wow. Heaven forbid the placer of a box has some<br/>
&gt; disability<br/>
&gt; &gt; that would keep them from carving a stamp and maybe they don't have your<br/>
&gt; &gt; connection or money to have someone else or a company make their stamp<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; them. In my not so humble opinion that is a really high horsed position<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; have there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My first box was DARE I say a store bought stamp. It was store bought<br/>
&gt; &gt; because *I* liked the stamp and felt it was appropriate for the<br/>
location.<br/>
&gt; &gt; DARE I say I helped my fiancee place her letterbox with a NO LONGER IN<br/>
&gt; PRINT<br/>
&gt; &gt; store bought stamp or that she uses another NO LONGER IN PRINT store<br/>
&gt; bought<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp for her regular stamp.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Heaven forbid someone uses a poochie stamp from the 80's to place in<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; &gt; box instead of a hand carved stamp. You know sometimes, just sometimes a<br/>
&gt; &gt; store bought stamp can be just as good or better than a carved stamp<br/>
&gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt; it still can be a rare find.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lucky there are thousands of DIFFERENT letterboxes to chose from and<br/>
&gt; &gt; thankfully not all the placer go by "I'm better than you elitist rules".<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Barrudaki- Who's really getting tired of the elitist attitude some<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; &gt; display when it comes to a "Hobby" and who is happy there are an array<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; varying letterbox placers who can find creative ways to contribute that<br/>
&gt; &gt; don't always rely on the stamp.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If people have the time to go out letterboxing, then they have "the<br/>
&gt; time,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; patience, or minimum amount of skill" to either hand-carve a unique<br/>
&gt; stamp<br/>
&gt; &gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; do a unique drawing and send it off to a stamp company to have them<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stamp. That's letterboxing -- in my never humble opinion. It's a<br/>
&gt; matter<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; priorities. Make fewer boxes then and take some of the extra time you<br/>
&gt; &gt; then<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have to do some artwork on your stamps. (Or even colaborate with<br/>
&gt; someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; who likes to carve but hates to find hiding spots and devise clues and<br/>
&gt; &gt; make<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it a team effort.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The game/sport/pasttime/hobby, to me, is the *total* idea. Your idea<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sort of like going out to play baseball but someone stole ball. Sure,<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; could go out there to the pitcher's mound and pretend to throw a curve<br/>
&gt; &gt; ball<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and someone could stand at the plate and pretend to hit that curve<br/>
ball<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; then someone could stand out in the outfield and pretend to catch that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ball.........but it's not a very thrilling idea.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure, I get terribly upset when one of my letterboxes disappears.<br/>
&gt; There's<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; good chance one just recently disappeared.........and it won't be my<br/>
&gt; first<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and it won't be my last. Far from it. I stomp my feet and throw myself<br/>
&gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the floor and flail my arms &amp; kick my legs, while my dogs give me the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; strangest of looks...........ooooooh lookee there, lookee lookee,<br/>
mum's<br/>
&gt; &gt; gone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; off the deep end again........and then I get over it. So what? Would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Michelangelo have been terribly angry to have found one of his<br/>
&gt; &gt; masterpieces<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; destroyed? Meaning at the hand of someone other than himself? I would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; think so. Would it stop him from still doing his best the next time<br/>
&gt; &gt; around.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Would it stop him from creating? I don't think so.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, finding a location and devising clues is a fair job in itself.<br/>
&gt; Done<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; right, it should be. But it's only *part* of the "job", so you get no<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wilke<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; button (I'm probably seriously dating myself here) from me for a job<br/>
&gt; &gt; *half*<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; well-done. Letterboxing, in my never humble opinion, is art. Anything<br/>
&gt; &gt; less<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; should be sittin' in a garage sale someplace where they sell those<br/>
cheap<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; prints of cigar-smokin' dogs playin' poker that I refuse to allow in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; house.<br/>

There are many creative things that you can do with your letterbox  <br/>
but nothing beats a hand carved or uniquely designed stamps for me. I  <br/>
don't see that as elitist, just my experience.<br/>

&gt; &gt; company to make their stamp. Your never so humble opinion also does not<br/>
&gt; &gt; leave room for someone who is just starting out and may not have your<br/>
&gt; &gt; connections to get someone to carve them a stamp. Your never so humble<br/>
&gt; &gt; opinion has been noted and I responded in a not so humble way to it. If<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; don't like how I responded then maybe you should look closer at how you<br/>
&gt; &gt; boast your never humble opinion.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are several reasons why someone may decide to use a store bought<br/>
&gt; stamp<br/>
&gt; &gt; despite your never so humble opinion. You obviously have your way about<br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; &gt; things should be and others have their ways. I was and still am looking<br/>
&gt; &gt; forward to other people's opinions about store bought stamps however, post<br/>
&gt; &gt; like yours will not help to swade my opinion about certain types of<br/>
&gt; stamps.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Those type of elitist "never so humble" opinions post only tells me the<br/>
&gt; &gt; person behind it is too bent on voicing "their way" and is too close<br/>
&gt; minded<br/>
&gt; &gt; to see how other ways may work.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You can respond how you want I'll no longer be responding to this part of<br/>

&gt; &gt; -------------- Original message ----------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt; From: "xxxxxxxx"<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; There's nothing elitist about it. Why, when someone's opinion doesn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; match<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; someone else's opinion, is the first person's opinion suddenly elitist?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's my opinion, based on what I like about letterboxing. And for what<br/>
&gt; &gt; it's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; worth, stamps can be very cheap to have a company make. nwstamps.com can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; often make them up for less than they can be bought at Hobby Lobby if a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; person emails them their drawing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just because a stamp is "no longer in print" (I'm not sure how a stamp<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; be "in print" anyway but I'll use that phrase since you did), doesn't<br/>
&gt; mean<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there aren't an awfully lot of 'em out there. But that doesn't matter.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; might be no longer "in print" but I probably have one of 'em. It's still<br/>
&gt; &gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a unique stamp. It was mass produced at some point by someone who had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing to do with letterboxing. I don't care to find those kinds of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stamps. That's my opinion. Your mileage may certainly vary. Heck, if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's "a poochie stamp from the 80s", I probably have it already.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If I had a disability that kept me from carving a stamp by myself, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as I suggested in my post, find someone interested in collaborating with<br/>
&gt; &gt; me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in making boxes. That's assuming that my disability allowed me to plant<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxes at all. There do happen to be folks around that like the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; carving aspect but don't like the planting part of it. But I also don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; really think I'd mind cuttin' a person like that some slack.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; those don't exactly seem to be the folks placing the store-bought stamps<br/>
&gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the most part.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Right now there are plenty of different styles of boxing around that<br/>
&gt; folks<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; can pick and choose what they like. But the way it's been headed, I'm<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all that sure that's going to last. We don't have "thousands" of boxes<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this neck of the woods, and many many more new folks are going the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; store-bought route 'round here. I can foresee that ending up being<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; considered the "norm". And that's OK -- I just won't be boxing anymore<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; then. I neither live to box nor box to live. :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you notice, on this list, I rarely give an opinion unless an opinion<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; requested in a post. But if someone is going to ask a question and wants<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; opinions, then sorry, yes, I feel I have a right to give my opinion. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guess you'd just rather hear the opinions from the folks who love<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; store-bought stamps. Oh well. If you don't like it, hit that good ol'<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; delete button when you see my email addy pop up. Unless ya do that,<br/>
&gt; &gt; you'll<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; be listening to my opinion when a request for opinions pops up. Sorry<br/>
&gt; &gt; 'bout<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that. Nah.........really I'm not.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Wow Mosey, I mean wow. Heaven forbid the placer of a box has some<br/>
&gt; &gt; disability<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that would keep them from carving a stamp and maybe they don't have your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; connection or money to have someone else or a company make their stamp<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them. In my not so humble opinion that is a really high horsed position<br/>
&gt; &gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have there.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My first box was DARE I say a store bought stamp. It was store bought<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because *I* liked the stamp and felt it was appropriate for the<br/>
&gt; location.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; DARE I say I helped my fiancee place her letterbox with a NO LONGER IN<br/>
&gt; &gt; PRINT<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; store bought stamp or that she uses another NO LONGER IN PRINT store<br/>
&gt; &gt; bought<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stamp for her regular stamp.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Heaven forbid someone uses a poochie stamp from the 80's to place in<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; box instead of a hand carved stamp. You know sometimes, just sometimes a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; store bought stamp can be just as good or better than a carved stamp<br/>
&gt; &gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it still can be a rare find.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lucky there are thousands of DIFFERENT letterboxes to chose from and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thankfully not all the placer go by "I'm better than you elitist rules".<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Barrudaki- Who's really getting tired of the elitist attitude some<br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; display when it comes to a "Hobby" and who is happy there are an array<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; varying letterbox placers who can find creative ways to contribute that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't always rely on the stamp.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If people have the time to go out letterboxing, then they have "the<br/>
&gt; &gt; time,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; patience, or minimum amount of skill" to either hand-carve a unique<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do a unique drawing and send it off to a stamp company to have them<br/>
&gt; make<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stamp. That's letterboxing -- in my never humble opinion. It's a<br/>
&gt; &gt; matter<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; priorities. Make fewer boxes then and take some of the extra time you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; then<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to do some artwork on your stamps. (Or even colaborate with<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who likes to carve but hates to find hiding spots and devise clues and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; make<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it a team effort.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The game/sport/pasttime/hobby, to me, is the *total* idea. Your idea<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sort of like going out to play baseball but someone stole ball. Sure,<br/>
&gt; &gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could go out there to the pitcher's mound and pretend to throw a curve<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ball<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and someone could stand at the plate and pretend to hit that curve<br/>
&gt; ball<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then someone could stand out in the outfield and pretend to catch that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ball.........but it's not a very thrilling idea.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sure, I get terribly upset when one of my letterboxes disappears.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; good chance one just recently disappeared.........and it won't be my<br/>
&gt; &gt; first<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and it won't be my last. Far from it. I stomp my feet and throw myself<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the floor and flail my arms &amp; kick my legs, while my dogs give me the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; strangest of looks...........ooooooh lookee there, lookee lookee,<br/>
&gt; mum's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; gone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off the deep end again........and then I get over it. So what? Would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Michelangelo have been terribly angry to have found one of his<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; masterpieces<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destroyed? Meaning at the hand of someone other than himself? I would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think so. Would it stop him from still doing his best the next time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; around.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would it stop him from creating? I don't think so.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, finding a location and devising clues is a fair job in itself.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Done<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right, it should be. But it's only *part* of the "job", so you get no<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Wilke<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; button (I'm probably seriously dating myself here) from me for a job<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; *half*<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well-done. Letterboxing, in my never humble opinion, is art. Anything<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; less<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be sittin' in a garage sale someplace where they sell those<br/>
&gt; cheap<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prints of cigar-smokin' dogs playin' poker that I refuse to allow in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>

In no way am I saying that is elitist, however how the opinion is presented can be and that is where my post came from because a certain person thinks they can use their opinion as a weapon to brow beat someone into agreeing with them or make someone feel bad because they don't do something the same way as that peson.<br/>

&gt; There are many creative things that you can do with your letterbox  <br/>
&gt; but nothing beats a hand carved or uniquely designed stamps for me. I  <br/>
&gt; don't see that as elitist, just my experience.<br/>

You two have varying opinions- so what?? There's room here for lots of <br/>

tonight, but this is obviously going no where.<br/>
<br/>
You have an idea, someone else has an idea, some other third person <br/>

elitist or a snob, or who is to say who is an ignorant fool?<br/>

"Who's really getting tired of the elitist attitude some people display whenit comes to a "Hobby" and who is happy there are an array of varyingletterbox placers who can find creative ways to contribute that don't alwaysrely on the stamp."***************************At the risk of sending this conversation over the edge to a full-fledgedflame war, I would like to gently point out that pointing fingers andcalling people elitist is not a way to foster conversation.I would like to suggest looking at the discussion from a little differentangle - the folks who have been around awhile have learned the traditionsand "old ways" to play the game. They often know the logic behind the "whynots" from a personal point of view. New folks come in and have a greatdeal of enthusiasm and literally ooze with new ideas. I think both groupsof people are great!However, those who haven't been around forever and a day may need to realizethat the old-timers - Silverbacks - have seen quite a few rounds of newfolks who have come in with grand ideas and some of those ideas havedegraded the hobby. So if they just sit back and let the new folks run allover and do whatever they want to do without speaking up, the risk is thatthe hobby becomes little more than collecting belly button lint.Perhaps what you see as elitism is actually an effort to keep the standardshigh. I think precious few folks on here would say that store-boughts areNEVER okay or drive-by boxes are ALWAYS bad boxes, but by speaking out aboutwhy they don't like those, Silverbacks are trying to prevent the standardsfrom being lowered across the board.A little tolerance all the way around would go a long way, but new folks -respect those who have been at it for several years. Silverbacks - rememberyou were new once too and didn't want to be discouraged on every turn!-- Barefoot Lucy"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] <br/>

<br/>
If you find a letterbox hybrid where the coordinates take you to a parking lot or trailhead, then Google Maps would definitely work. Once you arrive at the starting point, you would follow the written directions in the write-up. Here's an example (it's in Yuba City):<br/>
http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=b17518ae-463d-4c4e-b471-17ddc2b6c17b<br/>
To find more geocache letterboxes in your area do an advanced search for 'letterboxes' by 'zipcode'. <br/>
<br/>
It might even work for regular geocaches, although I think it would be tough if the coordinates end up in the middle of the woods. I've only once tried to find a geocache without a GPS unit and I was successful, but I really knew the area well and knew exactly which bench they were describing in the clue.  I hear that there are geocachers who pride themselves in finding many caches without a GPS unit.   <br/>

 &gt;* Geocache - by latitude/longitude coordinates <br/>
 &gt;(e.g. N39 00.150 W121 25.860) and when you get <br/>
 &gt;close, by hints. Geocachers carry a GPS (Global <br/>
 &gt;Positioning System) receiver that guides them to the location.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey, R,,,<br/>
<br/>
 Those Lat/Long numbers seem to be just southeast <br/>
 of Yuba City, just off of highway 65, near the <br/>
 little community of Wheatland,,, which is a <br/>
 little above Sacremento,,, am I close???  I have <br/>
 no GPS, but ran the lat/long on Google Maps, and <br/>
 that's what came up.  Was thinking this might be <br/>
 a poor man's way of geocacheing.  :-)  At least <br/>
 until one can afford a GPS, of which I would <br/>
 imagine there's quite a number to choose from.<br/>
