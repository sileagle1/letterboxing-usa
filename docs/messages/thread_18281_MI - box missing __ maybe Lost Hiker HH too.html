Trails box so I could do a little maintance check.<br/>
<br/>
We found the box completely missing. No box, no baggies, no stamp or <br/>
logbook turned up in a search of the general area. I will be <br/>
replacing it, but I may adjust it's placement a bit.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter had placed the Lost Hiker HH (which was sent back from <br/>
Portland OR with me) into that box.  I don't know if the HH was <br/>
moved on before the box went MIA or not.<br/>
<br/>
MIA status for the Kent Trails box has been updated in the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
