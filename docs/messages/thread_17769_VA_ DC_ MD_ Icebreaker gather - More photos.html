Gather into the Icebreaker album of the Photos section.  <br/>

I am afraid I used up all the photo space.  I thought I could delete <br/>
the full size version of the pictures after uploading but can't <br/>
figure it out.  Now, of course, it won't let me do anything.  If the <br/>
moderators want to delete them all that's fine.  I can figure out how <br/>
to shrink the photos and start over.<br/>

If others can look at them I am looking for corrections and names.<br/>
