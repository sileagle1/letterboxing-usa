Presidential Series #2<br/>
March 22, 2003<br/>
Hope Brook Lake Park<br/>
Middlebury CT. New Haven County<br/>
5 boxes<br/>
<br/>
  **You can either begin this series at the point you finish series #1 or <br/>
you can drive into the park until you reach the lake. To the left is a small <br/>
parking lot right before you drive over a bridge if you park there and walk <br/>
over the bridge you will see a sign for the Upland Trail(with orange <br/>
blazes)follow that trail into the woods.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ronald Wilson Reagan<br/>
40th President 1981-1989<br/>
Republican<br/>
Vice President - George Bush<br/>
Born February 6, 1911 Tampico, Illinois<br/>
Occupation: Actor, Public Official<br/>
Married: Jane Wyman, Nancy Davis<br/>
<br/>
Early Years: Reagan went to school in Dixon, Illinois, and then to Eureke <br/>
College where he majored in economics. He had strong interests in sports, <br/>
drama and politics. Reagan became a Hollywood actor and made over fifty <br/>
movies.<br/>
<br/>
His Presidency: Under Reagan, defense spending and a tax cut led to a record <br/>
budget deficit. The national debt rose from $900 billion to more than $2 <br/>
trillion, but his leadership style raised the countries optimism about our <br/>
national strength. His foreign affairs policies were instrumental in ending <br/>
the cold war. Reagan's greatest achievement was the banning of <br/>
intermediate-range nuclear arms through a treaty with the Soviet Union in <br/>
1987.<br/>
<br/>
Did you know? Reagan was elected at age 70, making him our country's oldest <br/>
president.<br/>
<br/>
  **If you follow the Upland into the woods you will come across two <br/>
concrete drainage pipes. If you are picking up the trail from Pres. Series 1 <br/>
just keep following the trail until you come to the drainage pipes. Take a <br/>
compass reading of 90 east walk up the hill to the boulder with a tree <br/>
growing into it. On the back side of the boulder you will find Ronald <br/>
Reagan.<br/>
<br/>
George Bush<br/>
41st President 1989 - 1993<br/>
Republican<br/>
Vice President - Dan Quayle<br/>

Married: Barbara Pierce<br/>
<br/>
Early Years: Bush grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut. He attended Phillips <br/>
Academy in Massachusetts and served as a pilot in the Navy during World War <br/>
II. He then majored in economics at Yale and became a supplier of oil <br/>
drilling equipment.<br/>
<br/>
His Presidency: Bush faced problems of a huge national debt, the savings and <br/>
loan bailout, a sluggish economy and rising inflation. Budget problems and <br/>
taxes damaged his popularity, but his leadership in foreign affairs, <br/>
especially the Persian Gulf War in 1991, helped improve his image greatly. <br/>
He was not reelected, but remained active in politics.<br/>
<br/>
Did you know? Bush, at 19, became the youngest pilot to serve up to that <br/>
time in the U.S. Navy. He took part in 58 combat missions during WW II.<br/>
<br/>
  **Keep following the trail SE until you reach the junction of the Wetlands <br/>
Trail and the Uplands Trail. Take another compass reading of 90 degrees E. <br/>
Your next box is waiting, as the crow flies, in the rock outcroppings. Its <br/>
really neat at the top! When you see a u shaped rock with a tree growing in <br/>
it under the rock to the right of the tree the first George Bush will be.<br/>
<br/>
Richard M. Nixon<br/>
37th President 1969-1974<br/>

College, went to Duke University Law School on a scholarship and placed <br/>

<br/>
His Presidency: Under Nixon's administration, there was a cease-fire <br/>
agreement with Vietnam. Nixon began the Stratigic Arms Limitation Talks with <br/>

expert in international affairs.<br/>
<br/>
Did you know? Nixon was a Quaker, and his mother wanted him to become a <br/>
missionary.<br/>
<br/>
  **Go back down to the Upland Trail and follow it in a NE direction. The <br/>
Upland Trail is blazed with orange. The trail will begin to climb and at the <br/>
first crest to your left will be a rock with a flat side, like a slide. 6 <br/>
paces(left right left) past the rock is a blazed tree. Another 3 paces will <br/>
bring you to a group of rocks. On the west side of this group tucked inside <br/>
a little alcove is "Tricky Dick."<br/>
Return to the trail and keep heading up.<br/>

he received a law degree at Yale University.<br/>
<br/>
His Presidency: During his first term, Clinton's efforts centered around the <br/>
economy, health care reform and trade agreements with Mexico and Canada. But <br/>
foreign affairs often took center stage, as civil war rocked Eastern Europe <br/>
and American troops were dispatched to help keep the peace. During his <br/>
second term in office, enormous growth in Internet technology and the <br/>
economyled to a huge budget surplus. But in the last days of his Presidency, <br/>
foreign affairs again captured his attention as fighting erupted in the <br/>
explosive Middle East.<br/>
<br/>
Did you know? Clinton is a saxaphone player and the first president from the <br/>
"Baby Boom" generation.<br/>

facing the path your treasure awaits. Return to the trail and continue going <br/>
