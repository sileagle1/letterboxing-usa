for dates to meet. If we meet somewhere along the<br/>
Delaware Canal there are lots of boxes to stamp in on<br/>
the way to a restaurant. Raubsville Inn is roomy,quiet<br/>
and quaint. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds great by me, too.  The Raubsville Inn is very<br/>
nice, as is the Ship Inn (Milford, NJ)which is a bit<br/>
farther down Route 32 towards New Hope/Lambertsville.<br/>
<br/>
March 2 is great (we're busy on the 3rd)!  Hey, if we<br/>
go to Raubsville, someone can help us with the "Lock<br/>
21" box we couldn't find last fall!<br/>
<br/>
Ringing Rocks State Park is also nearby - found the<br/>
1st box, but got sick of the rain and didn't get to<br/>
the 2nd.<br/>
