Hello.  I am a new member to your group and letterboxing.  I have <br/>
been solving puzzles/riddles my whole life and love adventure, <br/>
Letterboxing seems to be the answer to my dreams!  My husband asked <br/>
me to marry him at the Knob in Woods Hole Cape Cod.  We will be <br/>
making our first letterbox hunt there next week and have created our <br/>
own stamp for the special occasion.  We look forward to many many <br/>
years of letterboxing and we hope to get to know all of you in <br/>
time.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone who is interested in treking to the Cape after reading the <br/>
article can feel free to contact us.  My husand was born and raised <br/>
on the Cape and could probably answer any questions that you may <br/>
have. I my self am from New Jersey.<br/>
