                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have been living in this adopted state for long enough to know of <br/>
the Ohio-Michigan rivalries.  <br/>
<br/>
The football teams and other sports teams of each state battle out <br/>
this rivalry every season of the year, but no more effectively than <br/>
during the fall.    <br/>
<br/>
In good natured fun, let me point out that the number of Ohio <br/>
letterboxes matched the number of Michigan boxes with the posting of <br/>
my latest box this afternoon. It is now 35 all.<br/>
<br/>
I have privately appreciated my established goal of exceeding <br/>
Michigan over the last few weeks.  Now if any intrepid Michigan <br/>
boxers would like to engage in the contest, I believe we have the <br/>
ball with a first down and two time outs remaining.<br/>
<br/>
If you take up the challenge, hurrah!  There will be more Michigan <br/>
boxes around, and I can take a trip there in the spring to stamp them <br/>
in.  Win-win!  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Randy's Note is well taken.  A number of other boxes may be in Ohio <br/>
of which I am presently unaware - perhaps even Michigan.  If anyone <br/>
is aware of letterboxes in Ohio/Ky/Michigan/Indiana listed on other <br/>
sites and not listed here, I would appreciate knowing about them so <br/>
that I can go find them.  No spoilers for national mystery boxes <br/>
though!<br/>
<br/>
Actually, my goal is not to match MI, rather CT. (We are only down a <br/>
couple hundred.  If we can get 8 more Ohio letterboxers to place <br/>
about 25 boxes we will be there.  No sweat! So many boxes to place <br/>
and find, so little time.  :D  <br/>
