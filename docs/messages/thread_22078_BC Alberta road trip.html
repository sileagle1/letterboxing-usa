                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just finished a road trip through BC and Alberta. Found two<br/>
letterboxes in lovely Waterton Lakes PArk. Awesome scenery, <br/>
aaah, the rockies are lovely. The letterboxes a deligtful and easy to<br/>
find. Thanks Silver Eagle and Little Bear.<br/>
Before we arrived there however we were able to plant a letterbox in<br/>
Rock Creek BC ( I think we called that one Rock Creek letterbox..aagh,<br/>
still unpacking and need to find our journal with the clues<br/>
etc.)(havent had a chance to post clues.) Then we planted a few more<br/>
in Alberta...<br/>
all stamps, other then the mystery one, were carved 'a la car'...hmmm,<br/>
couldn't resist that one. It is rather tricky putting them together<br/>
while we drive. Had originally left home with supplies for only two<br/>
boxes, then ran out. Quickly improvised.<br/>
We went by a town called Vulcan,<br/>
you treckies,<br/>
if you ever are there,<br/>
http://www.town.vulcan.ab.ca/<br/>
that is the town website<br/>
this would be the place for a great letterbox.<br/>
We had no idea and didnt even know of the town until we were upon it.<br/>
I can not carve a 'starship' on demand, so this town eagerly awaits a<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
it is a very out of the way town, ecxcept if you are driving back<br/>
roads to Drumheller.  There is a Vulcan Trekkie type science centre<br/>
and a model spaceship. Real cool. So this mission is purely for trekkies.<br/>
<br/>
We managed to plant in Arrowwood, (Alberta Grains letterbox)tried to<br/>
plant near a grain elevator as the prairies are dotted with these cool<br/>
structures.  Had to suffice with an interest point just at the highway<br/>
junction for this town.<br/>
Last two are planted on either sides of the historic site of<br/>
Drumheller Alberta. So if you ever are going to the Museum there, be<br/>
sure to check out the letterboxes.Horseshoe Canyon letterbox and our<br/>
mystery box, it really isn't that much of a mystery, but my dd really<br/>
wanted to plant a mystery one.<br/>
We could also recommend an awesome B&amp;B we happened upon in Drumheller.<br/>
<br/>
We had a wonderful time. Just wish we had supplies for about 15 more<br/>
boxes to plant on this trip as we saw so many cool sites.<br/>
Oh and the wildlife we saw. Bears (3 sitings) Deer and elk<br/>
(innumerable!!!!!) Big horn sheep, mountain goats, mountain sheep<br/>
and a zillion gophers, plus some marmots.<br/>
It was a memorable experience.<br/>
