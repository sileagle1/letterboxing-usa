<div>What do you think the difficulty of this box 
is--physically speaking? I will be in Newport Beach over Christmas and want to 
try finding as many local boxes as I can, since there are not many near my home 
in WI. I am most concerned about the part of your hike that includes "scrambling 
over rocks". Can you give some sort of rating for that? Thanks.

<br/>
Yes, my e-mail set up is on the fritz - Hopefully that e-mail address <br/>
will be working by tomorrow, Monday.<br/>
<br/>
It's a pretty easy up and back hike, 2 and a half miles round-trip <br/>
from the parking area to the falls and back.  There's about a 450 <br/>
foot elevation gain on the way up to the falls, so take your time <br/>
getting there; but you can fairly dance down on the way back.<br/>
<br/>
"Scrambling over rocks" is just walking over them, really.  I usually <br/>
carry a walking stick, but you'll just be walking up a 4-5 foot <br/>
incline that has some rocks on it.  On a 1 to 5 difficulty rating for <br/>
the hike, I'd give it a 1.5.<br/>
<br/>
If you do the hike in December, let me know if that little ballpark <br/>
guess-timate gauge was accurate.  It's not that difficult at all...<br/>
