Susan, our daughter  and I had an opportunity to look for Randy's "6<br/>
layers of History" Letterbox this past Wednesday, while on a trip to<br/>
take our daughter to college.<br/>
<br/>
We ended the drought by finding this Letterbox in a soaking downpour.<br/>
First, let me say, the clues were very well-done. Especially in<br/>
hindsight while slogging back to the car after the search.  We did, I<br/>
think, find all the landmarks - our daughter was the lucky box-finder. <br/>
<br/>
Lessons learned: letterbox hunters should keep ink-jet-printed clue<br/>
pages<br/>
in waterproof see-thru protection sleeves, as we were seriously in<br/>
danger of having the cryptic words first blur and smudge, then run down<br/>
our forearms into the historic clay. Also, carry an umbrella or other<br/>
shelter for the "stamping-up".<br/>
<br/>
I was very gratified at our daughter's persistance - Suzi and I were<br/>
wearing thin - she wouldn't let us quit (even after nearly 2 hours of<br/>
searching). <br/>
<br/>
The general area of the box has wonderful history to be learned and<br/>
savored - we will leave that for the next trip, as we were so cold and<br/>
wet that we all went to MacDonalds to use the hand blow-dryers,  not<br/>
limited to our hands. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this was a Dartmoor-typical experience? Cold, wet, slogging thru<br/>
all kinds of terrain, history all about, compass (and eyeglasses) too<br/>
wet  to really take bearings, finding the object of one's search just<br/>
minutes before one had decided to quit.<br/>
<br/>
This is nuts! But, really fun.<br/>
Thanks, Randy!<br/>

Ohh such joy .... I was beginning to think that it was all idyllic<br/>
letterboxing in LbNA land...<br/>
<br/>
Rain, rain and more rain is the normal boxers delight in Dartmoor...and I<br/>
am beginning to believe that I am some sort of rain magnet myself....so<br/>
it's great to hear about a soggy slog in the your magical letterboxing<br/>
land.<br/>
<br/>
..<br/>
..<br/>
..<br/>
&gt; our daughter was the lucky box-finder. <br/>
<br/>
Well..done....you dont say how old your daughter is...but I have always<br/>
advocated that it is a very handy letterboxing implement to take along ..<br/>
er that is I mean always "pack" a handy 10 - 15 year old.....they are very<br/>
"useful" to locate those boxes that the "more mature" boxers find<br/>
difficulty in bending down and seeking under rocks for ! <g><br/>
<br/>
My son (13) has the coined the expression..."boxious"....pronounced like<br/>
"anxious"..It means .."having the characteristics of a high state of<br/>
letterbox"   for example ..a location can be said to be 'boxious' if (say)<br/>
there are lots of very suitable rocks just aching to have a tupperware<br/>
letterbox slid under them...or a person my be said to be 'boxious' if they<br/>
display a nervous character in such locations...and have the tendency to<br/>
look under rocks and skip from rock to rock in a frenzied search<br/>
pattern.....now this is best controlled by the "use" of a active and<br/>
friendly son or daughter who is more able to assist in all this physical<br/>
exercise...<br/>
<br/>
My ideal is to arrive at a boxious location ..set up my folding directors<br/>
chair and ..sitting in the warm sun sipping my tea..set to directing my<br/>
son as he scrambles over the rockfield seeking the boxes whilst I<br/>
"helpfully" point here and there..maybe take a bearing or two and offer<br/>
encouraging advice...<very big="" grin=""><br/>
<br/>
But then it isn't like that actually....it's normally "raining" and Dad<br/>
has to keep looking else No. 1 son gets to moaning, "Dad you're not<br/>
looking hard enough !"  so my ideal will never be achieved I fear !<br/>
<br/>

&gt;our forearms into the historic clay. Also, carry an umbrella or other<br/>
&gt;shelter for the "stamping-up".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ahh now here is another area of Dartmoor folklore......What is the ideal<br/>
way to get boxes in the rain ?...ohh there are inflated plastic bag<br/>
thingys you can put box stamp and collectors book inside then inflate it<br/>
all up...so you can then stamp away using the techniques that they use to<br/>
handle dangerous chemicals with long gloved "hands"<br/>
<br/>
....even tent like rain cagoules made extra large for boxers to sit in and<br/>
stamp away in the ..er "dry" (sic)...<br/>
<br/>
But its usually also windy and that puts paid to a flapping cagoule...<br/>
<br/>
So then yes those big deep clear brollies are favoured and even dark room<br/>
type bags where you pop your hands in the ends to change film in a<br/>
camera..only you sort of stamp away inside..very curious...lots of<br/>
techniques .. I wonder if you have any personal favourites....there are<br/>
lots of ways...though taking it home to stamp in the dry is not favoured !<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
been there done that too  ...<lol><br/>

&gt;minutes before one had decided to quit.<br/>
<br/>
ohh yes ...such joy... you aren't a true Letterboxers if you give<br/>
in.....just because of a "spot" of rain <chuckle><br/>
<br/>
Well done Erik and daughter...a lovely tale...and one I can very<br/>
definitely associate with !<br/>
<br/>
.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is nuts! But, really fun.<br/>
<br/>
yep ! <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes to all boxers "in peril" in the rain !...<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like the title for a stirring boxers hymn to me ! <g><br/>

Graham! I'm extremely disappointed! My own personal dream of<br/>
Dartmoor is of the sun always shining and rainbows and temperatures<br/>
averaging 75 and an open pub always around the corner. <br/>
Oh well.... my daughters and I were going around singing from the<br/>
musical "Oliver" the other day ~ I think the school choir is singing<br/>
one of the songs this semester (was the movie made here or there?)...<br/>
there's that song that goes... "and the grass is green and dense, on<br/>
the right side of the fence..." :-}<br/>
