&gt; Help!  I'm a basic computer user and just getting into <br/>
letterboxing.  When I first went to the map site for downeast Maine <br/>
there were a number of letterboxes listed. In fact I printed  the <br/>
Cadillac Mountain Letterbox Info. But now I cannot get back to that <br/>
page nor can I fing the others letterboxes that I saw listed for that <br/>
area.  Does anyone know if these letterboxes have been removed?  Can <br/>
someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong?               Thank <br/>
