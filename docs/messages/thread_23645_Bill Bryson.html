England. In a Sunburned Country <br/>
&gt; is one of my favorites.<br/>
<br/>
Yep, Bryson's voice, which has that interesting combo accent and <br/>
drips with irony and sarcasm, is one of the best reasons to get the <br/>
audio. I also like In a Sunburned Country. (It's about a trip to <br/>
Australia.)<br/>
<br/>
Bryson's stuff is so good because he really does walk and hike <br/>
everywhere. So there's lots of tales of the trail.<br/>
<br/>
One warning: if you get his "A Short History of Everything" on <br/>
audio, do NOT get the unabridged version. That's not read by Bryson. <br/>
It's read by Richard Matthews, who has an uppercrust British accent. <br/>
Bryson's writing just doesn't sound the same in the other guy's <br/>
voice, although you know how it should sound!<br/>
<br/>
If you get the abridged version of the same book, Bryson reads it <br/>
himself. Much better, even if it is abridged. Also note that this is <br/>
not a travel and hiking book. It's straight non-fiction science <br/>
writing.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My uncle and I listened to A Walk in the Woods while he was driving me from <br/>
Sacramento to Santa Rosa, CA one day.  We'd both already read it, and he'd <br/>
listened to it many times before, but we were laughing so hard even though we <br/>
already knew what he was going to say.  I wish I could write like Bryson.<br/>
<br/>
I teach an evening class for adults at the high school where I work, and I've <br/>
been assigned to science this year.  There's no textbook, so I'm planning to <br/>
make some Power Points and use A Short History of Nearly Everything.  Because <br/>
it's fascinating.  :)<br/>
