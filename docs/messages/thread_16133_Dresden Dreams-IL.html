                    <div class="plaintext-content">If anyone is still interested, I'm almost positive this box was <br/>
removed due to its accidental placement on a frisbee golf <br/>
course. The course wasn't very well marked so it looked like a <br/>
regular park at the time, but when we went, we soon realized the <br/>
problem when we were walking on the fairway of someone's <br/>
game. Oops! Anyway it was already lost at that point and when I <br/>
told the placer, they decided not to replace the box. Just so ya <br/>
know.<br/>
