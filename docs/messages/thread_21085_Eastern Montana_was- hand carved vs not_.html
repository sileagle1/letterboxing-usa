&gt; &gt; Is Eastern Montana going to have some boxes when you leave there?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; Nope.  I don't know any boxers who might live in eastern Montana <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; contact them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We believe in keeping track of our boxes from a maintenance <br/>
&gt; standpoint.  If someone should contact us that one of our boxes is <br/>
&gt; possibly missing, or contact us to say that one of our boxes needs <br/>
&gt; any sort of first aid, we want to have the boxes placed close <br/>
enough <br/>
&gt; to be able to get out to it within a day or two. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
We believe in keeping up to date on our letterboxes also, but we do <br/>
plant letterboxes on our trips. Four were planted in southern <br/>
Montana and one (the best location of course) has gone missing. We <br/>
pulled the clues on that one, and the others remain viable. If an <br/>
area has little or no letterboxes a plant or two can give something <br/>
to an area and seed it. This gives a new letterboxer something to <br/>
find in that area, and something for those passing through. With <br/>
the "Contact the Placer" function, we get reports on most of our <br/>
letterboxes , and can keep them up to date.The only problem is that <br/>
if it goes missing you have to pull the clues. Since there were no <br/>
boxes in the area we planted ,without our letterboxes I'm not sure <br/>
if MT walker would have gotten hooked into letterboxing, and that <br/>
would be a loss for the game. Where do you have your letterboxes in <br/>
eastern Montana listed? I couldn't find them on LBNA.<br/>

We don't have any boxes in eastern Montana.  I was merely explaining why we <br/>
don't have.  For people that place boxes while they're on vacation in a <br/>
particular area, that's great, that's what works for them.  It doesn't work for Keith <br/>
&amp; I however, so we don't do it.  We only place boxes either where we're <br/>
living at the moment, or in places we visit where local boxers have been willing to <br/>
adopt the boxes and maintain them.  That's just what works best for us.<br/>
<br/>
But by far the majority of our boxes have never been listed on the website.  <br/>

Just curious, how would a letterboxer know how or where to ask for <br/>
clues? and in what area? We have some WOM clues also but post so <br/>
many, most folks know the areas we plant in.<br/>
As far as the finding aspect, do you only look for letterboxes in <br/>
the same manner,and not look for the letterboxes that are posted?<br/>

The manner of word of mouth depends on the letterbox.  For some of them, we <br/>
have posted the areas they're at on the letterboxing.org website with a note <br/>
for folks to contact us if they qualify.  Others, we give out to people as we <br/>
happen to meet them "in real life."   Keith &amp; I box at some very crazy hours in <br/>
some very crazy weather, so we figure if other folks are out there too and <br/>
come across us, they should get some clues to some extra boxes. :-)  And some of <br/>
the boxes, we give the clues out to friends who come into town from other <br/>
areas who are looking to do some boxing.  <br/>
<br/>
No, we have no problem with looking for letterboxes that have posted clues, <br/>
because we ourselves have placed plenty of letterboxes in our area with posted <br/>
clues for others to find at the website.  If you do a search at <br/>
letterboxing.org under my trail name (Pippi), you'll see the type of variety of boxes we <br/>
like to place.<br/>
<br/>
Since coming to this area this past summer, we've placed a total of 24 boxes <br/>
that have been posted on letterboxing.org.  6 of them were Limited Engagement <br/>
boxes, only meant to be in place for 3 or 4 weeks.  Two of those, the <br/>
Thanksgiving 2004 boxes, were word-of-mouth boxes as far as receiving the clues.  The <br/>
Scarecrow Festival 2004 boxes had the clues posted and the Christmas 2004 <br/>
boxes currently have the clues posted. <br/>
<br/>
Of the other 18 placed, one at the site right now is a word-of-mouth box.  And<br/>
 two (the two we placed this morning), require a question to be answered <br/>
about the local history of the area where the boxes are hidden in order to receive <br/>
the clues. <br/>
<br/>
But by doing a "search for boxes" at the site and then scrolling down to <br/>
Pippi in "pick a placer", it's not at all difficult to see what area we're in.   <br/>
