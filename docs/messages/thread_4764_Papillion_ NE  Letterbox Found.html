<div>On the 23rd of March, the Papillion letter box left by Funhog on his trip to witness the annual Migration of the cranes through Nebraska was found by Erich and his dog Merlin. Funhog I would like to thank you for placing a box here. I have driven past the area many times, but never took an opportunity to stop. Thank you for the reason that I needed. The view is quite beautiful and while I was stamping in I could geese migrating north over my head. Again, I Thank you and Merlin Thanks you.<br/><br/>Happy Boxing, </div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Erich, Doesn't it always take someone from out of town to get us to go <br/>
see what's in our own back yard? I whipped out the Papillion stamp <br/>
while eating a Krispy Kreme doughnut in Omaha. I don't think it's my <br/>
most fabulous effort but I had a little spare time and thought I would <br/>
do my best to leave one close to home for the Omaha contingent (of <br/>
two.) I hope you and the Magic Canine get to venture out and find some <br/>
of the others I placed a little farther afield. Actually, I'm not sure <br/>
if dogs are allowed at Spring Creek. (I'd call ahead- 402 797 2301.) <br/>
Wave to the geese for me. Funhog <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Isn't it always the way. You need someone from out of town to get you <br/>
to see the local sights. Glad you and the Magic Canine had a <br/>
successful outing. I made the stamp while eating a Krispy Kreme <br/>
doughnut in Omaha and I fear it isn't my finest effort. I just <br/>
couldn't leave the Omaha area without leaving a stamp behind. <br/>
Hopefully, you will get to venture farther afield and log into some of <br/>
my other boxes, especially the one in Denton. If you ever get out <br/>
Papilliion way again, would you mind adding another plastic bag around <br/>
the guestbook? I only had one with me at the time. Keep on boxing<br/>
