                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>The Coventry Grammar Nature Trail box is definitely missing. A young local boy who lived next door saw us drive into the parking lot, and tagged along with us to the box. We found the spot, but no box. Our new friend comfirmed that we had the right spot, and informed us that this is not the first time the box has gone missing. He also told us that he'd let the folks at the school know, so it might be replaced at some point in the near future. But, until then, this box is MIA.
