Location: Coralville Lake<br/>
Nearest Town: North Liberty, IA<br/>
County: Johnson<br/>
<br/>
Turkey Creek is a recreation area located in Coralville Lake. It is <br/>
located just past the Coralville Dam.  While driving through North <br/>
Liberty there are signs pointing you to the dam, and also Turkey <br/>
Creek.    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
You might want to bring a frisbee.  Play a round of disc golf.  From <br/>
the pad of the seventh hole, there is a path that runs through the <br/>
woods.  Halfway down this short path is a bridge.  From the bridge on <br/>
one side there is a large fallen tree.  The letterbox is underneath <br/>
this log.  Be careful when retrieving and replacing this box, as this <br/>
is a popular place to play disc golf.<br/>
<br/>
A shortcut to the 17th:  Drive your car to the last shelter.  The <br/>
17th hole's pad is nearby.<br/>
