Calibrating one's pace to feet or meters is a technique used in <br/>
Orienteering all the time.  All distances in Orienteering are given <br/>
in true distances (feet, meters, miles etc. rather than in steps or <br/>
paces )  According to them, (the orienteer-ers) a pace is indeed <br/>
counted when the same foot hits the ground.  ie  right foot to right <br/>
foot.  The secret is to measure your pace over a long distance.  <br/>
For instance, if you take a long tape measure and then measure <br/>
100' on the ground and then walk it several times to get an <br/>
average this will still not be as accurate as if you had gone <br/>
around a track.  We tend to not walk normally when we know we <br/>
are counting them!  Going around a track is a long enough <br/>
distance that we tend to fall into our regular rhythm and thus get <br/>
a more accurate measurement.  I was taught to do this a long <br/>
time ago. There was a small group of folks who wanted to start <br/>
an orienteering club.  They had a lot of great ideas.  One of those <br/>
was to use a clothespin.  Clip it on a bush or tree or whatever <br/>
and then give directions to it.  400' @ 210 ,  235' @ 90 for <br/>
example.  This will definitely teach you to pay attention to how you <br/>
hold a compass!  1 over 100 feet is a long way off!  (BTW this <br/>
little game is almost as much fun as letterboxing, seriously!)<br/>
  In spite of all this, I still count my steps rather than my paces.  <br/>
My paces do not divide evenly into 100'  and the steps do.  I also <br/>
tend to forget to count when pacing and have to go back and start <br/>
all over.  This is not such a big deal over 100'  but it is a real trial <br/>
when working with larger distances.  I think you will find that <br/>
being able to estimate distances by walking them is a fairly <br/>
useful skill.  You can become very accurate with only a very little <br/>
practice.  There are several good books on orienteering and <br/>
compass work out there.  Seems to me one title was "Be an <br/>
expert with map and compass"  Kjellstrom.  But don't quote me.  <br/>
Also, be aware that reading about using a compass is deadly <br/>
dull,  using a compass is exciting and fun!  <br/>
     Ok, so that was probably way more than anyone wanted to <br/>
know on the subject.  Still, being able to use a compass and <br/>
map is a skill that anyone spending a lot of time in wilderness <br/>
areas should know.  Even more worthwhile is to learn some <br/>
aidless navigation.  ie telling direction from sun position, stars, <br/>
etc.  <br/>
Enough.  sorry to ramble. :-)<br/>

While we usually give "steps" (count each footfall) in our clues, we <br/>
often forget to use calibration legs that help people gauge how far <br/>
our steps are compared to their own. But I love your allusion to the <br/>
zen of finding your way in the outdoors. Orienteers in particular <br/>
seem to have a knack for flowing with the countryside, kind of like <br/>
birds in migration. Plus they have those cool little thumby-compasses.<br/>
<br/>
I had a chance two summers ago to play army at Fort Sam Houston in <br/>
Texas and we did some "land navigation" that was a blast. The army is <br/>
very rigid about those things, using detailed topo maps and putting <br/>
everything into a grid so they don't drop bombs on each other. We had <br/>
to navigate, under fire, across several miles of Texas hill country, <br/>
eluding opposing forces, to find a helicopter crash site and rescue <br/>
the crew. It was letterboxing-like in it's fun factor, and the <br/>
camoflauge face paint was just a bonus. <br/>
<br/>
We did the whole army-style compass/grid/pacing thing, but since none <br/>
of us were really army and were just play-soldiers, we also used the <br/>
sun, wind, and noise from a huge generator a mile away to find our <br/>
way. Listening to the noise source move from right to left as we <br/>
travelled across the terrain really gave me an appreciation <br/>
for "transfering" mentally from the map graphic to the path ahead. We <br/>
only got ambushed once, and we were lucky enough to find the helo <br/>
crew. They were big guys and carrying them out turned into a <br/>
whole 'nother challenge.<br/>

a "pace")<br/>
