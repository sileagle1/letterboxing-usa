Milwaukee Lakefront, Southeastern Wisconsin<br/>

Terrain: Easy, but some long walks.<br/>
Difficulty: Just a lot of numbers.<br/>

Don't be intimidated. This is actually two letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
Start at Milwaukee's new addition to the Art Museum designed by Calatrava.<br/>
Marvel at the engineering of the footbridge suspended over the road by how<br/>
many cables?<br/>
<br/>
Move north to the open terrace of the old Art Museum/War Memorial where you<br/>
can admire the Calatrava's lakeside facade. Then from the center of the<br/>
terrace, look north (20 degrees Magnetic) and travel to the three brown<br/>
marble columns at the south end of the lagoon.<br/>
<br/>
Subtract the number of columns from the number of marble benches, then add<br/>
the number of short marble posts that surround you to arrive at "the<br/>
monument number".<br/>
<br/>
Locate the flag poles nearby at the intersection of five paths. Enjoy a long<br/>
walk along the lake to the farthest point of land east (3/4 mile). Wait<br/>
until you're alone, then beneath Green One, find a bonus letterbox hidden<br/>
behind a clever false back. Replace it and the camouflage carefully.<br/>
<br/>
Add the number of cables supporting Calatrava's footbridge to the number of<br/>
flag poles at "Five Paths". From Green One, take that number of steps north<br/>
along the breakwall and find the number in the red circle. (Careful, don't<br/>
fall in.)<br/>
<br/>
Return to the Vietnam Monument. To pass the time during the walk, multiply<br/>
"the monument number" by the square of the "red circle number". This is your<br/>
bearing. Now stand between the three tall columns and follow your bearing to<br/>
a giant maple tree (14 feet in circumference). PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO<br/>
BE RUN OVER. IT'S A BUSY STREET.<br/>
