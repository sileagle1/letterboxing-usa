it was in an area that would not be inundated by poison ivy but I was <br/>
wrong!  I had planned on hiding it better but I think that the <br/>
surrounding foliage will deter all but the avid seeker.  It is still <br/>
possible for you to get it without getting slimed but only if you are <br/>
very careful.  I would recommend long pants.  I will try and update <br/>
the clues accordingly but won't get to it for a week or so.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, it's a very lonely letterbox.  Only I seem to visit it.<br/>

Trish in "another weekend of rain!"  RI :(<br/>
