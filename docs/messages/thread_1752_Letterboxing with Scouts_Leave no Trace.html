                    <div class="plaintext-content">While a letterbox is indeed not biodegradable, it's direct impact is <br/>
minimal because it is maintained, and not a threat to the wildlife <br/>
because it's parts are [hopefully] not eaten and choked on by <br/>
animals. (Another reason not to leave dog treats).<br/>
<br/>
It is true that some areas are more sensetive to impact from <br/>
hikers going off-trail than others. I think everyone should, as part <br/>
of a basic outdoor education, learn how to minimize impact, learn <br/>
about endangered plant species in your area, etc.  We had a video on <br/>
the subject as part of our leader training in GS...but the name of it <br/>
doesn't come right to mind.<br/>

more inclusive attitute: Girl Scouting is for ALL girls.)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As an Eagle Scout, I thought I should put my 0.02 in about<br/>
Leave no Trace (LNT).  Clearly what everyone has stated here is <br/>
true (especially the BSA being homophobic and militaristic.)<br/>
<br/>
I think, as Jay has pointed out, this is a real need for some sort of<br/>
statement in the FAQ about our colective stance on LNT, alpine zones, food<br/>
in boxes.  Not only do observing these these ideals promote saving what<br/>
little is left of the wilderness, it is quite likely that alot of<br/>
letterboxers are not familiar with these principles. As I am sure, some<br/>
have been hiking for years and found letterboxing, and others first found<br/>
letterboxing and are now hiking everyday.<br/>
<br/>
As for not being able to place letterboxing into the Boy Scout<br/>
program...  I am sure that the Assistant Scout Masters can think of many<br/>
ways to include this in the program.  This definately applies most<br/>
directly to the orienteering, hiking, MB.<br/>
