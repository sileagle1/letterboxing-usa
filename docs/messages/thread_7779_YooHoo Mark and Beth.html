                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, sorry about that Funhog.  Our hard drive crashed last Thursday, <br/>
and prior to that by 1.5 weeks Verizon's tech support messed up my <br/>
request to add Beth and deleted my email address instead.  After <br/>
talking to 12 people, I "finally" got to a manager who said he <br/>
submitted the problem to programming and they will be taking another <br/>
15 or 25 days to fix it.  Following this promised coming fix and my <br/>
letter to their CEO regarding their blantant lack of customer support <br/>
replaced with a "who give's a damn attitude", I plan to drop them.  <br/>
If you look online there are tons of other such complaints and the <br/>
really pathetic part of it all, is many say the tech told them they <br/>
would call the customer back but never did.  The guy I talked to said <br/>
they were not permitted to make calls back to any customer.  A rather <br/>
unproductive company rule that has apparantly been in place for some <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
So, for now please use my hotmail addy and whatever you do, DON'T go <br/>
with VERIZON as your ISP if you are expecting any sort of support <br/>
when you need it most.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any other ISP recommendations for DSL in the Portland, <br/>
Oregon area I'm all ears.  <br/>
