                    <div class="plaintext-content">We went hiking today in Vernon Connecticut.  The first hike was the<br/>
Rockville spur rail to trails that got us warmed up for the next two. We<br/>
did the Tortoise and the Hare that brook is so beautiful. My son who is<br/>
6 just loved jumping over the brook and trying to find a place he could<br/>
cross back over.  And the Brail trail has alot of history about Valley<br/>
Falls that was great.. We also did the Little Bird on a Branch which has<br/>
a really great place for trout fishing. The brook is so nice that I want<br/>
to come back and walk it in the summer time.  We also invited 3 family<br/>
members to come with us letterboxing and I think there hooked. So maybe<br/>
there are three more letterboxers to add to are gang.<br/>
What a great day in Vernon Ct.<br/>
