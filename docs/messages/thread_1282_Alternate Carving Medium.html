In reading through the list I noticed you are interested in finding <br/>
another carving medium -- I own small art rubber stamp store in<br/>
Essex, CT - don't know if that's too far for you to travel - but I am <br/>
now carrying 3 sizes of Staedler Carving Blocks (Marscarve) as I am<br/>
trying to promote Lbing to my customer base via my newsletters. One <br/>
size is 4x6 so you could get 3 2x4 stamps from one block. I have not <br/>
done a lot of carving yet but in my estimation this is not at all <br/>
crumbly,is very easy to work with and makes a wonderful impression. I <br/>
offer mail order as part of my business services. <br/>

Being a Stamp Professional I hope you can answer this question. <br/>
<br/>
What rubber material is used in laser cutting stamps? I have a laser <br/>
engraver at work which I used to carve the red material that came <br/>
with my Speed Cut started kit. It worked pretty good, but have not <br/>
found that 4x6" block sold by itself.<br/>
<br/>
Erasers really stunk up the lab when I cut my "Locust Shade" stamp...<br/>
<br/>
I really like hand carving the erasers, but I also enjoy the <br/>
challenge of graphic design on the computer which can then be turned <br/>
into a stamp.  Tom Cooch mentioned he found a place that he can send <br/>
graphic files which the company then produces a laser cut stamp for <br/>
about $10 each....<br/>
