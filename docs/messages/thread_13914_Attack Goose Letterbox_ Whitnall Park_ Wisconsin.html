Unfortunatly, after a very short 2 weeks, the Attack Goose Letterbox<br/>
at Whitnall Park has disappeared.  Since the other two boxes (Wehr<br/>
Nature Center and Boerner Botanical Garden) in the park have also<br/>
disappeared within the last few months, I'm wondering if it isn't<br/>
someone with the park removing them.  A little notice through email<br/>
would be appreciated if that's the case...sure would save a lot of<br/>
time and effort on the part of placer and finders....oh well.  Any<br/>
info would be appreciated.  At this point it's doubtful that the box<br/>
will be replaced.<br/>
