                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I discovered that the legendary Funhog had planted a letterbox <br/>
in Newbury Park, only a one-hour drive north of Pasadena, I was off <br/>
to find it the next Saturday.  Since the LB had only been planted a <br/>
couple of weeks earlier, and since it involved a 5 mile hike, which I <br/>
thought would scare off some letterboxers, I even had high hopes of <br/>
being the "First Stamp" in a Funhog Box!  <br/>
<br/>
The hike was beautiful.  I'd heard about this area before, because <br/>
Ryan has planted a couple of letterboxes in this range, and I'd <br/>
always planned to take a trip up here to find these.  I found <br/>
Funhog's letterbox, and was the first actual stamp; however, <br/>
unfortunately, I was preceded by geocachers.  The geocachers found <br/>
the letterbox on 5/27/04, took the stamp as a trade item, and <br/>
replaced it with a little toy.  I saw from the stamp book image that <br/>
the Phoebe's Cabin stamp was beautiful too (heavy sigh).<br/>
<br/>
These geocachers signed their names, and I wondered if anyone can <br/>
tell me the best way to try and contact them.  I took the toy they <br/>
left in Phoebe's Cabin and would be happy to exchange it with them <br/>
for the Funhog stamp, which I'd then replace in the letterbox.  I've <br/>
gone to the main Geocaching site, but haven't figured out yet how to <br/>
contact a geocacher through it.  Can anyone tell me the best way to <br/>
contact geocachers?  <br/>
<br/>
P.S. I left a Hitchhiker in Phoebe's Cabin, so at least the next <br/>
finder will get a stamp after that hike.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I used to wonder why some boxers write "NOT A GEOCACHE" on their boxes in big <br/>
black letters, but this is exactly why.<br/>
<br/>
Here's my best guess.   If they were caching in the area, there must be a <br/>
geocache near there.   Find it, or some nearby, look in the log entries for the <br/>
caches and see if their names are entered.   From there, you can (if you're a <br/>
member and are logged in) click on their name and there'll be a link on their <br/>
profile page to email them.<br/>
<br/>
As I recall, it was easy to sign up on the site, so you might want to <br/>
register yourself, so you can do that, or else sweet talk someone who's a member to <br/>
forward a message for you.   <g><br/>

You could try going to the "advanced search" link on the main page and <br/>
"search by username" to find caches they've either found or hidden.   That would <br/>
also get you to the link to their profile page.<br/>
<br/>
DebBee, shutting up now, I hope<br/>
