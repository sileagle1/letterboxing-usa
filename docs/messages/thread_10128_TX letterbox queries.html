I'm very happy to hear that boxers have found the Green Belt and Mt.<br/>
Bonnell boxes in good shape. (Thanks to all for sealing the ziplocks<br/>
well. These boxes get soaked, flooded, drenched!) Funhog, please stamp<br/>
in, too! You sent us to beautiful areas in Colorado this summer<br/>
(Dinosaur ridge and Arapaho National Forest) but after much searching<br/>
boxes were not to be found, alas. Family bet has it that you own a<br/>
harley (a hog!). True?<br/>
Happy TX letterboxing and looking forward to finding the two Six Flags<br/>
over TX series! Great idea!<br/>

Box is still where it is supposed to be.  I think I decoded the clues <br/>
correctly but did not see the box under the rock anywhere when I was <br/>
in Austin back in December.  I will be coming back to Austin in a few <br/>
weeks and will give it another try if you say it is still there.<br/>
