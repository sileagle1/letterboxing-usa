To: <webmasters@letterboxing.org><br/>
<br/>
Hello,<br/>
<br/>
   I am a horticulturist at the Sarah P. Duke Gardens in Durham, NC.<br/>
This Fall I became aware that a letterbox had been placed in the native<br/>
plant collection of which I am curator. Initially I felt that it's presence<br/>
there was fairly innocuous, as I rarely saw anyone visiting it. Recently<br/>
however, I have become concerned about the number of visitors to the<br/>
letterbox and the plants they are trampling to reach it. I have therefore<br/>
removed the box from the garden. I have it in my office where it can be<br/>
retrieved by the person who placed it there. It cannot be placed there<br/>
again, however. A botanic garden is not a wise place to locate one of these<br/>
things that attract people who, by and large have little interest in<br/>
anything but finding the box. Gardens such as ours play host to rare and<br/>
endangered species of plants, and I would hate to think that anyone would<br/>
think that finding a letterbox would be more important than protecting plant<br/>
species that are rapidly disappearing due to other kinds of human<br/>
encroachment. Please, let's try to keep letterboxes out of places like<br/>
botanic gardens. I would appreciate it if you would inform others that this<br/>
letterbox is no longer in place.<br/>
<br/>
                                     Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
                                         Stefan Bloodworth<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's funny how people can read the same message and get a different take on <br/>
it.  I thought the horticulturalist's e-mail was calm, thoughtful and <br/>
diplomatic--especially considering that some of the Garden's plants had apparently been <br/>
disturbed.  While I think that most people who indulge in our odd little <br/>
hobby have a greater than usual appreciation of the natural world, it's true that <br/>
it would only take one or two overanxious seekers to trample sensitive plants <br/>
and make letterboxing look incompatable with true appreciation of the place.<br/>
<br/>
Who knows--maybe the placer can work something out with Mr. Bloodworth to <br/>
leave the box in a better place in the Garden that is less liable to <br/>
misinterpretation (or washout) and inadvertent distruction.  If not, I agree with him that <br/>
it's best to respectfully leave the place boxless--and also to heed his <br/>
concerns when considering placing a box in any other botanical garden.<br/>
