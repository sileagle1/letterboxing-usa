someone else's.  Sometimes they get taken as trade goods, but not <br/>
always.<br/>
<br/>
I have a geocaching travel bug which is a letterbox, and which <br/>
recently made it into the center of letterboxing territory in New <br/>
England.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a geocache which you can only find if you go to a letterbox <br/>
first to get the coordinates.  <br/>
<br/>
It is fun to think of ways to get the two sports intermingled.  <br/>
<br/>
As for co-habitation, lets have none of that unless there is a <br/>
prenuptual agreement... ;)<br/>
