et. al, I haven't forgotten about letterboxing...I's just that, well...I<br/>
thought I was busy before with the wedding stuff...I guess I didn't know<br/>
what I was talking about.<br/>
So, I see that my first letterbox clue (Mt. Neahkahnie) has been posted!<br/>
Yay! It's exciting to see it on the net.  But, it's got a totally different<br/>
format than any I've ever seen, and the image of my stamp is gigantic. <br/>
I'm so impressed with the dedication and creativity of you all out there.  I<br/>
have gone out with letterboxes in hand, and find that I have an nearly<br/>
impossible time coming up with creative clues! But I have found some lovely<br/>
spots to hide them.  That is a skill that will improve, I guess, as my P<br/>
quotient goes up.<br/>

saw an interesting license plate frame at Costco last night.  Seriously<br/>
debated hanging out in the parking lot to ask about it...<br/>

<br/>
I find myself looking for likely spots anytime I am out roaming around<br/>
any semi-rural area.  My recent experiences with Rock Creek #1 (lost and<br/>
found and lost and found again), have left me a little skittish about<br/>
placing anymore boxes in town.. although, I might get over that.<br/>
<br/>
good luck with that P quotient!<br/>
