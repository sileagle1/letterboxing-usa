That's right! Forget about your holiday countdown… there are<br/>
only 1000 days left until the next "We Live and Breathe<br/>
Letterboxing" celebration!<br/>
<br/>
I realize that's almost three years away, but planning is actually<br/>
already underway! Believe me, if the next one is going to even come<br/>
close to matching the fun of the first Live and Breathe retreat, then<br/>
it's definitely not too early to start getting organized.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this time around, we will be celebrating fifteen years of<br/>
American letterboxing. Nothing is carved in stone, yet, but the plan is<br/>
to have this one on the east coast… probably in New England.<br/>
We're looking at several residence camps in the Massachusetts/New<br/>
Hampshire area, and we've set a tentative event date for Labor Day<br/>
weekend, 2013. That would be from Friday, August 30, through Monday,<br/>
September 2.<br/>
<br/>
As our plans become more certain, we will post updates on the official<br/>
event website at www.weliveandbreathe.com<br/>
<http: www.weliveandbreathe.com=""> , so stay tuned.<br/>
