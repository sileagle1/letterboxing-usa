Out of curiosity, I went to check on the Massie's Creek boxes<br/>
yesterday. #2 is in fine shape, right where it should be.<br/>
<br/>
However, #1 is gone as far as I can tell. When they closed the<br/>
covered bridge, their intention was to build a new bridge. They've<br/>
dug out the area where #1 was hidden. I have no idea if the box was<br/>
found and returned to Flyfisher, or if it's somewhere in the huge<br/>
mound of dirt piled up there now.<br/>
<br/>
So much for replacing the book. I'm just glad I didn't decide to put<br/>
the hitchhiker in that one!<br/>
<br/>
