Letterbox:  The Great Island (Wellfleet, Ma.), placed Nov. 9, 2003.<br/>
      Driving directions to Great Island Trail:<br/>
   From Rte. 6, follow green signs to Wellfleet Center. Turn left <br/>
onto Commercial St. (follow signs to town marina). Continue driving <br/>
along the shoreline, (passing the town pier), via Chequesset Neck Rd. <br/>
The Great Island parking lot will be on your left.  [The water view <br/>
will be on your left at all times after leaving Rte. 6.]<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  The trail begins on the side of the parking lot opposite the <br/>
picnic area.  Follow the crushed stone path downhill, past a Great <br/>
Island Trail sign.  At the bottom is a large sign stating:<br/>
 Smith Tavern (1.8. miles)<br/>
 Great Beach Hill (2.9 miles)<br/>
 Jeremy Point (4.1 miles)<br/>
The letterbox is approximately 2 miles from this spot. Follow the <br/>
path around an inlet referred to as "the Gut".  Walking can be <br/>
somewhat slow, as the path is mostly soft sand.<br/>
  Take a right at another larger sign pointing the way to Great Beach <br/>
Hill and Jeremy Point Lookout. You are now strolling through pitch <br/>
pine and oak woods.  In about 10 minutes you'll pass by a small sign <br/>
on the left pointing the way to the Great Island Tavern site.  On the <br/>
right is another large trail sign.<br/>
  Approximately 5 minutes later you'll reach a memorial stone.  It's <br/>
on the left and clearly visible from the path.  The stone is slightly <br/>
over 6 feet tall.  People have turned it into a cairn by topping it <br/>
with beach stones and shells. It is inscribed with an inspiring quote <br/>
by Governor William Bradford of the Mayflower. <br/>
  Stand next to the left side of the stone facing the woods.  Walk 8 <br/>
paces (left foot count only) to 2 pine trees, side by side, that form <br/>
a vee. With your back still to the stone, stand at the vee and look <br/>
straight ahead.  <br/>
  You'll spy 2 upright dead trees.  Follow the small path to the left <br/>
of the vee to reach these trees.  Stand facing them, then turn your <br/>
head to the right.  Tucked under a low pine that you can almost reach <br/>
out and touch is The Great Island L.B. It is covered with bark.  <br/>
Please rehide carefully after stamping in. <br/>
  You may retrace your steps or continue on to a secluded beach <br/>
backed by dunes. This place is a favorite peaceful retreat for us.<br/>
