&amp; immensely happy.  Alaska is everything I thought it would be and<br/>
more...<br/>
<br/>
First the letterboxing news...  my brother-in-law and I hunted and found<br/>
Skyline #1... the easiest of that series of 5 stamps.  We also looked<br/>
for #2, but after about an hour of scrounging in the detris, we came<br/>
away empty-handed.  We were expected for dinner, so we had to abandon<br/>
our search then and there... but I did come away with the one stamp &amp;<br/>
passed my printed clues along to an orienteering guy I met.  We were<br/>
very close to the other Kenai stamp series, but our schedule was just so<br/>
packed it was not possible to allocate anymore time.... next year I'll<br/>
take 10 days &amp; devote one to l-boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Advice on hunting Kenai boxes... the Skyline trail gets fairly steep... <br/>
good shoes/boots are in order.  Also, the disclaimer about bear &amp; moose<br/>
is accurate.  Didn't see any bear, but we did spot 8 moose in the<br/>
vicinty.  Moose have a nasty tendency to run TOWARD you... so be nice &amp;<br/>
be safe.  Also.... mosquito repellent is a MUST.... these critters will<br/>
haul you off to their nest to feed their young.  They are big and<br/>
voracious.<br/>
<br/>
Other highlights of my trip...  fished with friends of my bro-in-law. <br/>
They are commercial fishers who use small set nets.  Matt has permits<br/>
for 9.  They pull nets 4 times a day... always at slack tide, otherwise<br/>
it would be even more dangerous.  We caught mostly sockeye salmon and a<br/>
very few King salmon, the largest weighing in at over 70 pounds.  These<br/>
people live on the beach in pretty primitive conditions.  We camped in a<br/>
tent, they have the luxury of a plywood cabin that leans badly.  A<br/>
tough, tough way to make a living.  I learned how to fillet salmon &amp;<br/>
between the three of us, we brought home over 80 lbs of filleted<br/>
salmon!!!  yum!!<br/>
<br/>
The other part of the trip was in the lap of luxury... an immaculately<br/>
maintained 1937 cabin on the shore of Kenai lake.  The owner (a<br/>
childhood friend of my bro-in-law) flew his floatplane down from<br/>
Anchorage to cook gourmet meals for us all weekend.  Too rough!!<br/>
<br/>
We saw many glaciers &amp; the wildlife list included the aforementioned<br/>
moose, Dall sheep, Mountian goats, orcas, sea otters, stellar sea lions,<br/>
myriad of waterfowl, bald AND golden eagles... and other stuff that will<br/>
haunt me for years.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to be home &amp; read that you have all been busy....  pictures will<br/>
follow....<br/>
