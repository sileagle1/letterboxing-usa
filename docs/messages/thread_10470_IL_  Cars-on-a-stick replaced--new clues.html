	This would be the most ordinary of dingy strip malls, were it <br/>
not for its owner, an artpatron named David Bermant.  Instead, thanks <br/>
to Bermant's passion for public art, the mall has<br/>
more than twenty pieces of sculpture towering over the parking lots <br/>
and lining the sidewalk in front of the stores.   Many of them move<br/>
some almost imperceptibly, some with the push of a<br/>
button, others with every breeze.  For a complete list of the art, <br/>
and the controversies that have sometimes surrounded it, see <br/>
http://www.enteract.com/~jdeubel/plaza/<br/>
	Undoubtedly, the best-known piece of art in the Cermak Plaza, <br/>
thanks both to its size and its cameo role in the movie "Wayne's <br/>
World," is an 80 foot tall spike that appears to have been<br/>
pushed through a stack of  eight cars in various stages of <br/>
disintegration.    The sculpture is officially named "Spindle" but at <br/>
our house we've always just called it "Cars-on-a-stick."  This<br/>
letterbox is placed in honor of this quirky piece of public art and <br/>
in the hopes that you'll stop awhile and appreciate this too often <br/>
neglected collection.  <br/>
Directions:<br/>
    The Cermak Plaza is located at the southeast corner of the <br/>
intersection of Harlem Avenue and Cermak Road in Berwyn, Illinois, <br/>
about eight miles from downtown Chicago.  Both the<br/>
Eisenhower expressway (I-290) and the Stevenson Expressway (I-55) <br/>
have Harlem Avenue exits (the mall is about two miles south of the <br/>
Eisenhower and about four miles north of the Stevenson). The mall can <br/>
also be reached by public transportation.     <br/>
	Once you've located the mall, start your search at the base <br/>
of the Cars-on-a-stick.  Note and remember the artist's nameyou'll <br/>
need it later.  Now look toward the horizon, facing the<br/>
same direction as the spindled car with the license plate KPA 807. As <br/>
you scan the horizon to your left you'll see a water tower, and then <br/>
just below and to the left of the water tower, you'll see a moving <br/>
sculpture that just sticks above a small square building.  That <br/>
sculpture is called "Bee Tree" by artist George Rhoads.<br/>
          You're going to go over by Bee Tree, but you'd be crazy to <br/>
just cut across the parking lot. Instead walk over to the strip mall <br/>
and walk along the sidewalk in front of the stores, admiring<br/>
the other sculptures on your way.  Now go to the Bee Tree.  Starting <br/>
from in front of Bee Tree, go around the square building until you <br/>
find another sculpture by the same artist who did the<br/>
cars-on-a-stick.  As you read the sign, notice that you are in an <br/>
extremely public spot.  Think of how very foolish it would be to put <br/>
a letterbox in the rear wheel well of that sculpture.  Someone<br/>
would surely take it.  So anticipate that the replacement box would <br/>
be in a much less public place.  Look across the parking lot to a <br/>
store that sends you around in circles (just as these clues<br/>
have done).  Near that store is a sculpture called Urban Towersfour <br/>
fifteen foot towers made out of discarded circuit boards (very <br/>
nondescript during the day, wonderfully illuminated from<br/>
within at night).  The towers stand in four of six small gardens.  <br/>
Find the easternmost garden without a tower.  Move the pieces of mud-<br/>
like stone to discover the letterbox in under a south-<br/>
and east facing ledge.  Please be sure to tuck the letterbox away <br/>
completely and discreetly when you are done.     <br/>
