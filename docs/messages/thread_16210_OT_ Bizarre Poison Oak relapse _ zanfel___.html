<br/>
Somehow, despite not letterboxing for several days (more like weeks) <br/>
and not having been anywhere remotely near any dreaded, evil &amp; <br/>
sadistic  poison oak for several months, I managed to get another <br/>
bout of it the past few days.  Long story short--but it recently <br/>
grew cool in the area and we started wearing jeans again--perhaps <br/>
there was residual poison oak oils in the jeans?  Regardless, I just <br/>
happened to have found that product 'Zanfel' a few weeks ago and it <br/>
claims to get rid of it right away.  I used it this morning and it <br/>
definitely got rid of the itch right away,still working on the <br/>
swelling.  I'm now a believer in the product--it's a bit expensive <br/>
but I'm so excited that it works I don't care about the price at the <br/>
moment!  For other sufferers out there, you probably totally <br/>
understand where I'm coming from.<br/>
<br/>
So, if anyone else out there has similar nuclear violent reactions <br/>
to poison oak, ivy &amp; sumac, this might also work for you.<br/>
<br/>
Zanfel--about $40 for a tube<br/>
I got mine at Rite Aid but it's also available at CVS and even <br/>
online at Zanfel's website.  <br/>
<br/>
I also saw another product that claimed to do the same thing for <br/>
about 1/3 the price--by the company that makes Tecnu and it comes <br/>
with a scrub/exfoliant cream and a clear soap/oil remover.  It may <br/>
work just as well--just haven't tried it yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this brings some relief to other letterboxing poison <br/>
oak/ivy/sumac sufferers out there!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You know, just today I hiked up Bishops Peak to check up on one of my <br/>
boxes (and so Princess Lea could find) and somebody--don't know who--<br/>
but somebody added some poison oak preventative wipes in the box.  I <br/>
thought that was hilarious, and perhaps a suggestion to me about <br/>
where I hide my boxes?  (But hey, there is poison oak EVERYWHERE out <br/>
here!  Bishops Peak isn't nearly as bad as most places!)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I should start including such items in more of my <br/>
letterboxes, though....  =)<br/>
