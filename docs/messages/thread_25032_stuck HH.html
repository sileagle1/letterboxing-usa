I completely agree. It is really cool to find a little surprise like HH's that most have given up as lost - both for the finder and the owner. Besides, letterboxing for me is supposed to be a non-competitive, enjoyable pasttime. My life is busy enough at all other times!<br/>

i would leave it. we live in an impatient world. while it is true that<br/>
hitchhikers should be moved along, who says they can't have a rest? i once<br/>
found a hitchhiker that had been sitting for 2 years. i felt like i had a<br/>
double bonus!<br/>

&gt; I moved a HH last year to a box that is very rarely found. I've<br/>
&gt; been pondering going back and getting the little HH and moving it<br/>
&gt; to a box that is found more frequently. It's been there over a year<br/>
&gt; now. Any thoughts?<br/>
