<br/>
35 years ago I read a juvenile book where the plot line consisted of <br/>
a young boy finding some clues that another young boy had written <br/>
years ago.  I do not remember how boy one found the clues - maybe <br/>
they were in an old book in the house.  <br/>
<br/>
The present day youngster worked hard trying to solve the puzzle, <br/>
even enlisting his parents in helping to solve the mystery.  The <br/>
book's conclusion (at this point I hope I am not spoiling a story you <br/>
are in the middle of !?!) involves the boy finding a tin burried in <br/>
the ground just inside a cave near his house at night.  <br/>
<br/>
As our yougster opens the box, finding other notes and trinkets <br/>
hidden 30 years before, the father steps out from behind a boulder <br/>
with a headress on, welcoming his son into the club he began when he <br/>
was himself just a boy growing up in the house with his parents.<br/>
<br/>
I fell in love with the idea of hiding a treasure the day I read that <br/>
book in 1966-67.  As a 12 year old, I got an old Christmas cookie tin <br/>
and tried to wrap up some notes in the plastic sheeting left over <br/>
from our greenhouse.  (This was in the days before sealing plastic <br/>
bags and tupperware containers existed - I think.)<br/>
<br/>
I think I hid the box in the gravel walk outside our house, but <br/>
nothing ever came of it.  I don't think I left it there.  I may have <br/>
showed it to someone, but never put any clues out that someone might <br/>
just stumble across.  I have some distant memory of going back later <br/>
and finding everything soaking wet.  (somethings never change)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have similar memories?  Anyone have any idea what book I <br/>
might be talking about??<br/>
