<br/>
<br/>Butterfly, Lobsta Lady, my friend Andy and I decided to stop at Wanda and Pete's for a visit :-)  After stamping into their house box, we went out cross country skiing at the Great Swamp WMA in Richmond/West Kingstown area (?).  There was just enough fluffy white snow to ski, so we ventured out onto the trails to find Moonstone Baby's new series "Dog Days of Summer," and the Holly Impromptu letterbox.  We had a blast out on the loop, and thank goodness Andy doesn't hate me for dragging him along, on borrowed skis no less!  He actually enjoyed his first letterboxing excursion and said that he would like to go letterboxing again.  I don't think he will be as "dedicated" as the rest of us, but that's ok.... another convert is a good thing!
<br/>
<br/>Unfortunately, due to the lack of sunlight (if we just had another hour of sunlight.... sigh) we were unable to get the Adventures of Tin Tin box at the Great Swamp, which means that we will definitely be back!  This was also Butterfly's first letterboxing excursion in RI, and since she totally enjoyed herself, I doubt it will be her last!
<br/>
<br/>This afternoon (Sunday), I stopped by my "local" box at the beach house, the Quonochantaug (I live here, and I STILL can't spell it!!!!) letterbox is alive and well with a new and wonderfully carved stamp by Jay Drew!!!!  Go now, before there are too many people at the breach way.  You don't want one of them calling the police department and complaining that you're wandering aimlessly through the brush..... right Warrior Woman?????  ;-)    (btw... I still get a big kick out of that story!  not that it was funny at the time.....!!!!  but I'm sure that Warrior Woman's laughing about it now!)
<br/>
<br/>Anyway, thanks Wanda, Pete, Lobsta Lady and Butterfly for a great weekend!  Hope to see you again soon!

oops, Music Woman, this great day in R.I. was my first time letterboxing
on skis, however I have had great fun letterboxing with Moonstone Baby  in
R.I. , buzzing around to many boxes. Then again a lovely time in Fisherbrook
with Trish. and in the pouring rain with Bluebird at the Mystery Gather.
I am looking to go back again, thats for sure.<br/>

<br/>
It was Lobsta Lady's first excursion into Rhode Island<br/>
Saturday, &amp; I'll be back for sure! And I was impressed<br/>
at Andy's dedication to you, to go out like that &amp;<br/>
have fun in spite of not knowing what he was getting<br/>
in for! I got cold just looking at him with no hat or<br/>
gloves &amp; getting wet in his cotton jeans when he fell<br/>
because he'd never xc skied before! I was Amazed he<br/>
didn't go into hypothermia once the sun got low! It<br/>
was Great fun &amp; thanks for the hot chocolate too! <br/>
We (Bluebird &amp; Butterfly)did get over to Alan's<br/>
anniversary box Sunday (You are one Amazingly Good<br/>
carver! and the box &amp; it's other contents were Very<br/>
Impressive!)after a fun, though occassionally<br/>
frustrating day of snow shoeing to letterboxes. We<br/>
found it to be Grim in Griswald &amp; Hopeless at Hope<br/>
Pond, but Really enjoyed Max's swimming hole (Great<br/>
stamp!)after Butterfly nosed out the box! (She is<br/>
Amazing!), and enjoyed Pete's cute kitty cat stamp<br/>
honoring Wanda's Great 2,000 boxes in 2 years<br/>
Accomplishment.  Looking forward to more Great<br/>
Adventures out on the trail soon. Enjoy!<br/>
