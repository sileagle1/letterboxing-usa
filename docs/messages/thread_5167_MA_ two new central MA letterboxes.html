and I replanted Pick o' Nick on 4/27/02 as I was unhappy with its original

<div align="left">Where:  Leominster State Forest, Westminster/Princeton, 
MA</div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left">Length: Plan on at least an hour for the hike adding another 
half an hour or so for a picnic at the top or base of the cliffs.</div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left">Trail difficulty: <em>Very</em> steep but short trail sections 
ascending and descending either side of the ledges.</div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left">Clue difficulty: Easy</div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left"><u>Getting There</u></div>
<div align="left">    From the North:</div>
<div align="left">        Take Route 2 to Route 31 
South. In 2 miles you will pass the main entrance to Leominster State 
Park on your left.  1000 ft. beyond this entrance is a gated paved 
parking lot on your left that is open in the spring and fall seasons and 
for swimming area overflow in the summer.  However, it is generally closed 
in the winter and summer.  If this lot is closed, continue for another 1000 
ft. to a gravel parking lot on your right used by rock climbers and hikers 
alike.</div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left">    From the South:</div>
<div align="left">        Take Route 190 to 140 
North.  At about 5 miles you will reach the junction of Routes 31 and 140 
which head north together for a mile or two.  Then Route 140 bears left at 
a flashing yellow light.  Bear right, continuing on Route 31 for about a 
mile where you will come to the gravel parking lot on your left.  The State 
Park lot is 1000 feet further on your right.</div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left"><strong>Trail and Clues from paved parking lot at State 
Park:</strong></div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left">        Walk straight across Route 
31 to the Crow Hill Trail marked with blue blazes.  Heading uphill, you 
will come to a fork.  The left branch directs  you to the Base of 
Ledges, the right branch leads to Top of Ledges.  Follow the trail to the 
base of the ledges.  Take in the beauty, the height and the vertical drop 
of the cliffs.  There is rarely a day that there is not at least one pair 
of rock climbers scaling these walls.  Be especially courteous on the trail 
here allowing for a wide girth between you and the climbers with their 
equipment.  Reaching the end of the ledges you will find two picnic tables 
and a trail to your left that goes to the gravel parking lot mentioned 
above.  But continue straight ahead <strong>[</strong>taking the Mid State 
Trail (marked with yellow blazes) in a SW direction.  Between a hand of 
three oaks and one  larger oak lie two boulders.  Walk 
between these boulders around to the far side of the boulder on your 
right.  The <em>Pick O' Nick Letterbox, </em>dedicated to our 
son, Nicholas, a Geology student, is nestled beneath an overhang of 
this rock.  </div>
<div align="left">        Now double back to the 
junction of the Crow Hill Trail.  Take a left, staying on the Mid State 
Trail and climbing the rocky path to the top of the ledges.  Enjoy the view 
from the many overlooks along the ridge.  An expansive rock outcrop offers 
an excellent picnicking spot with a sweeping view.  On a clear day you 
can make out the skyscrapers of Boston in the East.  Crow Hill Pond and 
Paradise Pond lie to your immediate East and South with Mount Wachusett to the 
Southwest.  You may be able to catch a tiny glimpse of the Wachusett 
Reservoir nestled between the hills farther South.  After you've had your 
fill of the view and whatever nosh you've brought along, continue along the 
trail.  At the next trail junction, take a left, staying on the Mid State 
Trail.  Almost immediately you will pass by a rock ledge wall about 7-10 
feet high on your left.  Continue on this well blazed portion of the 
trail.  Look for a large lichen covered rock on the right side of the 
trail.  Fifteen paces beyond this rock lies a fallen log pointing Southwest 
at 220 degrees.  Follow this log to its end.  Directly ahead you will 
find the <em>Boston Butterfly Letterbox </em>resting between two tree 
trunks.  This box is dedicated to our daughter, Vanessa, who has fluttered 
off to Boston to live and learn.</div>
<div align="left">        Again, double back to the 
trail junction.  Take a left, leaving the Mid State Trail.  The blue 
blazed trail will take you through a steep descent which includes 14 stone steps 
to the base of the ledges.  You will reach the fork that you encountered 
near the start of your journey, thus having made a loop around the 
cliffs.<strong>]  </strong>Bear to the left, continuing downhill to the 
parking lot at the State Park.</div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left"><strong>Trail and Clues from gravel parking lot:</strong></div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left">        From the parking lot 
follow the blue blazed trail to the Crow Hill ledges.  At the two picnic 
tables and base of the ledges is the junction of the Mid State Trail.  Take 
a left and follow directions in <strong>[ ] </strong>above.  When you 
reach the fork where signs mark the Trail to Base of Ledges and Trail to Top of 
Ledges, take a right following along the base of the ledges.  Once past the 
ledges, take a left at the picnic tables, returning to the gravel parking 
lot.</div>
