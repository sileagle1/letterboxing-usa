about finding a LB with no stamp but trinkets were left in the box.<br/>
Boy oh boy, the harshest critics seemed to be those that don't even<br/>
know what LBing is. But it was nice to see that further down in the<br/>
comments, voices of reason joined in.<br/>
<br/>
I want to share what I do when hiding an LB, on the flip side of the<br/>
stamp I write my trail name, email address and a note that says, "Do<br/>
not remove. Leave with letterbox" with a sharpie pen. I've had 2 LBs<br/>
taken (I've hidden 8)the whole box not just the stamp was taken and<br/>
I'm pretty sure kids took them, not LBers or geocachers, but at least<br/>
if their mom or friends see the flip side of the stamp they'll know it<br/>
was stolen. Since losing the first LB I've started keeping a copy of<br/>
the image so I can re-do the stamp. I also take digital images of the<br/>
log book pages every time I do a maintenance visit, to keep as a<br/>
permanent record should the logbook go missing. <br/>
<br/>
Because I'm also a geocacher I know where the geocaches are in my area<br/>
and I don't hide an LB close to one. It's not likely that a geocacher<br/>
will stumble upon my LBs. If a geocacher hides a cache next to my LB<br/>
I'll also know about it because I check the gc.com site frequently for<br/>
new caches in the area. <br/>
<br/>
Also, when I hide a letterbox hybrid and post it on geocaching.com I<br/>
make it very clear on my cache page that there are no trades allowed<br/>
(do not leave trinkets) and that my carved stamp must remain in the<br/>
box. I also encourage cachers to draw a picture or leave a nature<br/>
stamp. So far cachers have been fantastic. I've had a great time going<br/>
over the log books and finding stick figure drawings and one of my<br/>
favourites were cachers that left a "stomp", the imprint of their<br/>
boot. Very creative. <br/>
<br/>
I've noticed that when I created my last 2 letterbox hybrids and post<br/>
it on both gc.com and letterboxing.org (and atlasquest) letterboxers<br/>
don't visit. Is there an anti-geocaching sentiment among LBers. Or am<br/>
I being too sensitive. <br/>

 I'm on the geocaching list as well, since I log any geocaches found<br/>
while letterboxing.  I posted to the list about a problem with a<br/>
letterbox being turned into a geocache by geocachers mistaking it for<br/>
a letterbox (even though it said letterbox right on the lid).  The<br/>
stamp was missing, box left in disarray etc....  And I got totally<br/>
flamed for it.  (don't flame me here please!! ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's not just here.  There are rude and inconsiderate people<br/>
everywhere.....  If you truly want to leave the list, I'm sorry to see<br/>
you go.  Perhaps there is a local letterboxing mailing list you can<br/>
join?  I find that those are much tamer... perhaps since there are<br/>
less people on them..... (??? thoughts anyone???)<br/>
