mention another "mystery" that's been puzzling me for a long time now.  It's actually <br/>
about one of the mapsurfer boxes that was not supposed to be a mystery, and should <br/>
have been one of the easiest ones of his to get, had it not been for that fact that it seems <br/>
to have "disappeared", and no one I've asked seems to know anything about it!  The <br/>
"mystery" then becomes how to relocate this box and get it back in motion - something <br/>
that should not be too difficult considering it's a chance for anyone interested to get a <br/>
genuine mapsurfer box with perhaps less effort than is generally required for his boxes <br/>
(except, of course, for  that super easy "Pandora" one that Mark Pepe "spilled the beans <br/>
on" when he was still a "newbie" letterboxer three years ago, and we still had to give him <br/>
many hints before he finally found it!!!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this box we are talking about now  is the F500 Box that mapsurfer sent to us <br/>
several years ago.   We were asked to stamp our 500th find into it, and try to get other <br/>
people to stamp their 500th find into this box in chronological order as they also reached <br/>
F500.  We shared the box at a little F500 gathering in CT, incorporating people's photos as <br/>
a sort of letterboxing "history of achievement" as mapsurfer had suggested for us to do, <br/>
for about the first dozen or so recipients that were there. Then, around Christmas time of <br/>
2003, we passed the box along to Dan and Melissa of Voluntown, CT, who thanked us via <br/>
e-mail.  Since then, despite our repeated inquiries, no one seems to have heard anything <br/>
about it!<br/>
<br/>
By now, of course, there are many more people eligible for this box, so we surely expect <br/>
that someone out there will be able to solve this "mystery" and get this special box back <br/>
into circulation.  It seems there was also at one time a mapsurfer F100 box that <br/>
"disappeared" for almost a year, apparently waiting for people to reach that goal before <br/>
passing it along, and we don't know where that box is now either.  But, we're sure <br/>
someone out there can solve these "mysteries" and maybe get a genuine mapsurfer <br/>
letterbox or two in the process!<br/>
<br/>
As the mapsurfer himself would say, (we enjoyed the saying so much we took it over for <br/>
ourselves!)<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
