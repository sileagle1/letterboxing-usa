I'm really excited.  I talked a friend into joining me tomorrow morning on<br/>
my first letterboxing adventure.  It's a short hike and doesn't sound too<br/>
difficult for a newbie.   Have to get an early start before it gets too hot.<br/>
 Since I only heard of letterboxing less than a week ago, I haven't had time<br/>
to actually carve my own stamp so will have to use one from my collection.  <br/>
Hope to get to the "big city" next week to buy the supplies to carve my own.<br/>
 I do have some great carving tools from a woodblock print carving class I<br/>
took in Japan years ago.  I knew if I kept them long enough, they'd come in<br/>
handy again.  lol<br/>

<br/>
Hope your first letterboxing adventure is a great one.  I too am a  newbie <br/>
and just loving going out to find boxes.  I've found 25 since June  and have <br/>
gotten my kids hooked as well.  We did some traveling to New York  and New Jersey <br/>
this summer and found boxes while vacationing. <br/>
<br/>
Take care.....GlobeBear<br/>
