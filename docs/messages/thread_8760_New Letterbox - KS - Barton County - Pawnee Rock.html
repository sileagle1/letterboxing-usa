Difficulty - simple<br/>
Time - drive up<br/>
Directions to starting place - Kansas Highway 56.  When you reach <br/>
Pawnee Rock (the town), follow signs as you drive  mile north to<br/>
the rock<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Details you should know - <br/>
Pawnee Rock was named for an Indian battle between the Pawnees and <br/>
Comanches. The landmark was located near Fort Larned in the buffalo <br/>
hunting territory of the Pawnees. As a famous natural fortress on the <br/>
Santa Fe Trail, it became known as the "Prairie Citadel."   Pawnee <br/>
Rock was an outcrop of Dakota Sandstone on which travelers carved <br/>
their names, making it look like a hotel register. Settlers have used <br/>
most of the rock for building material, but what is left of it has<br/>
now been preserved as a state park.  Please do not carve your name.  <br/>
<br/>
Details you don't need to know, but might enjoy - <br/>
I have been told by local people that the rock is one third as high<br/>
as it used to be before people started carting off the rock.  "Many <br/>
stories have been told to explain how Pawnee Rock got its name.  A <br/>
tradition among white plainsmen was that the Rock received its name<br/>
in 1826 from an embarrassing mistake by Kit Carson. A raw youth of <br/>
seventeen, Carson was on his first trip into the West. The wagon<br/>
train with which he was working camped for the night near the Rock.<br/>
He was given guard duty. In the dark, he shot his own mule, thinking <br/>
it was an attacking Pawnee. His unkind associates commemorated his <br/>
unfortunate experience with the name, Pawnee Rock."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues:	Drive up to the top of the hill and look in the tree with a <br/>
bunch of trunks in the Northwest corner of the fenced in area.   <br/>
Gloves would be a good idea when reaching in.  <br/>
