My definition of a mini-letterbox is about a 2"x2"x1" container <br/>
(plastic, tin (altoids/everest gum), etc.), and a micro-letterbox is <br/>
typically a 35 mm film canister or something of a similar size which <br/>
would have a log that rolls up tightly and a small stamp... I <br/>
occasionally include a really tiny pen/pencil &amp; sharpener if they <br/>
will fit.<br/>

Thanks for your help!  I was wondering how you managed the log in a <br/>
microbox.  Thanks to you also Sam I am, for your reply.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The first microbox I found had a long piece of paper in it rather than a <br/>
rolled up "booklet". I have since adopted this technique: I use butcher paper <br/>
which is quite thin, cut it to about 10" X 18" and fold it to fit in a film <br/>
canister (the most water-tight box on earth). This way, even if people have <br/>
big stamps, they can fit them on. Of course, you might have to check <br/>
microboxes more often to put fresh paper in.<br/>
