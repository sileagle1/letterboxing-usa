                    <div class="plaintext-content">I hope that many of you will come down here and hunt out some of the <br/>
letterboxes that have appeared in Florida. However after this summer, <br/>
and particularly this past week, I can see the bad press coming so I <br/>
wanted to make a couple suggestions to make your visit and letterbox <br/>
hunting fun and safe. This past couple weeks in central Florida where <br/>
I live we have had one gator attack, 6 shark attacks, and the most <br/>
intense lighting storm I have seen in a very long time. What you are <br/>
likely to see in the press is that Florida is the shark attack <br/>
capital of the world, the gator attack capital of the US, and the <br/>
lighting strike capital of the US. All of this is probably true but <br/>
should be kept in perspective. Gator attacks are very rare and <br/>
generally occur when someone is foolish enough to swim at night in a <br/>
lake or gets into grassy areas along the shorelines. Never let a <br/>
small child swim in a lake out of arms reach (_all_ lakes have <br/>
gators) even in the daytime.  Shark attacks are fairly common on the <br/>
atlantic coast of central Florida (15 in Volusia county so far this <br/>
year) as a result of people's arms and legs being mistaken for bait <br/>
fish by migrating sharks in murky water, and rarely fatal. Stay away <br/>
from bait pods splashing in the ocean and don't swim at dusk or <br/>
night. Lighting is another story. In reality it is a much greater <br/>
danger than the critters. An article in the paper this weekend stated <br/>
that on average 10 people a year are killed by lighting in Florida <br/>
every year and many times that are injured seriously. Take <br/>
thunderstorms seriously and go inside until they pass, which is <br/>
usually only a short time. So come on down and have a great time <br/>
hunting letterboxes and exploring the "real" Florida using just a <br/>
little common sense. Just remember once you leave Mickey's house you <br/>
are not in the Magic Kingdom anymore. Wild Florida is beautiful, <br/>
welcome to the jungle!<br/>
