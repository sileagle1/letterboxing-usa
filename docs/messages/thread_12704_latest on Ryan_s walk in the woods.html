And the erosion charges down!  (Switchbacks are annoying for the hiker but <br/>
better for the environment.)  I too was surprised by Ryan's umbrella--people <br/>
who live in Oregon joke that people who live in Oregon don't carry umbrellas.<br/>

    Dear Sir Wizard, <br/>
  I bow to you! Actually, I was going to write that it was "quite <br/>
British" of him! But I thought my hate club would find some way to <br/>
come out of their closet to send me flames.<br/>
  I just have to chuckle when I picture him with his parasol, <br/>
sashaying along the trail! I've been reading other AT hikers journals <br/>
in hopes that someone mentions Ryan.<br/>
  Glad to see you are still around, and I can assure you some USA <br/>
L'boxer will find his boxes. You underestimate our drive and <br/>
determination. I absolutely agree 1 AT box = 5F. :-)<br/>

&gt; Psychomommy<br/>
<br/>
I double bow to thee ..! <grin><br/>
<br/>
Yep I believe you...<br/>
<br/>
If there is one, two-word phrase for letterboxers-USA it is "CAN DO !!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I am with you.... I am totally (CA speak) convinced that The AT boxes<br/>
will be found....esp those close to touristy visit spots...<br/>
<br/>
I am equally totally amazed at Ryan's Adventure....<br/>
<br/>
This time of year it can get hot, wet and very insecty on that there<br/>
pathway thru the trees ! <grin><br/>
<br/>
Carrying just water and a change of clothes is tough enough...carrying<br/>
boxes is positively heroic !<br/>
<br/>
It's great to hear from you ...<br/>
<br/>
I'm really jealous of all the fun on your side of the pond....<br/>
<br/>
Sadly I'm over here working....well actually I LIKE working...but it does<br/>
limit my F count...and yep I did mean F and wrote P ...<br/>
<br/>
Oh well a brain transplant is needed it seems <lol><br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing to thee and thine...<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>
