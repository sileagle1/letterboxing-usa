just had to chime in and add my two cents. I love black cats and had two who<br/>
<br/>
were part Maine coon cats, so they had beautiful long black hair. They were <br/>
brothers, and were named Quin and Quincy when I adopted them, but were<br/>
renamed <br/>
to Itchy and Scratchy. Itchy is still around, but Scratchy turned up MIA<br/>

They insist that a mug of water be left for them in<br/>
the bathroom sink so that they can drink when the mood<br/>
strikes.  Forget about the numerous water dishes we<br/>
have all over the house.<br/>
<br/>
Phantom, our torty calico enjoys chewing on plastic<br/>
bags.  No swallowing or even putting it into her<br/>
mouth, just crunching a little with her teeth.  Her<br/>
brother did the same before we lost him earlier this<br/>
year  :(<br/>
<br/>
And Chaucer, our token male enjoys being massaged with<br/>
my deep-muscle massaging wand.  He's especially happy<br/>
when I turn the heat feature on!!!<br/>
