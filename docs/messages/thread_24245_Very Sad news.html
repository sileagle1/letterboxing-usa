                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just want to send out a heartfelt apology. It seems that someone has stolen our HH Hostel in our Cracked Pots series. The requirement was for a minimum of 2 HH's to be in it at all times. We assume there were at least that many at the time of vandalism. We have no real record of who or what was there last however the last visitors to the other boxes were in mid November. If anyone visited around then and knows what they stamped maybe we can figure out what was lost. Again we are very sorry and we do intend to re-hide a new one and in a better locale as soon as possible.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That is really very depressing.  Sorry you lost your HHs and the box.  I lost <br/>
my first placed box and I thought I would not plant a box again.  I got over <br/>
it.  I have lost boxes since in the same park but in totally different places. <br/>
 The boxes are easy and attracts many new boxers and famlies with young kids  <br/>
So use store bought stzamps now and take the hit..<br/>
