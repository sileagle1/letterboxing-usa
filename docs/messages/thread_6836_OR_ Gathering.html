much with some folks.<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to Funhog for organizing, Annette (I think it was <br/>
her) for the event stamps, Ledger de Maine for the cookies and <br/>
Flutterby, ? for the Nebraska box, and ? for the Lighthouse box. And <br/>
of course everyone who attended or who otherwise helped out in some <br/>
way. We enjoyed meeting everyone and letterboxing with you! For <br/>
those that missed it there are tons of boxes in the area now to be <br/>
found - several we didn't even have time for.<br/>
<br/>
Other than being late and running into some stinging nettles <br/>
everything was great. And a least we now know what nettles look like!<br/>
