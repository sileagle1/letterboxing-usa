Every now and again somebody asks about handicapped accessible <br/>
letterboxes.  <br/>
So in a collabrative effort between myself(the letterboxer formerly <br/>
known as JustBeth) and the Army Corp of Engineers at Hop Brook Lake.  <br/>
We have created the first ever, totally handicapped accessible <br/>
letterbox. <br/>
For you purest letterboxers be warned this box is a real "drive by" <br/>
it can be reached without even leaving your car. <br/>
<br/>
Off Route 63 in Middlebury is Allerton Farms Road. You will find a <br/>
small house used as offices for the Hop Brook Lake Rangers. In the <br/>
parking lot is a brown mailbox with a combination lock. All you need <br/>
to do is bring the combination with you. 4-3-2-1. <br/>

&gt; letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
I applaud the effort.  It is wonderful to see more people being <br/>
mindful of disability while planting, but I am a bit surprised to <br/>
hear you call your box the first ever handicap accessible letterbox.  <br/>
I myself have planted several, and I'm certainly not the first.  If <br/>
you do a search on Atlasquest (one of it's really nice features) for <br/>
wheelchair accessible boxes, you will see that 279 boxes come up and <br/>
keep in mind that Atlasquest only has letterboxes that planters <br/>
themselves have chosen to list.  I'm sure there are many, many more <br/>
besides those ones.<br/>
<br/>
I think your box is a great idea still though, and I'm sure it will <br/>
be enjoyed by many to come.  There are a lot of fun places to plant <br/>
that can be enjoyed by more people.  I have enjoyed seeking out <br/>
nature trails that are paved so as to be wheelchair accessible <br/>
still.  My friends in wheelchairs and with other disabilities have <br/>
expressed appreciation for places and activities being adapted for <br/>
them to enjoy too.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on, and (pun intended) Happy Boxing Day!<br/>
