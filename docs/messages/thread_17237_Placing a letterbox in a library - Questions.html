nope regular box<br/>
special placement with consideration for particular audience<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Did you choose a book to adapt that would be less likely to be <br/>
&gt; examined (i.e. an older reference-type book vs. a best-seller so it <br/>
&gt; could hide in a less traveled part of a library?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking it would not have been an older reference (ie: more<br/>
delicate book) that was avoided. I actually donated a book to this<br/>
section of the library that went with the theme of the box! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If the library director/administrator granted permission, did he/she <br/>
&gt; inform other staff about the letterbox-book?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and I was happy to provide information sheets from the maine lbna<br/>
facts page that could be given to the staff members. I made sure to<br/>
emphasize that the staff would not have to do anything to maintain<br/>
this box... <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Among my concerns is that the library will see this as a PR <br/>
&gt; opportunity and make the whole thing a lot more public than I would <br/>
&gt; wish.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
nope, generally the library can't be bothered as it would require<br/>
staff time/hours and additionally a good amount of time on your part<br/>
too. I did offer to hold a class/workshop and/or a story time relating<br/>
to the book in the library for free.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I'm also considering a museum as a repository for a letterbox. Do you <br/>
&gt; have any experience with this? <br/>
<br/>
Yup, decided against it primarily as it was not as much of a public<br/>
access spot -ie: you would pay to have access to the museum...<br/>

No problem, hope it helped. If you're ever in the area, let me know<br/>
and I'd be happy to meet up at the library in Bangor! :-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi--although we haven't placed a letterbox in a library per se, we <br/>
have placed a handful of letterboxes in similar establishments--<br/>
including a museum, an historic conservatory and a bookstore.  <br/>
Initially, we were quite apprehensive about 'approaching the <br/>
authorities' but were rather surprised and somewhat invigorated <br/>
after we were welcomed with enthusiastic responses.<br/>
<br/>
For example--we first approached the curator of a museum in our <br/>
neighborhood about placing a letterbox within the museum.  Not only <br/>
were we welcomed with open arms but the curator begged us for extra <br/>
copies of the clues to hand out to future visitors.  She even <br/>
encouraged us to meet with the principal of the local elementary <br/>
school because she wanted us to 'get the word out' about <br/>
letterboxing.  This dear lady (in her mid 80s!!!) now tells <br/>
everybody who visits the museum about letterboxing and is quite <br/>
convinced that it is an excellent way to encourage children to <br/>
explore their surroundings and to learn something about the history <br/>
of their area.<br/>
<br/>
**From a security standpoint, it's also nice to let the owner of the <br/>
facility know about an 'abandoned' package on their property so they <br/>
are aware that it doesn't bear a more sinister intent with our <br/>
heightened security concerns these days.**<br/>
<br/>
One thing I've found that helps tremendously in proselytizing the <br/>
merits of letterboxing is if I discuss its 150 year history in one <br/>
of England's National Parks and how enthusiastically it is supported <br/>
in Connecticut's parks, too.  Believe me, the fact that letterboxing <br/>
is a Victorian era hobby is truly what helped me gain permission to <br/>
hide a letterbox in a Victorian conservatory!!!  You never know what <br/>
the response will be until you try.  Who knows?  You may gain some <br/>
new area letterboxers in the process, too...<br/>
<br/>
Have a wonderful letterboxing day! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I placed a letterbox book in a library with the help of a staff <br/>
person and permission of the librarian.  Staff changed.  Librarian <br/>
changed.  The letterbox disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
There was a beautiful letterbox here in Nern VA for a while, probably <br/>
without permission, before it disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
The staff person I knew had also placed three hollowed out book <br/>
letterboxes in the library herself.  Her problem was people kept <br/>
bringing them to the check out to "check them out".  Sometimes not <br/>
even knowing they were hollowed out.<br/>
<br/>
The library problem is that the staff constantly moves the collection <br/>
around and straightens and checks the shelves.  Something that <br/>
doesn't belong won't last long.  However.  If you choose a book <br/>
that "belongs", label it well, just like the surrounding books, it <br/>
might last longer.  Also the higher numbers, 700 to 900 I think, get <br/>
less traffic which will help.<br/>
<br/>
I have a new idea to tempt librarians.  Now that there is a <br/>
commercially printer letterbox book, "The Letterboxers Companion" by <br/>
Randy Hall, I am going to offer to donate that book and ask if I can <br/>
also place my book letterbox somewhere too.  I'll let y'all know how <br/>
I do.  <br/>
<br/>
Another idea I have is to take the "Companion" book and take it <br/>
apart.  I would take 100 pages or so and cut out the space for the <br/>
stamp, then rebind the whole thing together.  The blank part of the <br/>
cut out pages would be the log.<br/>
<br/>
Incidently I still have a Word file that is a Letterbox Book.  It <br/>
contains a brief description of letterboxing followed by a bunch of <br/>
letterbox clues from the area.  At the end are a hundred pages or so <br/>
to cut out for the stamp with plenty of space for stamping in on <br/>
those pages.  The idea is to strip my clues and replace with your own <br/>
local clues, print it out and assemble it.  Then carve a stamp and <br/>
tie it into the binding.  My books are velobound. I'll send the file <br/>
to anyone who wants it.<br/>
<br/>
Below I'll try to answer the questions.<br/>

The "box" was a hollowed out book in the shelves complete with filing <br/>
numbers on the spine.  A book that "doesn't belong" where it is is <br/>
more likely to disappear.  My book was called "The Letterbox Book" <br/>
and was placed in the local area hiking section.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Did you choose a book to adapt that would be less likely to be <br/>
&gt; examined (i.e. an older reference-type book vs. a best-seller so it <br/>
&gt; could hide in a less traveled part of a library?<br/>
No, but good idea.  Note I talked about identifying less travled <br/>
areas of the shelves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If the library director/administrator granted permission, did <br/>
he/she <br/>
&gt; inform other staff about the letterbox-book?<br/>
Staff person informed everyone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Among my concerns is that the library will see this as a PR <br/>
&gt; opportunity and make the whole thing a lot more public than I would <br/>

Ask for discretion.  Publicity where there is a lot of public can <br/>
lead to vandalism.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm also considering a museum as a repository for a letterbox. Do <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; have any experience with this? <br/>
Museums that I know of that were asked said that they would only <br/>
consider a box at the information desk that someone could ask for.  <br/>
The National Postal Museum did a family "seminar" on letterboxing and <br/>
hid several boxes around the museum on a Sunday afternoon.  It was <br/>
great fun but the boxes would never have lasted for long in public <br/>
the way they were hid.<br/>
A classic way of doing letterboxes involving a place where you can't <br/>
hide them is to have the clues require information from that place <br/>
but hide it somewhere else.  Still it's fun to be in there.<br/>

&gt; examples of other libraries that have knowingly accepted letterboxes? <br/>
&gt; Did they ASK for names of libraries or librarians who have allowed <br/>
&gt; letterboxes in their libraries? If so, do you have suggestions?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Did you place the box in the stacks where that book would normally <br/>
&gt; have been shelved (i.e alpha order by author)? Or did you hide the <br/>
&gt; letterbox-book behind the shelved books?  Maybe you used a micro-box?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Did you choose a book to adapt that would be less likely to be <br/>
&gt; examined (i.e. an older reference-type book vs. a best-seller so it <br/>
&gt; could hide in a less traveled part of a library?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If the library director/administrator granted permission, did he/she <br/>
&gt; inform other staff about the letterbox-book?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Among my concerns is that the library will see this as a PR <br/>
&gt; opportunity and make the whole thing a lot more public than I would <br/>
&gt; wish.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm also considering a museum as a repository for a letterbox. Do you <br/>
&gt; have any experience with this? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for sharing your experience (either to the list or off-line).<br/>
