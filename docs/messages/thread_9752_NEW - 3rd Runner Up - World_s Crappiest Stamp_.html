<p>As stated in a previous message, Ryan’s ‘piece of ‘art’’ has won the 2002 
contest to determine the WORLD'S CRAPPIEST STAMP! There were many entries, but 
everyone agreed, Ryan’s talent at stamp carving blew the competition away. His 
effort was clearly the WORLD’S CRAPPIEST STAMP!</p>
<p>The completion was stiff. I felt very fortunate to receive the prize for 3rd 
Runner Up. I received permission to place the stamp in a LB, but the judges 
required it be in a bonus box. It has been placed in a good location. For anyone 
who does not want to befoul their logbook with the stamp, the back has the award 
on it, so you can show you got the box without embarrassing yourself 
:-)</p></div></body></html>

   I have a lot of crappy stamps that I've rejected. I was to <br/>

<br/>
I can't speak for everyone else, but as for my Crappy Stamp <br/>
letterbox, I'd rather not have pictures of it spreading around the <br/>
Internet.  But I have no problems if you bump into someone who's <br/>
found it and wants to show off the image to you from their logbook, <br/>
but it would ruin the fun if EVERYONE can see the image!  I think <br/>
this box has a built-in curiosity about it, and putting a picture of <br/>
it online for everyone to see would ruin that effect.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have a lot of crappy stamps that I've rejected. I was to <br/>
&gt; embarrassed to have anyone see them. If crappy is a good thing than<br/>
&gt; I would have a lot more boxes out there than what I've placed.:-)<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing wrong with a crappy stamp.  Granted, normally I don't <br/>
encourage people to go out of their way to carve the crappiest stamp <br/>
they can, but even a crappy stamp can be turned into an absolutely <br/>
wonderful letterbox.  It's all in the presentation.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
But if you feel embarrassed about your carvings, do what I do: Get <br/>
some help from people you've met that DO carve really well.  More <br/>
often than not, they'll give you plenty of great advice and tips!<br/>
<br/>
And of course, practice makes perfect.  Nobody's carved the World's <br/>
Best Stamp on their very first try.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm....  I've already got a lock on the World's Crappiest Stamp.  I <br/>
wonder if I can nab the title for the World's Best Stamp too.  I'll <br/>
have to think about that....  =)<br/>

ya know, i kinda hafta think that the worlds crappiest<br/>
stamp would have to include an image your neighbors<br/>
dogs leavings or commode contents, but maybe im being<br/>
to literal. i have seen some wonderfull stamps, well<br/>
made and not-so-skillfully made, but i think the<br/>
reward is (as well as the jaunt) the light at the end<br/>
of the tunnel, whether it is a 3000 watt halogen lamp<br/>
or 35 watt ge lightbulb shouldnt matter so terribly<br/>
much. i am glad everyone is in such good spirits about<br/>
it though. it doesnt matter, its all fun, and if you<br/>
thoroughly HATE a creation of yours, rework the design<br/>
or get some pointers and try again, practice makes<br/>
perfect. (erasers have 2 sides). <br/>
and i kinda like backwards lettering, intentional or<br/>
not. <br/>
and thank you all for helping me trick the kid into<br/>
practicing her reading and map skills... <br/>
<br/>
just go out and have fun!<br/>
