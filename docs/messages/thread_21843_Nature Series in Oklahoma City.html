Hey!  I just wanted to thank DS for a great afternoon of letterboxing.  <br/>
I was kind of nearby waiting on my husband to finish up a project and <br/>
decided I should just go out to Martin Nature Park and do some <br/>
hunting.  The first box was such a pleasure.  I just sat there for the <br/>
longest time, soaking it all in and taking my time stamping in (I also <br/>
left a little something in it!!!).  As everyone else experienced, a <br/>
goose came up to eat - lovely.  Ahhh, what a beautiful day.  I strolled <br/>
along searching, but never could find #2 (which your clues already said <br/>
was reported missing) OR #3!!! Oh dear.  I saw that on #4 you had to <br/>
stash it somewhere else because it had been picked up.  Same thing <br/>
happened with one of mine.  I didn't bother putting it back, but I <br/>
still have another one that's hidden where I don't think any rangers <br/>
will ever stumble upon it.  Anyway, it was great.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Mandy<br/>
