BRAIN STORMING<br/>
What do you think of a Stamp Hostel at Gatherings?<br/>
I have carved a lot of stamps over the  L   O   N   G  winter and I know I <br/>
will not plant all of them.  This will help get boxes planted sooner. I am <br/>
planning to attend the Mass. gathering and will bring them with me.<br/>
Take Care<br/>

<br/>
Hmm...  I kind of like the idea.  It lets people who'd rather not <br/>
carve still hide hand-carved stamps.  (Or those that are ashamed of <br/>
their carvings, sad as the case may be, but those people do exist!)  <br/>
It lets people who like to carve but not enjoy the work of hiding <br/>
boxes give their stamps to those that would.<br/>
<br/>
So I like that idea.  The only string I'd attach is that nobody is <br/>
allowed to stamp the stamps!  Except for the person who 'adopts' the <br/>
stamp for hiding elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
It's not something I personally would get involved with.  I *like* <br/>
carving stamps, and can do a fine job myself.  But I also like the <br/>
thrill of hiding my own stamps and except in rare instances, wouldn't <br/>
want others hiding my stamps.  So while I think the idea is good, <br/>
it's not necessarily one I'd participate in either.<br/>
<br/>
Carpe diem!<br/>
