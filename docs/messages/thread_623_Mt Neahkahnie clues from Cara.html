Sorry, I answered my own question after I sent the email!  Here is my clue:<br/>
Coastal Indians thought this beachside mountaintop was a viewpoint fit for<br/>
gods and named it with the words Ne ("place of") and Ekahni ("supreme<br/>
deity").  </neahkahnie.jpg></div>

	I can feel the coolness of the swirling mists and the chop-chop of the<br/>
waves at the base.  Great interpretive forms and a dynamic tone reversal<br/>
as the open ocean beats against the shore.  Very nice, what did you use<br/>
for tools and carving medium.<br/>
<br/>
	I'm looking forward to seeing more stamps - thanks for sharing.<br/>

Well, I really don't remember what the carving medium is...maybe PZ Cut?<br/>
It's not as firm as the white vinyl erasers, which I like alot, but I could<br/>
buy big sheets of it at a lower cost than most of the other stuff. For<br/>
carving I used the linoleum carving kit (brand??)that was whithin my limited<br/>
price range. Since I'm just learning to carve, I didn't want to invest in<br/>
some ultra fancy carving kit. It was fun (except for the stiff neck and back<br/>
that resulted) sitting on a driftwood log, looking up at the mountain<br/>
through all the mist and carving the stamp.  I hope someone finds it!<br/>
