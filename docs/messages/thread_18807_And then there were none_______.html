For those new to using the clue pages, there is a feature named "contact the<br/>

exclusionary tactics like the nomination process for "veterans" <br/>
lists, secret handshakes, etc.) is a step towards killing the game <br/>
altogether.  The act of placing a letterbox for others to find is in <br/>
essence an act of sharing.  Whether it means the sharing of a great <br/>
stamp, or an intriguing quest, or a picturesque local, a box placed <br/>
is an act of goodwill towards others.  Hoarding information, clues, <br/>
or insight gained by hard-earned experience goes against the very <br/>
nature of letterboxing, the way I see it. <br/>

&gt; Very well put!  It seems the urge to "posess" the game (by <br/>
&gt; exclusionary tactics like the nomination process for "veterans" <br/>

&gt; altogether. <br/>
<br/>
Actually, I think this would make the game all the more fun. The element of mystery <br/>
would be there. There will always be the boxes for all to find and then there would be <br/>

<br/>
&gt;The act of placing a letterbox for others to find is in <br/>
&gt; essence an act of sharing.  Whether it means the sharing of a great <br/>
&gt; stamp, or an intriguing quest, or a picturesque local, a box placed <br/>
&gt; is an act of goodwill towards others.  <br/>
<br/>
It is defintely a wonderful an act of sharing. However there is a school of thinking in this <br/>
group that a letterbox in the wild is no longer the property of the creator. This attitude is <br/>
the thing that has put a monkey wrench into the works. Some letterboxers feel that the <br/>
act of sharing is just that and not one of absolute surrender.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Hoarding information, clues, <br/>
&gt; or insight gained by hard-earned experience goes against the very <br/>
&gt; nature of letterboxing, the way I see it. <br/>
<br/>
Actually, the way it's been done historically in Dartmoor is MUCH more exclusionary. You <br/>
can't even get the clue book until you've found a hundred boxes! Finding those is the <br/>
membership card to the club and can take considerable stealth. This cloak and dagger <br/>
aspect of boxing is one of the things that attracted me to the hobby in the first place. <br/>

I think one of the challenges we face on this big list is the <br/>
differences between our involvement. For some, boxing is a Sunday <br/>
pastime - for others, it's almost a way of life. While we all look at <br/>
this "thing" a little differently than the next letterboxer, the <br/>
primary idea to keep in mind is that we should respect all <br/>
positions, all views, everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

is <br/>

anyone <br/>

these <br/>

on  <br/>

&gt; technical nuances, and there are many. All it takes is patience and <br/>
&gt; digging. You may argue that you do not have time for research. Then <br/>
&gt; maybe this is not the activity for you at this point in your life. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The bottom line, and forgive me for saying this again, no list or <br/>
sub-<br/>
&gt; list, no forum and no database is letterboxing. Having clues in <br/>
hand, <br/>

extent.  The element of mystery is another part of the game.  <br/>
Difficult clues and mystery boxes are very rewarding puzzles when  <br/>
unravelled.  Some clues read like entrance exams into a secret <br/>
world, and that's awesome.  It seems like we may share the view that <br/>
varying levels of difficulty in clues adds a nice spice to the game.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I can't pretend to know what it is about Dartmoor that makes <br/>
its letterboxing more "cloak and dagger" than ours.  I've never been <br/>
to Dartmoor.  Maybe there's something unique in its culture that <br/>
fostered this more exclusionary approach to letterboxing, I don't <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think anyone can disagree with me when I say US boxing is <br/>
very different from Dartmoor boxing.   They have an arduous process <br/>
by which clues are acquired: 100 boxes found before clues are <br/>
accessed.  (I've never quite understood how those first 100 are <br/>
found without the clues, but I digress.)  We have clues posted on <br/>
the world wide web for anyone with a modem to access.  Their sport <br/>
is practically historic, we have internet talk lists and <br/>
gatherings.  When you think about it, it's not really fair to either <br/>
to hold one up to the traditions or advances of the other.  They are <br/>
unique unto themselves.<br/>
<br/>
What is it about US boxing that makes it the way it is?  I'm going <br/>
to sidestep the flag waving to answer that question.  Fact is, I'm <br/>
not sure why our boxing is the way it is anymore than I can explain <br/>
the character of Dartmoor boxes.  I do know one thing: the game is <br/>
what you make it.  Easy clues, hard clues, whatever.  It's a <br/>
wonderful thing as long as we don't get too caught up in ego and <br/>
status.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to think that veterans have a lot more to offer the Lb <br/>
community than raspberries blown into the faces of those who are <br/>
just learning the ropes.  There are a lot of people who are sitting <br/>
on a wealth of information and insight.  They could be role models <br/>
to the rest of them if they choose to be.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Funhog, for sharing your insight.<br/>

<br/>
But...<br/>

Alafair said: (forgive me for the small clip out of context)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If a person has a negative emotional reaction to the secretive <br/>
nature <br/>
&gt; of some letterboxers and their clues, then perhaps putting oneself <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; the shoes of the box owner is in order. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For me, personally, I have a negative emotional reaction NOT to the <br/>
secretive nature, but the way in which it's presented.  Let's look at <br/>
the Lemony Snicket posts and subsequent disagreement.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a literary person by nature and I simply ADORE the whole idea of <br/>
the LS boxes.  Someday I hope to get at least the Florida one!  BUT, <br/>
I joined the list after the initial post.  I tried to go back through <br/>
the archives but there are FORTY THOUSAND posts.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, let's just suppose I was a complete newbie, and signed up <br/>
excited about learning this new hobby.  Perhaps I wouldn't have had <br/>
any problem at ALLLL seeing that it was 'secret and mysterious'....or <br/>
even figuring it out and enjoying the hunt as I was supposed <br/>
to....once I knew that there WERE such a thing as 'secretive clues'!  <br/>
In order to find the game and enjoy it, you first have to know the <br/>
game exists!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoy the mystery of the game as much as everyone else <br/>
here.  I really really do.  BUT, I do have a problem with being SO <br/>
secretive that we can't, as a group, politely tell the newcomers that <br/>
there IS a mystery that they can seek.  I don't have a negative <br/>
emotional response to the fact that it's part of the game-- only the <br/>
way it seems to scare off half the people that ask for help.  How <br/>
many of those people might be the NEXT great carver?  Or might miss <br/>
out on the complete WONDERFULNESS of your incredible box and stamp <br/>
simply because noone took a second to answer them politely?<br/>
<br/>
I am absolutely NOT using the Lemony posts as anything other than an <br/>
example simply because it's fresh in everyone's minds.  I mean no <br/>
disrespect to their creator at all.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I've either insulted you or won your support (this sort of <br/>
issue seems to have only two sides), I'll stop down off that box.<br/>
<br/>
But please, for GOODNESS SAKES people, remember that even YOU once <br/>
upon a time didn't know there was such a thing as letterboxing....or <br/>
email lists.....or even the internet.....<br/>
<br/>
Every single one of you started somewhere with a spark of interest.  <br/>
In my humble opinion you *owe it* to your hobby to give other people <br/>
at least the opportunity to choose based on just a bit of <br/>
information, politely dispensed.  You really can sincerely say "I'm <br/>
not going to tell you because finding the information is part of the <br/>
game."  I do it with my students every single day in my classroom.  <br/>
They come away learning as much about themselves as the information <br/>
they were seeking.<br/>

Thanks, Funhog, for sharing your insight.<br/>

I would certainly like to think so. I would like to think that after almost 3 <br/>
years and over 400 boxes I would fall under the veteran/elder category, and I <br/>
do not mind that people ask questions that we've all heard many times before. <br/>
Granted, my learning style is to sit back and soak it all in and not ask <br/>
questions unless I cannot seek out the answer on my own, but I do understand that <br/>
others have different learning styles. For some, they feel the quickest way to <br/>
an answer is to ask.<br/>
<br/>
I've been sitting back for most of this line of discussion, but I have to say <br/>
that I don't think that anything is wrong with asking questions - new or old <br/>
- repeated or not. Just don't read them if you don't want to be bothered by <br/>
them...that's what I've been doing. (Heck, most of the things on the list have <br/>
not been worth reading lately)  But then again, for those who ask, there will <br/>
be the few of us who will give the same gracious and patient answer or <br/>
redirection to the FAQ no matter how often they come up. That is what makes a mentor.<br/>
That is also the welcoming attitude that first attracted me to this list.<br/>
<br/>
It is very true that the talk list is NOT the hobby (although, I think that <br/>
for some it has become a secondary hobby/obsession), but it does make me sad to <br/>
see the talk group continue to splinter and splinter...first into regional <br/>
lists and now into newcomer/veteran lists Everyone has been complaining that <br/>
"newbies" aren't taking the time to explore the site and find out the things they <br/>
need to know... but how can anyone seriously think that fracturing into a <br/>
whole bunch of sites or sub-sites will make it any easier for them to find <br/>
ANYTHING?<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward with hope...<br/>

<br/>
It seems to me that a lot of people who feel 'excluded' tend to be <br/>
new letterboxers that haven't realized this yet.  They come in <br/>
assuming that all clues are readily accessible on LbNA and are <br/>
horrified to learn when they aren't.  And they haven't figured out <br/>
the ropes on how to acquire them either.  They haven't learned <br/>
the "who's who" in letterboxing or developed letterboxing <br/>
acquaintences to share information with.<br/>
<br/>
I see words like 'elitism' being thrown around, and it just makes me <br/>
cringe.  My boxes tend to be more difficult than average to get, but <br/>
I do that so they'll be more special for those who go through the <br/>
effort to actually nab them. That, and the fewer people who find my <br/>
boxes, the less maintenance is required of them.  So I just make <br/>
cracking the clue or the hike to the box more difficult than <br/>
average.  Makes it harder for my 'enemies' to sabatoge my boxes as <br/>
well.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
I'm not big on creating 'word-of-mouth' clues--I don't really like <br/>
searching for the CLUE, I like searching for the boxes!  So you know <br/>
what I do?  I don't look for the clue!  It's no sweat off my back.  <br/>
Sometimes they happen to pass through my inbox unexpectedly and I'll <br/>
hang onto the them, but I don't go searching through archives or <br/>
googling the web to find clues.  It's just not the kind of thing I'm <br/>
interested in.<br/>
<br/>
I also don't like drive-by boxes.  I like a challenge in acquiring a <br/>
letterbox, and parking a stone's throw from the letterbox holds <br/>
absolutely no appeal to me at all.  I've been known to drive right <br/>
on past known boxes less than a hundred feet away just because I <br/>
thought they were too easy and dull so held no interest to me.<br/>
<br/>
That's not an attack against such boxes--it's just not my kind of <br/>
box.  Based on the number of people logging into to them, however, <br/>
it seems that most people DO like such boxes.  In this group, you <br/>
can't go wrong hiding a drive-by!<br/>
<br/>
There's a lot of letterboxes out there, and many people who are <br/>
hiding them want to do something unique.  Something to make them <br/>
stand out from the rest.  And sometimes, making the clue difficult <br/>
to acquire is one way of doing that.  Heaven knows we've learned <br/>
more about Lemony Snicket than we'd need to know in a lifetime <br/>
because the clues aren't listed on LbNA.  Maybe he deliberately <br/>
wanted to make the clues hard-to-get in keeping with character.  <br/>
Maybe he doesn't want new letterboxers looking for it--afraid they <br/>
won't rehide it well enough.  (Based on what I've heard, they're <br/>
remarkable boxes and it's understandable he might be extra cautious <br/>
with them.)  Or maybe he's an illegal immigrant and doesn't want to <br/>
draw attention to himself or his boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I've had new letterboxers ask me questions about some of my <br/>
questions, and I've flat out told them I wouldn't recommend they <br/>
look for the box.  Not that I didn't want them to look, but rather I <br/>
didn't think they'd be able to find the box, and I didn't want them <br/>
to be disappointed if they went home empty-handed.  Some letterboxes <br/>
are notoriously difficult to find where even experienced boxers have <br/>
trouble finding them.  A new letterboxer probably wouldn't have a <br/>
chance!  (For those in the know, the first box I tried to find was <br/>
the Multnomah Falls box--and I failed miserably.  It's a tough box <br/>
for anyone to find, but as a newbie, I really didn't have a chance!)<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing elitist or snobbish about any of these activities.  <br/>
Not all boxes are created equal, and not all boxes are designed with <br/>
YOU in mind.  There's as many kinds of boxes are there are people <br/>
hiding them.  If you don't enjoy looking for obscure clues posted <br/>
months ago in the talk list, don't.  It's not a big deal.  If you <br/>
don't like solving mind-numbing cryptic puzzles like my Walking Tour <br/>
Series, skip it.  If you don't want to hike 15 miles for a <br/>
letterbox, don't.  It's not meant for you.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of letterboxes out there designed for new <br/>
letterboxers, and there are a lot out there designed for more <br/>
experienced letterboxers.  It takes all types.  Every letterbox has <br/>
an intended audience, and if you're not part of it, let it go.  Find <br/>
one that is.<br/>
<br/>
I've been saying this for a long time, but I should also point out: <br/>
Every POST on this board has an intended audience as well.  The <br/>
system for using state abbreviations in the subject title was <br/>
designed to help get your message to its intended audience.  The <br/>
regional talk lists have been created for the same reason.  <br/>
Sometimes, when people can't find a certain person's e-mail address, <br/>
they'll post a message with a subject saying: "For Lemony Snicket" <br/>
or whatever the case may be--so at a quick glance you can see if <br/>
you're part of the intended audience.  (A *very* narrow one, in this <br/>
case.)  In fact, that's the primary purpose of the subject on these <br/>
posts: So people can figure out if a given post is something that <br/>
they would be interested in.  If you can't tell what a post is about <br/>
or who it is meant for, it's a bad subject.  Which, I might add, <br/>
includes this post--what the hell does "And then there were none..." <br/>
supposed to mean?  Am I supposed to read that?  Does it have <br/>
anything to do with me?  However, I choose to leave the subject as <br/>
is in my reply because anyone reading this thread--who IS my <br/>
intended audience--will know it's a continuation of this thread and <br/>
read this post.  And those who aren't following the thread will skip <br/>
it--as well it should be.<br/>
<br/>
Newbies vs. oldies: It's a stupid argument.  This is not a 'no <br/>
rules' hobby, contrary to popular belief.  If there's conflicts <br/>
between newbies and oldies, it's because newbies haven't learned the <br/>
ropes yet.  And reality doesn't mesh with their expectations.  <br/>
Oldies (for the most part) try to help explain how things are done <br/>
and why.  Sometimes it's just tradition, and sometimes there's a <br/>
good reason for it.  We've all been in that awkward 'newbie' stage, <br/>
and most of us eventually grow out of it into a 'mature, older-and-<br/>
wiser oldie'.<br/>
<br/>
However, we actually have two kinds of newbies that frequent this <br/>
board: New letterboxers, and new computer users.  I like to help new <br/>
letterboxers, show them the ropes, and be supportive.  New computer <br/>
users--I admit, they get under my skin sometimes and I do or say <br/>
things I later regret.  While they're very happy to take help about <br/>
letterboxing, they tend to be very upset if you try to explain the <br/>
ways of the World Wide Web.  But if you're going to use this medium <br/>
for communication, you have to learn how to use it properly.  You <br/>
have to learn simple things like to read the FAQs before posting a <br/>
question that the FAQ already answers.  You have to learn how to use <br/>
Google to find other websites that might relate to what you're <br/>
doing.  You have to learn how to quote PARTS of a post that you're <br/>
replying too.  You have to learn not to cross-post between several <br/>
talk lists.  It's just good, common-sense Internet etiquette.<br/>
<br/>
And while I applaud a new letterboxer's enthusiasm to learn all <br/>
there is to know about letterboxing, sometimes I wish they had that <br/>
same enthusiasm to learn proper Internet etiquette.<br/>

to see the same questions over and over again on the talk list, we do <br/>
not want to share our experience and help new letterboxers?<br/>
<br/>
Most of the "elders" (for lack of a better description) you accuse of <br/>
throwing raspberries routinely answer e-mail from new letterboxers, <br/>
both from the list and those who just happened upon their clues <br/>
and/or boxes.  Most of them actually take the time to answer e-mail <br/>
from new letterboxers who have written to report a box or hitch hiker <br/>
find (check your old e-mail, I daresay you have a few from me in <br/>
response to your finding my boxes).<br/>
<br/>
If you go back in the archives of this list, you will find that most <br/>
of them routinely give tips, information and advice to questions that <br/>
are not the run-of-the-mill question for which the answer can easily <br/>
be found in the FAQ.  Furthermore, most of these individuals have <br/>
hosted and/or provided workshop instruction at gatherings across the <br/>
country.<br/>
<br/>
Of course it is your choice to label us as cranky old elders and <br/>
assume that we hate newbies.  But inactuality nothing could be <br/>
further from the truth.<br/>

&gt; I agree, very well put, Funhog.  And I agree with you.... to an <br/>
&gt; extent.  The element of mystery is another part of the game.  <br/>
&gt; Difficult clues and mystery boxes are very rewarding puzzles when  <br/>
&gt; unravelled.  Some clues read like entrance exams into a secret <br/>
&gt; world, and that's awesome.  It seems like we may share the view <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; varying levels of difficulty in clues adds a nice spice to the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, I can't pretend to know what it is about Dartmoor that makes <br/>
&gt; its letterboxing more "cloak and dagger" than ours.  I've never <br/>
been <br/>
&gt; to Dartmoor.  Maybe there's something unique in its culture that <br/>
&gt; fostered this more exclusionary approach to letterboxing, I don't <br/>
&gt; know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don't think anyone can disagree with me when I say US boxing is <br/>
&gt; very different from Dartmoor boxing.   They have an arduous process <br/>
&gt; by which clues are acquired: 100 boxes found before clues are <br/>
&gt; accessed.  (I've never quite understood how those first 100 are <br/>
&gt; found without the clues, but I digress.)  We have clues posted on <br/>
&gt; the world wide web for anyone with a modem to access.  Their sport <br/>
&gt; is practically historic, we have internet talk lists and <br/>
&gt; gatherings.  When you think about it, it's not really fair to <br/>
either <br/>
&gt; to hold one up to the traditions or advances of the other.  They <br/>
are <br/>
&gt; unique unto themselves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What is it about US boxing that makes it the way it is?  I'm going <br/>
&gt; to sidestep the flag waving to answer that question.  Fact is, I'm <br/>
&gt; not sure why our boxing is the way it is anymore than I can explain <br/>
&gt; the character of Dartmoor boxes.  I do know one thing: the game is <br/>
&gt; what you make it.  Easy clues, hard clues, whatever.  It's a <br/>
&gt; wonderful thing as long as we don't get too caught up in ego and <br/>
&gt; status.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'd like to think that veterans have a lot more to offer the Lb <br/>
&gt; community than raspberries blown into the faces of those who are <br/>
&gt; just learning the ropes.  There are a lot of people who are sitting <br/>
&gt; on a wealth of information and insight.  They could be role models <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Very well put!  It seems the urge to "posess" the game (by <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; exclusionary tactics like the nomination process for "veterans" <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lists, secret handshakes, etc.) is a step towards killing the <br/>
&gt; game <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; altogether. <br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Actually, I think this would make the game all the more fun. The <br/>
&gt; element of mystery <br/>
&gt; &gt; would be there. There will always be the boxes for all to find <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; then there would be <br/>
&gt; &gt; the hidden clues for those who delve deep.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;The act of placing a letterbox for others to find is in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; essence an act of sharing.  Whether it means the sharing of a <br/>
&gt; great <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stamp, or an intriguing quest, or a picturesque local, a box <br/>
&gt; placed <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is an act of goodwill towards others.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It is defintely a wonderful an act of sharing. However there is a <br/>
&gt; school of thinking in this <br/>
&gt; &gt; group that a letterbox in the wild is no longer the property of <br/>
&gt; the creator. This attitude is <br/>
&gt; &gt; the thing that has put a monkey wrench into the works. Some <br/>
&gt; letterboxers feel that the <br/>
&gt; &gt; act of sharing is just that and not one of absolute surrender.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Hoarding information, clues, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or insight gained by hard-earned experience goes against the <br/>
&gt; very <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; nature of letterboxing, the way I see it. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Actually, the way it's been done historically in Dartmoor is MUCH <br/>
&gt; more exclusionary. You <br/>
&gt; &gt; can't even get the clue book until you've found a hundred boxes! <br/>
&gt; Finding those is the <br/>
&gt; &gt; membership card to the club and can take considerable stealth. <br/>
&gt; This cloak and dagger <br/>
&gt; &gt; aspect of boxing is one of the things that attracted me to the <br/>
&gt; hobby in the first place. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The sneakier the better, as far as I'm concerned. Keeps that old <br/>
&gt; gray matter cookin' <br/>
