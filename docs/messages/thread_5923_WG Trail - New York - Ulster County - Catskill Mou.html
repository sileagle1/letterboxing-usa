                    <div class="plaintext-content">Enjoy this hike! You have started on one that is the most popular in the<br/>
area but then exits it into a " little known"  or I should say<br/>
"abandoned" trail.  One of the stronger storms (Floyd) caused a lot of<br/>
downed trees to fall over it and we have tried to renew its presence. It<br/>
is about half on state land and the other half on a protected<br/>
forever-wild preserve  - please keep it in the best of shape. Watch out<br/>
for bears and their droppings in the middle of the trail especially where<br/>
the trail crosses over the state boundary markings. Slippery when wet! <br/>
Nothing more slippery than bear dung!  The upper mountain is the home of<br/>
rattlesnakes so they may come down to  visit this area when the<br/>
conditions are right. Not much poison ivy around but it is not hard to<br/>
find. <br/>
<br/>
WGT - Southeast New York : Ulster County<br/>
<br/>
Nearest Town: Bearsville / Woodstock , NY<br/>
<br/>
Total Distance: 2.08 miles<br/>
<br/>
Here are the directions/clues to find this letterbox ( WGT ) with our dog<br/>
"BUD" as the stamp design.<br/>
<br/>
1) You will need two hours to do this trail<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2) This is a circular trail and ends at the beginning!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3) Start at the top of Meads mountain next to the Zen Monastery, If the<br/>
parking lot is full, you can  only park along the trail side of the road.<br/>
Park just above the lower field site along the side of the road if the<br/>
parking lot is full.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4)From here walk the 100 or so yards up hill to the start of the Overlook<br/>
trail.<br/>
   The Overlook Trail bulletin board is located here.<br/>
<br/>
5) This is a beautiful hike to the top of the mountain with a great view<br/>
from behind the rangers cabin but the WGT trail starts by telephone pole<br/>
#21. There is water at "Lucky George's"  (named after a one eye blind dog<br/>
who quenched his thirst here on one hot summer day) 1/2 way to pole #21<br/>
on the left side of the main trail. This may dry up sometimes and is only<br/>
for animals to drink<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6) On pole #21 there is a small "W" pointing to the start of the trail,<br/>
20 feet or so away.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
7) Once on this trail you need to keep to the left about 200 feet in and<br/>
take the path leading down this old logging road.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
8) You will cross over three downed trees on the path then  the path <br/>
narrows  as it follows this  washed out logging road. At about 1350 steps<br/>
from the start it makes a sharp turn to the right.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
9) In about 100 feet the many trees have blocked the path. Go around on<br/>
the left side and turn right by the s 6 Red Fungus Plants growing on its<br/>
side. Continue down the path. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
10)The path will go uphill now through mountain laurel for about 100<br/>
yards to a place that has branches stopping you. At this point there is a<br/>
pile of rocks , turn left and you will notice a path heading straight<br/>
down the mountain. ( This is West on a compass)  <br/>
<br/>
11)Be careful you are now in the bear territory!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
12) At this boundary crossing point is where the letter box is hidden.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
13) At the boundary crossing take a few steps further down the trail ,<br/>
then turn around and look back. The rock that is 20 feet above the<br/>
boundary sign that has two  "one foot "  White Birch Trees growing from<br/>
the right side has the box hidden in the crevice. ( It is further covered<br/>
by 4 small flat rocks).. SEE PICTURE [that's BUD by the rock]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
14) This spot is almost half way back to the starting point. (If you<br/>
started below State Parking area)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
15) Continuing down the trail for another 200 feet leads you into a level<br/>
area where the trail is difficult to follow. But it is there. Keep an eye<br/>
out for tree markers (yellow painted triangles that have been there for<br/>
20 or more years)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
16) At the halfway point there is new fork in the  path that was made<br/>
recently from the private lands side. This basically heads in a straight<br/>
line with the trail.  Do not follow this trail as it will not bring you<br/>
back to where you want to go. Instead bend to the left and follow the<br/>
trail straight down the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
17) You will be going through pine forest now. Some of the larger logs<br/>
have been cut out to open the path.<br/>
       Whoever did that - Thanks , not everyone carrys a chain saw with<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
18) This is where it is a little tricky. The trail bends to the left and<br/>
you have to crawl under some partially fallen pine trees. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
19) This path crosses a dry brook and heads back up at a 45 degree angle<br/>
in this pine forest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
20) When you get this far you will be at  "Sunset Seat" as it was called<br/>
in the old days! Today it's called <br/>
<br/>
        M _ G _ _      M _ _ D _ _          Where every 28 days the Moon <br/>
makes its appearance !<br/>
<br/>
       Indian head Mountain is to the east , Notice his forehead and<br/>
chin! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
21) Walk through this field, on the other side is McDaniels Road and from<br/>
there 200 yards  where you began!</div>
