<br/>
We're planning to come down to Mansfield and Coventry<br/>
over the next few weeks, while I've got some weekends<br/>
off. We're going to Coventry and Andover tomorrow<br/>
(been there once last year, going back to get all the<br/>
new ones since then), and planning to go to Mansfield<br/>
next weekend. <br/>
<br/>
Can any of you folks in Mansfield give us a hand<br/>
planning our day? There are so many clues for<br/>
Mansfield, I'd hate to go somewhere and discover at<br/>
home that night that we missed another box that was<br/>
just a couple of feet away from where we'd been. <br/>
