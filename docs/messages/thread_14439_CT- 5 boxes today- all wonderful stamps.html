                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today we did J.Drew's 3 box series "Their Finest Hour".  Great <br/>
carvings(but of course!!) and found all 3 no problem.  Then went to <br/>
do the Reservoir Walk which is at Pattaconk State Park in Chester.  I <br/>
grew up near there, and spent MANY days swimming and picnicing there <br/>
during summer vacations as a kid.  It was like a walk down memory <br/>
lane for me.  Both boxes were in great shape, and I love the stamps--<br/>
 "great job" to the placers, and Thanks to all who place boxes.- <br/>
Sunshine+Swamp Yankee+ Toad Dog,too!!<br/>
