got stuck trying to complete the task for stamp #3 in the Moo-Mahh <br/>
virtual series because the required search at WebShots no longer <br/>
yielded the indicated results.  I tried uploading a few photos of my <br/>
own on the subject to my WebShots account, including the indicated <br/>
keywords, but they never got indexed (apparently they have too many <br/>
photos and are not able to index all of them).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway while I was trying to figure out how to change the clues to <br/>
allow a person to get past this, the situation fixed itself and the <br/>
clues once again work as they were written.<br/>
<br/>
So if you gave up because you weren't getting anywhere on #3, please <br/>
try again.<br/>
