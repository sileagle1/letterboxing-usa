I love the change too!<br/>
<br/>
As long as we're offering our two cents, how about green flags for<br/>
boxes whose status is "OK", yellow flags for "Repair", and red for<br/>
"Missing" or "Retired"?<br/>
<br/>
Also, it would be nice to be able to return directly to the "area"<br/>
listings rather than the clue page once we've submitted a change in<br/>
"found", "attempted", etc.  Right now you go from America map, to<br/>
state map, to area listings, to clue, to status page, then back to the<br/>
clue page, but then if you hit "back" you go back to the status page<br/>
rather than back to the area listing which is minorly annoying.  There<br/>
is no way to get back to the area listings other than starting the<br/>
whole process over again.  I know one can compensate in other ways,<br/>
but just something to consider.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your work!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I like those ideas also.  I have just started posting the boxes I have found and several that I went searching for seemed to be missing.  I did write to the placers, to see if they know if the boxes are still there or not....as we know our areas pretty well and are pretty sure that we were in the right places.  So it would be nice to have some sort of "flagging system"  for missing or damaged boxes, like the green flags are working for the found boxes.  Also, since I am still new to this....there used to be a lot more boxes in our area that were listed, and now seem to have been removed, and we found them a while back ago and some of them are still in place....is there a way to have your found count show past boxes?  Perhaps there could be a page of retired/missing boxes that used to be available, so that people that found them in the past could still list them as finds, and they would not be listed on the same pages with clues that would send people out hunting for them?  It is very disappointing to chase after four kids to the next box only to discover that it is missing....if there was a yellow or red flag alert for the box on the site, boxers would know either not to go to that one until it was repaired/replaced.....or might offer to help the placer figure out what is needed for it if it is one placed near their stomping grounds.  Boxers that live in the area, or visit an area, could email the placer and help set things right, would that be a good suggestion?<br/>
I really like the yellow and red flag alert idea also, just wanted you to know!<br/>
<br/>
And Dragon is right about the pages linking back, that is a bit frustrating, but I understand how those things go, having just started building my own site,....it helps to hear the input here!<br/>
