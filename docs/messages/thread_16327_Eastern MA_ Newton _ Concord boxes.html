The directions for the trail were a bit confusing. We never did find a Y junction. We also found the Battle Road Trail box. We replaced the ziploc bag for the ink pad and stamp. The log book is almost full. One page left. It was a beautiful day with lots of lovely foliage. The colors are just vibrant!<br/>
