my experiance at having done just that, it should not be an expected <br/>
part of letterboxing. It took me a month to finally get it to work <br/>
and to convert all my letterboxes from "word" to "html". If your a <br/>
novice like me and wish to try it, I'll pass along a few tips I <br/>
learned. I had windows 98 on my computer, but only office 95, which I <br/>
learned does'nt let you save a "word" document as "html" (web form). <br/>
So first I had to upgrade to office 97, which does have this feature. <br/>
Second, a program called Frontpage, really helps you in creating a <br/>
web page. Again, I had Frontpage 98, which was so-so. Then my sister <br/>
gave me Frontpage 2002 and I saw the light. Very clear and consise. <br/>
The book Frontpage for dummies also helped alot. Another thing that <br/>
helped was that my internet provider (SBC/SNET) gave me a free web <br/>
page. This was my biggest incentive. I did enjoy creating my own web <br/>
page and would say give it a try if you've been thinking about it. <br/>
Check out the Web Ring on the bottom of the Lbna home page. Some <br/>
pretty amazing personal web pages. Please ignore my spelling errors, <br/>
no spellcheck. <br/>
