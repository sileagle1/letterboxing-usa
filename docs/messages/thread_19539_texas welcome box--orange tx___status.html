Thanks for the update on the box.<br/>
As for the question, I am not really sure. I do know there are gators there<br/>
from time to time, but I suspect that the cats are just throw outs. lol.  I<br/>
suppose the staff feeds them. Maybe the cats are waiting for the gators LOL.<br/>
I have noticed that the spiders have been bad this year. A couple of times I<br/>
have hesitated to enter the woods because of them .<br/>
Thanks again for the update,<br/>
DrooP<br/>
