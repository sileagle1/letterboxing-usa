It's our first trip to CA and we're looking forward to<br/>
exploring.  We plan on placing a box in Topanga State<br/>
Park while we're out there.  It doesn't look like<br/>
there are any boxes there yet.  Does anyone familiar<br/>
with the area have a "don't miss" box we should try<br/>
for?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.<br/>

schedule. Bolsa Chica "Shore Bird" along with Wendy Gault's "Pelican" ,"El<br/>

CSULB,Signal Hill, "White by day" ,West wetlands  can all be found at night<br/>
in fact they might be better at night. We were at the Squirrels about a year<br/>
ago. Make sure you include  Enchanted Palos Verdes as it has a super stamp.<br/>
