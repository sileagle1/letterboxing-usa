    Thanks so much for this great series.  I was quite shocked to <br/>
see no one had been to the first box since August!  Was the park <br/>
closed or something?  I found all six boxes plus the other three <br/>
in Haley.  I did have to hurry a bit as I didn't start until noon.<br/>
    Boxes 2 &amp; 5 of Sound View were wet but no damage to the <br/>
logs.  I used my own ink pad for those two as yours were a bit <br/>
waterlogged.  Only #5 had visitors since the summer and those <br/>
people just stumbled onto the box.  The foundation is getting <br/>
quite a bit of briar but that is up to the State.  The area around #6 <br/>
is turning into a maze of bike trails.  I really needed the compass <br/>
to figure out which ones to take.<br/>
    There looked to be enough clue sheets, especially with one <br/>
boxer every six months...  How about a box 4a or 5a to break up <br/>
the railroad stretch?  There is a really nice loop to a bench at the <br/>
very top of the cove.  It gets you out of the industrial zone for a <br/>
while.  <br/>
    I tried to find the Hex box on the way home but gave up after <br/>
nearly falling off the cliff in the dark.<br/>
    You are the DrewClanMan for all your work in the sport.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
WaldenRun (Geoff)<br/>
