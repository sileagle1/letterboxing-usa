kind and helpful. Thanks again Pepes for the New l.b. bul. board.  I <br/>
remain confident the diatribes here won't carry over to that safe <br/>
haven. Think I'll go check right now just to reassure myself.<br/>
 So let's turn to more pleasant neutral topics while waiting for <br/>
letterboxing to be the top topic here at the letterboxing bulleton <br/>
board...-- How 'bout them Red Sox? ((ducking for cover as the Yankee <br/>
fans take aim)) <br/>

or an RBI, and I'm not kidding!! but is  definitely looking foward to <br/>
seeking out some N.H. boxes this weekend.<br/>
