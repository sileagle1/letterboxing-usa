<br/>
I have been out doing kayaking and ultralight hiking.  Because many of<br/>
my letterboxes in Ohio have gone missing, I have completed an overhaul<br/>
of many of my clue sets.  Where I know a box is missing, I have marked<br/>
it so.  This is reflected on my Flyfisher Index and in ach box. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the several of you who have looked unsuccessfully for boxes<br/>
that were not there.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone would like to check with me before going out to one of my<br/>
older boxes about any news I have received, I would be glad to respond. <br/>
<br/>
Boxes are mostly in SW Ohio.  They include:<br/>
<br/>
Beavercreek Island<br/>
Carriage Hill<br/>
Cave Frogs<br/>
Cliffs of Insanity<br/>
Genesis<br/>
Lost Fishie<br/>
Mad Brown Trout<br/>
Mad Mad World<br/>
Massies Creek<br/>
Hooked on Phonics<br/>
Proto Cave Frogs<br/>
Proto Tree Frogs<br/>
Rediscovery<br/>
Rivendel<br/>
Tree Frogs<br/>
Udder Maddness<br/>
<br/>
Dunn River Falls (Jamaica)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the kind emails I receive on the boxes from time to<br/>
time.  I admit that I will not be getting out to most of these boxes<br/>
for some time.  It would be nie to bring an new log book to many of<br/>
those still out there.<br/>

I thoroughly enjoyed looking for some of your boxes over the weekend<br/>
while visiting family in Springfield.  I found Udder Madness, Horace<br/>
Mann, and Vines.  The other box that is hidden in the wall of the barn<br/>
ruins (2 ft. above the rusted stake) on Swimming Pool Access Road is<br/>
missing, but the other (under the 3 bricks) is alive and well.  I had<br/>
family with me while looking - they didn't understand how I could love<br/>
such a hobby until they were there when I uncovered the boxes.  I wish I<br/>
had more time to fine the others in John Bryan Park.  Keep up the great<br/>
boxes!<br/>
