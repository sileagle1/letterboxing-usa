<br/>
Got back home from our second gathering last night after midnight!  What a great weekend it was!<br/>
<br/>
Jay, you picked a beautiful spot for us all to meet.  It was a pleasure to reconnect w/ letterboxers (Tom, Rae, Jerry, Fred (for the 1st time)) as well as meet the CT/EMS connection (Jay, Ned, Ariel, Sarah, Terri, Bob, Judy, Abbie) and, perhaps most importantly, convert my wife and the boys.  Residents of CT &amp; surrounding states are very lucky that the hobby has caught on as rapidly as it has (Now if we could get Jay et al. to travel around the country a little more...).  We found a nice variety of boxes (short hikes appropriate for small kids, and longer ones in beatiful surroundings).<br/>
<br/>
These weekends are truly special, and I look forward to the day that they may be held anywhere in the country!  We just need to figure out how to get the word out better, and get the boxes out there.  I wish you could all have been there around the campfire and out on the trails.  As I had had the opportunity to do at the 1st Gathering (VT) with Kim &amp; Royce, I had the joy of searching for some boxes with another boxer (other than my family). I can enrich the experience.<br/>
<br/>
So, my heartfelt thanks to Jay &amp; his clan for all they've done for letterboxing, to the EMS crew for starting it all up there and sharing their clues with us, and to every one else on the list for your contributions in your own way.   The future looks bright!<br/>
<br/>
Randy, Kim, Royce, we missed you. Actually we missed all those on the list who couldn't be there.  See you <br/>

John summed up our week-end gathering very nicely. It was great to <br/>
see again those letterboxers we had already met, and equally <br/>
wonderful to meet new ones. Thanks for the surprise, Rae &amp; Jerry. <br/>
Sorry not to see you, Kim and Royce - next time.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't sunny on Saturday, but the rain came before 9 am and after <br/>
11 pm, and didn't interfere with the hunt. Although I love the woods, <br/>
it has been a special treat the two times I've been letterboxing in <br/>
CT/RI to walk along the ocean or the ocean bluff.<br/>
<br/>
As John said, it was really nice to participate in a hunt with some <br/>
other devotees; usually letterboxing is a solitary affair.<br/>
<br/>
I think the campfire Saturday night was the high point. It was great <br/>
to Sarah &amp; Terri and Bob &amp; Judy. You all at EMS have done so much to <br/>
promote our hobby in the northeast.<br/>
<br/>
And Jay, thank you especially for all that you have done and for <br/>
setting up this week-end for us!<br/>

Where and when is the next??<br/>

family death finally settled the issue clearly. Anyways, I,m gladdened<br/>
by the reporots from all as to its success. WE'll make it next time!<br/>

By the way, for benefit of future travellers trying to connect? Perhaps<br/>
an "LBNA" window decal is not such a bad idea?<br/>

We are glad you can make it...just introduce yourself and once you are <br/>
recognized as a newbie and converged upon for an exchange you will wish you <br/>
had kept to yourself. You have heard the old saying Letterboxers will do <br/>
anything for a new stamp.....and I do mean ANYTHING!!<br/>

We (MommaFox &amp; Bald Eagle) along with the Maplines are planning a gathering on Sunday, May 2, 2004.  Yes, on a Sunday!  So mark your calendars.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunatley none of us can usually make a Saturday gathering because of work so we thought a Sunday one would be good!  We'll keep you updated on the plans.  Any suggestions, do's &amp; don'ts would be appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for all the great comments regarding another CT event....Most people feel that the focus should be on planning something for over the winter.  That is fine with me.  Initially when I mentioned the idea I was mostly inquiring about Kid's Day, but then got sort of swept away by the idea of putting something else together, but I certainly would rather attend a well planned event then something thrown together.<br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward hearing more about the CT Icebreaker as well as the May Event, posted today.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone who posted opinions.  Of course, the fact that there will not be a formal event should not discourage anyone who was interested from boxing at Rocky Neck State Park in early November, although chilly, it is a beautiful park.<br/>
