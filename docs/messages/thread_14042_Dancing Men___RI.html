                    <div class="plaintext-content">    Well, after a day of work on the 4th of July, explaining <br/>
letterboxing and what it is and passing around the "Dancing Men" <br/>
cryptogram to several people, we have it figured out!  Everyone was <br/>
so into it!  After another day of work today (mandatory overtime!) <br/>
asking about a place mentioned in the clues..we are off tomorrow <br/>
morning to find it.  We still aren't quite sure if it's the right <br/>
area, but we hope it is.  Everything seems to point there.  We'll <br/>
see what we find...Thanks to Rich, Dave, Scott, Randy, Bill, Rob, <br/>
Al, Mort who got involved and gave ideas, stories "it has to be <br/>
here!!!", knowledge, etc.  It made the 12 hours on Friday fly by as <br/>
we figured it out!! Maybe a converted a few people as well?  We'll <br/>
see......<br/>
