I also want to thank the webmasters for spending so much of their free<br/>
time keeping letterboxing.org up and running.  Without them boxing<br/>
would still be in the stone age in our country.  I think a lot of<br/>
folks just don't realize the amount of work involved in maintaining a<br/>
website, especially one that size...and it is Big.  So, thank you<br/>
webmeisters of LbNA for keeping the well maintained and easily<br/>
accessible center of clues.  You guys are doing a great job.<br/>

&gt; I think that we all too often lose sight of what letterboxing is<br/>
about, at the end of the day it is all about being out on the trail,<br/>
or moor, or wherever you prefer to box and having fun.  Its not an<br/>
olympic sport....yet.......and neither do we get paid for it, our<br/>
reward, as stated by alwayschaos, is something which many people in<br/>
this world live without.........the freedom to just go out and do it<br/>
when we feel like it.  Letterboxing is all about being outside, not<br/>
sitting at a computer talking about it or trying to figure out the<br/>
meaning of life.  Sometimes we take ourselves to seriousley.  You are<br/>
very lucky to have a group like this, we in the UK have very little<br/>
apart from some very good personal sites and a well put together MSN<br/>
group, but talk between us brits is limited (which i feel is a poor<br/>
show considering that this is the home of boxing).  Testamony to this<br/>
lies in the 2 days i spent with the Bakers Dozen, the most fun I've<br/>
had letterboxing to date! and thats what it is<br/>
&gt;  all about.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; It is a sad fact that there are those that are malicious enough to<br/>
destroy someones hard work (website) and I offer my support to the<br/>
site managers, but sadly this behaviour is just human nature, it<br/>
happens to letterboxing on a daily basis - boxes go missing, people<br/>
steal stamps and yet we simply replace them and carry on, its all we<br/>
can do, and no amount of finger pointing or swearing will change that.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; My opinion may upset some, and for that i apologise in advance, but<br/>
lets not forget the essence of letterboxing !<br/>
