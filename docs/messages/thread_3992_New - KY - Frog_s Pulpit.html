This letterbox is a modified microletterbox with stamp, stamp pad, <br/>
and log book contained in two 35mm film containers.  The log is only <br/>
1.5 inches wide, so don't expect a large stamp to fit.  Bring a small <br/>
cousin.<br/>
<br/>
With the stream gurgling or babbling (depending on one's proficiency <br/>
with ancient tongues) nearby, the frog's bully pulpit is filled on <br/>
quiet spring evenings with either local talent or with the bass notes <br/>
of circuit riding bullfrogs.  The choir of cicadas breaks in to <br/>
enthrall the congregation, and the message is deeply infused in the <br/>
listener.  <br/>
<br/>
Far from the Valley of Frogs, pioneers sent out by the ancient order <br/>
have settled this little glade.  Their northern cousins would be <br/>
happy to know their Kentucky cousins are prospering, growing, <br/>
learning, and making lots of little froggies!<br/>
