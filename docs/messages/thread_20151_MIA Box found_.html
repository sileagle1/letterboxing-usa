Just wanted to give hope to anyone who has ever had a box go MIA. Early in <br/>
July I planted a box called Weeping Willow in Bird Park in Walpole MA. Shortly <br/>
thereafter I got an email from someone who had tried to find it, and couldn't. <br/>
They thought they had seen some kids playing near the bridge where it was <br/>
hidden. I went to look the next day and sure enough it was in fact missing. <br/>
Bummer! I recarved the stamp, remade a box, found a new spot, and revised the clues. <br/>
Now at the end of August I got an email from the contact the placer link from <br/>
one of park manager saying he had my box, it had been under a bench, not <br/>
where it was supposed to be hidden, and that I could meet him to get the box. Well <br/>
that night I checked on the replaceement Willow box, and sure enough it was <br/>
still there. The original Willow box had been found! You never can tell!<br/>

a couple of boxes.  Most recently it happened to a box that we'd <br/>
checked on three times over the course of several months and all <br/>
three times we verified it was indeed missing (it's one of those <br/>
places we visit regularly).  We went back with a replacement <br/>
letterbox on the 4th visit and were stunned to find the original <br/>
letterbox about 4' away from its original location.  We'd scoured <br/>
this area already looking for any remnants of the missing box the <br/>
three previous visits (our attempt to salvage the stamp).  Who knows <br/>
what happened those times it was missing???  There wasn't a soul <br/>
around each time we'd visited it before hand.  My only guess is that <br/>
there's a geocache nearby hidden in a similar manner as a handful of <br/>
geocachers have also signed into the log and perhaps they found it <br/>
thinking it was their cache and hid it closer to where the GPS <br/>
coordinates say the cache should be?  It's a stretch but that's all <br/>
I can think of...  <br/>

I carved another stamp and replaced the box.<br/>
<br/>
This summer, the entire contents of the first box (including a HH) <br/>
plus the new box were found all together in an oversize plastic bag, <br/>
hidden together in the correct location. No note or explanation<br/>
<br/>
Most of the pages of the first logbook were vandalized, but I'm still <br/>
left wondering, "what the heck?" about this situation. I guess the <br/>
best response is to take any blessing that comes your way.<br/>

Enjoy!<br/>
