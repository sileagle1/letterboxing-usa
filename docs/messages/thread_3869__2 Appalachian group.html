Great Smoky Mtn. Nat. Park,  Go to the Visitors Center.  Get directions<br/>
to the Larual Falls Trail.  There is a small parking lot.  The trail is<br/>
uphill all the way.  It is 1.3 miles to the Falls.  Your prize is about<br/>
100 / 120 yards beyond the Falls  foot bridge.  You will come upon<br/>
acouple of very large tree (30" dia.) on the left side. Across from the<br/>
tree on the right side is a large tree that has fallen and was cut off<br/>
at trail edge, a large rock sits to the right of the tree.  Up the hill,<br/>
steep, at the base of the fallen tree is what probably was the tree<br/>
trunk, split open when the tree fell.  The trunk is hollow, with an<br/>
opening on the right side, inside the opening, to the left, under leaves<br/>
is you prize.<br/>
This was a hard climb, even to this spot, for this 'old' man.<br/>

....and keep heading up the mountain for a while and you may find my <br/>
Laurel Falls box as well! I will be going up there over Christmas and <br/>
hope to find your box and check on the status of mine. Thanks much <br/>
for giving me another reason for heading up this great trail again!<br/>
