list generates a lot of email - particularly if you get each <br/>
individual email that comes through.<br/>
<br/>
For some, this is not a problem and would be their preference.  For <br/>
others, this is a LOT of email traffic.  Routinely, I go into the <br/>
members list and "reset" the members that are bouncing due to email <br/>
boxes over their quota for messages.  <br/>
<br/>
Is this you?  If so - you can fix the problem and still get all the <br/>
messages from the list by changing your delivery options to "daily <br/>
digest".  This will give you ONE email, containing up to 25 messages <br/>
from the board.  Sometimes there will be more than one digest per <br/>
day, sometimes not.  <br/>
<br/>
In order to change your settings - visit the web:<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa<br/>
<br/>
In the upper right hand corner - click "edit my membership" and this <br/>
is where you can change your delivery options.  Another delivery <br/>
choice is "no mail" where you have to visit the website in order to <br/>
read the messages at your leisure.<br/>
<br/>
Just sending this message in the hopes that it will help someone out <br/>
there.  :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Don't forget other options.  I started on the daily digest, but found <br/>
it cumbersome to respond to emails when I had to cut and past <br/>
so much and remember the names of subjects.  I liked the ease <br/>
of responding to individual messages without having to clear out <br/>
tons of other emails.<br/>
<br/>
When I was receiving individual emails, I'm one of the ones who <br/>
struggled with my box filling up if I couldn't get to it every day or <br/>
several times a day if there was a virulent flame on.  I still didn't <br/>
consider the option of just reading online because it felt like I <br/>
was leaving the list to not receive mail.<br/>
<br/>
I avoided this till I was going out of the country for two weeks and <br/>
had no idea what my internet access would be, so I switched to <br/>
only receiving important messages from the webmasters.  I have <br/>
loved it since.  I still read all the messages I want.  I can respond <br/>
to individual emails easily, and I don't have to worry about <br/>
deleting hundreds of emails at a time.  More importantly, I'm not <br/>
losing emails from friends or business associates who's mail <br/>
gets bounced back to them.  If there is an email I find especially <br/>
pertinent on the list that I want to keep, I simply forward it to <br/>
myself.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought, but it has helped my mailbox a lot.<br/>
