<body><b>Camelot Series:</b>
<br/><b>#4 The Black Knight</b>
<br/><b>#5 Guinevere</b><b></b>
<p>A pair of letterboxes on a traprock ridge with breathtaking views on
the popular Mattabassett Trail over Mt Higby on the Middletown/Meriden
border (Middlesex &amp; New Haven Counties).
<br/>Difficulty: quite strenuous inclines and ridgeline scrambling. This
hike covers about 4 miles in 3.5 hours.
</p><p>Directions: At the western end of CT Rte. 66, just before it merged
into I-691 (and just west of Guida's Diner at Rte. 147), watch for a roadside
pullout and blue blazes on the northern side of the highway. Alternatively,
there is parking at Guida's and a pink-dot-on-blue blazed connector trail
heading west from the diner, which parallels the road for about 1/2 a mile.
</p><p>Follow the blue blazed trail from the road as it turns left away from
the unblazed shortcut trail. Questers may wish to visit Lady <i>Barb &amp;</i>
Lord <i>Larry's Ledge</i> on the way to challenge the Black Knight. Continue
along the ridgeline and stay on the Mattabassett as it drops into Preston
Notch. There is the remains of a carriage road through the notch, and the
town line also passes through here. Keep faithful to the trail as it climbs
again to spectacular views, and rest at the Natural Bridge, for your challenger
is near. Standing in front of the bridge, walk 13 paces at 140 degrees.
Look down to the right to find the Black Knight aiming his lance at your
heart, for "None shall pass!"
</p><p>Retrace your steps, only take the shortcut trail, which goes left before
reaching the Mt. Higby letterbox. Don't be strayed by the gravel-paved
road which leads far off toward the reservoirs (though it also connects
to the old carriage road in Preston Notch too).Â  Along this trail,
keep an eye out for an erratic on the right, you can tell when you get
there because the path will become bedrock. There are many places to sit
and rest on this split erratic, a hospitable place to find the Queen of
Briton. Look for a single rock covering our Lady's resting place in a crevice
on the northeast side of the boulder.
