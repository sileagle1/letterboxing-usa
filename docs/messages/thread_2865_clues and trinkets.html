boxes had prizes in them all wrapped and obviously a little gift. One <br/>
event box had a jigsaw puzzle as the clues. that one drove a few <br/>
crazy as they were bundled up for New England  in January and they <br/>
had to put it togehter to see where to go. I plan to use this idea <br/>
again. <br/>
Recently recieved a postcard from a box visited by an English lady <br/>
who left a couple pennies and tuppence for the next seeker, what a <br/>
thrill that would be to find. My Opening Day box commemorated fishing <br/>
season and there was a nice set of worms for the first finder. ( <br/>
Plastic) We can never tire of this sport or hobby as the <br/>
possibilities are endless and the little suprise now and then drives <br/>
us on to the next one.  Here -  Here to diviersity we  have it and <br/>
use it!<br/>
 I personnaly love the camera idea and think I will try that. I know <br/>
just the box that should have one for the summer. I don't think a <br/>
camera would fare very well in the woods in the winter. <br/>
