Find the area of really big boulders.<br/>
Take hike #1.<br/>
The hikes destination namesake faces 3 large clusters of rocks.<br/>
The largest is to the right, (N), head towards this rock cluster.</div>

<h1>San Bernardino, California<br/></h1>This box was placed 2/24/01 <br/>This letterbox is inside Joshua Tree 
  National Monument in San Bernardino/Riverside County, California. There is a 
  small fee, but if you have never seen this area, it is a wonderful place to 
  spend some time, or even to camp for a couple of days. <br/>Find the area of 
  really big boulders. <br/>Take hike #1. <br/>The hikes destination namesake 
  faces 3 large clusters of rocks. <br/>The largest is to the right, (N), head 
  towards this rock cluster. <br/>From the namesake, it is a short 10-15 minute 
  hike across washes &amp; over boulders. There is no definite trail, but it's 
  easy to negotiate. <br/>As you approach this large cluster of rocks, you will 
  see a darker huge sharks-fin/houndstooth rock in front of the large cluster, 
  head towards this. <br/>As you get closer to the sharks-fin, you will notice a 
  table-top/square rock below the sharks fin, this is your destination. <br/>Once 
  again, there is no obvious trail that leads up here, so you can go any way you 
  like, but an easy way to get there is to follow the Southeast face of the 
  original large rock cluster back towards the sharksfin &amp; tabletop, you 
  have to go around some bushes, but there is a rough trail. <br/>Standing in the 
  tunnel under tabletop, at the east end, you will see a knee-hi small clump of 
  bushes. <br/>With your hand or a stick, spread the bushes away from the boulder 
  &amp; look along the ground next to the boulder. (Always being careful of 
  critters, snakes &amp; such) There will be a small container with a blueish 
  lid. <br/>If you stand up here, you should just be able to see the namesake. 
  <br/>Now you hikers can go explore the other areas of the park. <br/>Have fun.
