<br/>
In and around Stone Mountain State Park in Wilkes County, North Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
	Caudill Cabin<br/>
	Placed 11/11/01<br/>
<br/>
	From Wildcat Rocks overlook at Doughton Park look Southeast at 	130<br/>
degrees and about 1000 feet straight down to a small cabin.  If 	you<br/>
can fly,  take ten steps forward.<br/>
<br/>
	The preferred method  is to enter Doughton park at the juncture of<br/>
Long Bottom Rd and Basin Creek at the southern end of the park.  	From<br/>
there hike approximately 5 miles up stream following the 	signs to the<br/>
cabin.  This is a beautiful hike along a continuously 	cascading stream,<br/>
broken only by the occasional waterfall and 	deep, fish filled crystal<br/>
clear pool.  Towering above are massive 	Hemlocks, White Pines, Oaks<br/>
and Poplars. The scenery is so nice 	that we made it easy to find the<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
	Once at the cabin's front door, look 250 degrees to a large boulder<br/>
between the juncture of two forks of Basin Creek about 75 paces as 	the<br/>
crow flys. Look under the back side of the boulder.    <br/>
