<p align="center">The Honey Bucket</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">(Granby, Connecticut)</p></b>
<p>Location: McLean’s Game Refuge</p>
<p>Granby, CT</p>
<p>Number of boxes: 3</p>
<p>Clues: Easy</p>
<p>Length: 2.5 mile loop</p>
<p>Hidden: 10/5/02 by The Grandbees</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Directions: From Rt. 91 take the Rt. 20 exit toward Bradley Field. Continue 
to the intersection of route 10/ 202 and route 20 in the center of Granby, CT. 
Go west on route 20 toward Hartland. Continue for 1.3 miles and then go left on 
Barn Door Hills Road. Continue on Barn Door Hills Road passing between the two 
adjacent rock formations for which the road is named. At 2.1 miles you will come 
to Haven Drive on the right, continue 100 yards and park along the side of the 
road opposite the wooden gate that provides entrance to the Refuge. Please read 
the sign at the entrance and abide with the simple rules for preserving the 
area.</p><b>
</b><p>The Honey Bucket</p>
<p>Pooh Bear overheard the conversation when farmer Brown told Elsie the cow 
about a honey bucket in the woods near the Barn Door Hills. As we all know, 
bears love honey so Pooh Bear set out to find the honey based on what was 
overheard. Follow the clues and see if you can find Pooh’s surprise. Pooh would 
appreciate a short note at each box with your stamp to document your experience 
on the trails.</p>
<p>Start at the wooden gate and follow the old logging road as it winds around 
the corn field on your left. When you arrive at the end of the field, after 
about 15 paces, a trail will cross the logging road marked with purple paint 
marks about eye height. Take a left on the purple trail and after ten paces, go 
right on the trail marked with dark blue blazes. Continue on this trail 
following the dark blue blazes through a pine forest. Enjoy the serenity of tall 
towering pines and note all the fallen trees which have toppled in the same 
direction indicating a very strong wind had passed through this area at some 
point in time. More on this later. To find the first box be on the lookout for 
an oak tree with a triple trunk right next to the trail. It has a fallen tree 
wedged between the trunks. The root end of the fallen tree is o the opposite 
side of the trail and the first box is located at the base. Tree bark is used to 
cover this and all of the other boxes. Stamp in and then continue on the dark 
blue trail. </p>
<p>You will have a short steep climb that will bring you back onto the logging 
road. Go left on the logging road and be on the lookout for a large oak tree 
with a light blue paint mark at eye level on the left side of the trail. (If you 
go down a steep hill with a wooden bridge crossing a stream, you have gone past 
it. Go back up the hill and look again.) Take a left of the logging road and 
follow the light blue trail down the hill toward the Spring Pond. At the bottom 
of the hill note all the large fallen trees all uprooted and felled in the same 
direction. More evidence of a severe wind that must have been near tornado force 
to cause these trees to topple. Continue to follow the trail as it boarders the 
pond. In the summer, turtles like to sit in the sun on the trees that have 
fallen into the water. About midway along the pond look, for a tree that leans 
from the left out over the trail and forming a high arch. A very large was 
snapped of near the base and fallen toward the trail. Walk to the point where it 
had been cut off to allow passage on the trail. The box can be found under the 
tree on the right side about two feet from the sawed end. Stamp in and proceed 
along the trail.</p>
<p>At the head of the pond the trail makes a circle in front of a log cabin 
shelter. If you follow the circle clockwise, you will find a tree with the light 
blue paint mark about 1/3 the way around the loop. The trail proceeds up a hill, 
but first, this is a beautiful place to stop and enjoy a picnic lunch, explore 
the log cabin shelter and take a rest on the bench at the far end of the earthen 
dam. A great spot for bird watching. After your break, proceed on the light blue 
trail. This will be a moderate climb up a slope but Pooh Bear must have run up 
this hill knowing that the honey must be near. Soon after the hill levels out, 
be on the lookout for the intersection of the purple trail which crosses the 
light blue. (If you come to an open field, you went past it.) Go right on the 
purple trail which runs parallel to a field on your left. Shortly, you will find 
a rusted piece of farm machinery with metal wheels about 15 paces off the left 
side of the trail abandoned by farmer Browns grandfather who jokingly called it 
the “Honey Bucket”. Can you guess what it was used for?? The third box has the 
answer . With your back to the right large wheel, walk 5 paces to the cluster of 
small fallen trees . Follow the trunks from the larger end for 4 paces. The box 
can be found on the far side of the trunks. Stamp in.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to complete the loop by back tracking on the purple trail. You 
will cross the light blue trail and continue on the purple. You will be 
traveling parallel to the large corn field where you first started out and will 
come to the logging road you traveled at the start of the search. Go right on 
the logging road back to the start point. It’s about a 20 minute walk back to 
the car.</p></div></body></html>
