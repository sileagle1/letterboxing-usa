<br/>
John and I impulsively took a late afternoon drive over to SE Portland<br/>
and found the Crystal Springs Letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
Crystal Springs Gardens is such a beautiful and amazing place.  I had<br/>
never been there before.  So many beautiful plants and trees.  It smells<br/>
so good there.  A huge abundance of waterfowl, as well.  A romantic<br/>
place to be at dusk, as well.  <br/>
<br/>
The letterbox is doing fine.  Seemed a bit soggy and some of the<br/>
stamp-ins were a bit faded.  We enclosed it in an additional ziplock and<br/>
hope that helps.  Looks like lots of non-letterboxers have found it,<br/>
too.  We very much enjoyed finding this letterbox.  Thanks to Funhog for<br/>
placing!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
