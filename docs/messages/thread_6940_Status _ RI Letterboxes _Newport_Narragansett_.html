                    <div class="plaintext-content">As far as I know, the fast passage ones are still out and in good<br/>
shape.  They are also pretty easy.  Land Sail and the Cliff walk one<br/>
have eluded me to date, and I don't know their status.  The one out at<br/>
Sachueste (sp?) is also a good one, but the Pergutory Chasam one (also<br/>
listed as part of that "series" has been missing of some time.<br/>
<br/>
As for Narragansett/Jamestown area - Beavertail is a good one, as is<br/>
Fort Witherall.  The one out at Ft Getty is a bit on the difficult<br/>
side, but it is a nice place.  The one at Ft Adams is good, too - easy<br/>
but quite a walk.<br/>
<br/>
I am just doing this from the top of my head here - and have done these<br/>
all within the last 6 months or less and not heard of them going<br/>
missing.  If there are any specific ones you are looking at let me know<br/>
and I will tell you what I can ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting - sounds like it will be a great weekend!!<br/>

Midnight on the Moon and the *NEW* Point Judith are still there.  The <br/>
entire Harbor of Refuge series is gone (Galilee, Salty Brine, and <br/>
Jerusalem), just so you know.  Both are easy finds and fairly short <br/>
hikes.  The rewards of the locations are WELL worth the hunt.<br/>

<div>Two other nice boxes on the Narragansett side of 
the bay are Dolphins at Daybreak and Epilogue, both located on Rome Point.  
The starting point for them is less than a mile north of where you would turn 
off of Rt 1A (which runs from Pt. Judith past Black Point where Midnight on the 
Moon is located) onto Rt. 138 (which takes you over the bridges to Jamestown and 
Newport).  It's a few miles of hiking mostly through woods, but the view 
from the point is quite nice, and the peace and quiet of the area is pure bliss 
after being in the tourist-soaked madness of Narragansett.  My cousin and I 
recently spent 3 hours down there lazily letterboxing (it could be accomplished 
much faster than that, but why?), and only saw one other person.  
Amazing!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, for a quick box with a short but fairly steep 
climb she could try Viking Ship at Sunrise on Pettasquamscutt Rock in South 
Kingstown.  It's just off of Rt. 1A (before you get to Rt. 138), and has a 
very cool stamp.</div>

The Cliff Walk box was there a few months ago.  Be aware it is a long <br/>
walk with no shade, but the views are awesome.  <br/>

Fast Passage one at Castle Hill, but we'll do that one on our next trip <br/>
there.  Both were easy to find, but there was poison ivy near the Fort Adams <br/>
one and it was a steep climb that needed sturdier shoes than the sandals I <br/>
was wearing.  Good luck!<br/>
