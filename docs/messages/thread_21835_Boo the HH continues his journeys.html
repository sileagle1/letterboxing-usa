"After being scanned, x-rayed, decompressed, tossed around and finally <br/>
landing on a moving walkway, I was exposed to the warm rays of the sun <br/>
and started my tan." sighed little Boo as he finally began to feel the <br/>
warmth that had eluded him since November where he sat all winter, <br/>
frozen in the great lakes state's Celtic mounds. <br/>
<br/>
"Where am I?  I'm at a place where the bow man battled with Charley and <br/>
survived!"  Shouts little Boo as he listens to the call of the great <br/>
hunter Mr. P. H. Aliaetus.<br/>
