I am brand new to letterboxing.  I found your summer storms <br/>
letterbox, but it had been attacked by wild vicious beasts <br/>
(javelina??).  So we found some remains of the box (the notebook, the <br/>
box).  We were not able to find the stamp or lid though.  We replaced <br/>
the box and put your notebook in it, but there is no stamp.  I don't <br/>
know what to do in this situation.  Could you send out another stamp <br/>
to me and  I could put it in?  <br/>
