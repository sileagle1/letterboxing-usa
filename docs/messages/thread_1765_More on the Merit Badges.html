 4) P#-F# MERIT BADGES: Here's the kicker: we must have a minimum <br/>
 order of 50 merit badges - ALL OF THE SAME EXACT TYPE/DENOMINATION. <br/>
 There is *alot* of interest in the P/F merit badges as Mohmers' <br/>
 recent poll shows, but unfortunately, we are nowhere near 50 of any <br/>
 one type. Sorry, folks, but unfortunately those are the stipulations <br/>
 that Town Hall Embroidery has imposed on us. (And before you say it, <br/>
 yes, I KNOW they are not the only embroidery game in town.)<br/>
  &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Thanks Val for setting this up and for volunteering to "collect" for the 2nd <br/>
Batch of patches.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
  I wanted to note, for the record, that the P &amp; F denominations of 50 <br/>
minimum are set by the supplier (who is not Town Hall Embroidery).  Town Hall <br/>
is really the middle-man here.  Town Hall is not a huge operation.  They <br/>
have, probably, 8 computerized embroidery machines. which are mesmerizing to <br/>
watch.  I literally have to move my children out of the store by their <br/>
shoulders.  :o)  Their bulk order supplier has the capacity to make patches <br/>
at a low price but to maintain this cost requires a 50 patch minimum of any <br/>
patch variation.  Even something with simple variations like P to F.   The <br/>
thing is that a 50 minimum for a $2 patch is the best I have found.  It is <br/>
possible that a lower minimum exists but I haven't found it for the price.   <br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
 T.H.E. has put a price together for me so that people can make individual <br/>
orders however the cost would be $10 per patch with an initial $80 computer <br/>
set up fee ... the good point was that interchanging the P to F to X is no <br/>
big deal so an additional computer set up fee is not required.  Still, I just <br/>
couldn't justify the cost.  Especially since these are the type of patches <br/>
that would be embroidered on sweat shirt material and then need to be cut <br/>
apart  and/or trimmed.  That is the type of embroidery work that T.H.E. is <br/>
set up to do.  The quality would not be nearly as good.   T.H.E. has been <br/>
very patient with me since the first order turned out to be a several month <br/>
project just getting the interest together and collecting the orders.  I <br/>
waited for every last possible last minute order since I didn't know when we <br/>
would get enough interest together to make another one.  :o)    I was <br/>
pleasantly surprised to see the interest grow before the 1st order was even <br/>
sent out!  :o)<br/>
<br/>
   I am still hoping for a merit badge order.  I made a mistake, I think, on <br/>
the merit badge poll.  I think I should have asked for a count per patch.  My <br/>
suggestion would be to delete the first merit badge poll and submit another <br/>
one asking for the number per denomination.  I know for myself I would order <br/>
atleast 7 per denomination.  That would make a big difference if others had <br/>
plans to do the same.  If no one objects I think I will do that and see how <br/>
it goes.  If there is not enough interest then no harm is done.  :o)   I know <br/>
I felt bad having to return money to those ordering the merit badges in the <br/>
last order.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for another long post.<br/>

Happy Hunting,<br/>
