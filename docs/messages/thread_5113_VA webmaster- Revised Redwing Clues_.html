of the Garden Gnome.  Thanks a bunch!!  A.D.<br/>
<br/>
Redwing Park (2)<br/>
Virginia Beach, VA<br/>
TERRAIN: Easy; nice stroll among the gardens. <br/>
CLUE DIFFICULTY: Easy, good for the young and those practicing <br/>
orienteering skills.<br/>
PLANTED: March 9, 2002(replanted 4/22/02) by <br/>
the Drakes and their dog Buddy<br/>

<br/>
Redwing Park is located in Virginia Beach at 1398 General Booth <br/>
Boulevard, not far from the Oceanfront. These boxes are very near the <br/>
Flame of Hope stamp on Oceana Boulevard. After stamping in at the <br/>
Flame of Hope continue south on Oceana Boulevard until the major <br/>
intersection with General Booth Boulevard. Take a right onto General <br/>
Booth. Redwing Park is almost immediately on your left. If you miss <br/>
the turn, continue down to the intersection of General Booth and Dam <br/>
Neck Road. A U turn here will bring you back by the park. <br/>
<br/>
Bring a lunch to enjoy in the picnic area after stamping in. There is <br/>
a nice small playground for the kids to burn off extra energy as well <br/>
as a playground for your pooch, too! <br/>
Park in the first parking lot to your left as you enter the park. <br/>
You may wish to enjoy the Japanese and Rose gardens before beginning <br/>
your search. Cross the road and enter the Redwing Gardens. The Garden <br/>
Gnome eagerly awaits your arrival.<br/>
<br/>
The Garden Gnome<br/>
Start your search at the Redwing Gardens sign just inside the ivy <br/>
garlanded white fence. Before you lay four different paths. Which one <br/>
to take to visit with the Garden Gnome? Take the 1st paved trail <br/>
heading east. Stay on this trail for a little while until two bridges <br/>
come into sight. <br/>
<br/>
Under one bridge lives the evil troll. Some say the metal railings of <br/>
his bridge act as a lightning rod causing him to be hit many times <br/>
over the years by these terrifying bolts. This has surely caused a <br/>
bit of his insanity and outright meanness. He is not to be disturbed <br/>
at any cost as he most certainly is not a gracious host! Beware!<br/>
<br/>
Our kindly Gnome spends his time tending the gardens in Redwing Park. <br/>
He used to live under the other bridge. The wooden construction of <br/>
his home kept him safe from lightning storms, but he had a tendency <br/>
to sail away down the stream in his little Rubbermaid boat when it <br/>
rained. So, after a particularly long journey toward the open ocean <br/>
he decided to move.  To find his new home, take the gravel path <br/>
toward the metal bridge but don't go over it.  Follow the gravel <br/>
trail to the right as it leads you past a bench to a short stone <br/>
walkway.  At the end of this stone path you will find a large pine <br/>
tree on your left with a rock at its base.  Lift the rock to find the <br/>
Garden Gnome's new home.  Stamp in and hide carefully, making sure to <br/>
be careful, as there are many who visit the park.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Redwing Park<br/>
Once you have stamped in move toward the center of the wooden bridge. <br/>
Facing the troll's bridge, look at your stamped image. The Garden <br/>
Gnome points the way to your next find! (Or, standing in the center <br/>
of the bridge, take a bearing of 260 degrees).<br/>
<br/>
Continue on your journey by following the paved path to your left. <br/>
The Garden Gnome would like you to enjoy the many flowering bushes <br/>
and trees as you go. Soon you will come upon a stone-encased water <br/>
fountain/bubbler on your right. Continue this path to the Fragrance <br/>
Gardens. The Fragrance Gardens were planted especially for the blind <br/>
to enjoy but we're sure you will enjoy the beautiful smells, too. <br/>
Take a moment to smell the Dwarf Gardenia, the Pitosporum, the Lilac <br/>
and the Anise bushes. Find the Ligustrum bush and take a bearing of <br/>
32 degrees to the paved path. Follow the paved path bearing to the <br/>
left as it meanders around the topiary. Before reaching the covered <br/>
wishing well you will see a gravel path to your right. Take the <br/>
gravel path. Shortly you must decide which path to choose.<br/>
At the intersection of many paths take a bearing of 100 degrees. 20 <br/>
paces ahead you will find the Mrs. C.L. Hershberger crepe myrtle <br/>
memorial tree. From here locate the "U" shaped tree. At the "U" <br/>
shaped tree follow the gravel path to the right until it connects <br/>
again with the paved path. Take a left onto this path. Continue on, <br/>
bearing left to your second gravel path on the left. Nestled within <br/>
the trees here (bearing 350 degrees) is a bench to take a rest. While <br/>
sitting on the bench locate the pair of trees growing together <br/>
to your left. You'll find the Redwing Park stamp hidden under the <br/>
pine needles in a small cubby at the base of the tree nearest to the <br/>
bench. Stamp in and rehide well. <br/>
Enjoy! :o)<br/>
