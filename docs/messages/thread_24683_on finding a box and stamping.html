                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, you stamp YOUR stamp in the box's notebook (log), and you stamp the BOX's stamp in your notebook.  If you carry a damp paper towel with you in a ziplock bag, it will make it easy to clean off the box's stamp before you put it back in the box.  It's a kindness to the next person who visits the box, so they don't have to clean the stamp before they use it.<br/>

I find that Baby Wipes work well too. I am so scttered that sometimes <br/>
letterboxing just happens. Baby Whipes live in my car and I generally <br/>
have a roll of paper towels too. It helps to have one of each to clean <br/>
and dry the stamps.<br/>

The smell (even unsented ones) attract animals that might tear into the box! Now on your personal stamps use them if you got em, though after time they will break down certain stamp materials!<br/>
