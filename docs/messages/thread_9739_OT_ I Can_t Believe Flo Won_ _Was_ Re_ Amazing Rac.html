crybaby Flo won! (None of my friends and family here at home or work <br/>
watch the show, so I haven't been able to vent to anyone! Sorry!) I'm <br/>
glad for Zach because of his long, long, long suffering, but why did <br/>
the first woman to win the race have to be that whining, <br/>
manipulative, snotty Flo? Why couldn't some kick-butt female like <br/>
Jill (and her equally kick-butt boyfriend John Vito) have won? By the <br/>
end of the race, I was even rooting for Teri and Ian because I <br/>
couldn't bear the thought of that psycho winning. She is such an <br/>
awful representative of the female gender.<br/>

Okay, going back to lurking now . . . <br/>

Hope everyone has a great weekend!<br/>

<div>Marsha, I totally agree with you.  Anyone could have won 
but her and I'd have been happy.  I too was hoping for Jill and John Vito 
to win!  They were such a cool couple.  Glad to hear you feel the same 
way.  I really enjoy the show but don't know that any of my friends watch 
it!  Molly of the Bonnie and Clyde Gang,</div>
