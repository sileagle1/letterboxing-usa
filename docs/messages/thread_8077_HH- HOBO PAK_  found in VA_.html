at the Muskrat Ramble in River Bend Park, VA.<br/>
<br/>
Just before Dark. <br/>
Cheif, who was on his first Lb, day hike. Had just finished finding <br/>
Possum Trot, His first LB, ever...<br/>
Then we made are way to Muskrat ramble, My turn to lead, Loved the <br/>
hike.. Riverbend was just a great place to be hiking this weekend.<br/>
Chief 2nd LB, and we find the HH.. First for the both of us..<br/>
With less than an hour before the Park closed the gate, I suggest one <br/>
more LB, Bee's Knees.  Very close by..<br/>
I had been there two weeks early, Chief was put in the parklot to <br/>
start, and in 15 minutes, he had found it.. We were on a fast pace <br/>
walk, so we could be back and out of the parking lot in time...<br/>
10 minute to spare..<br/>
<br/>
I think Chief, is going to be a LB for life now...<br/>
Thanks to all<br/>
