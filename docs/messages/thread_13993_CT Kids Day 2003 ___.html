box  for me to plant.[last fall was our second Kids day]  My goodness <br/>
Steve, start carving , that nice pink stuff will let you know where it <br/>
wants to go.so don't wait for fall. Yes, I did ask The Voyagers if the <br/>
possibility of a Kids day in  Northwest Park might work.  As you all <br/>
know, the" Winter Camping is for the Birds",  flew up to Northwest and <br/>
has been joined by other birds, one carved by Music Woman. If anyone has <br/>
an idea of where to have the Kids Day Gather this fall, there is no rule <br/>
it has to be in Rocky Neck , that is just where I set it up.I think it <br/>
would be great to have it in a different place   What say you all ??<br/>
