DuckiesFamily took a trip up north this weekend and decided to hit a couple <br/>
of Letterboxes while up there...we found Pemi Trail letterbox no problem <br/>
(the furry engineers were doing their job well and it was a little wet) but <br/>
we found it and got some neat pics....<br/>
but the one that alluded us was "The Old Man" letterbox...it is orphaned on <br/>
the site and I don;t know the last time it was found....any info on it?? <br/>
anyone find it recently??<br/>
we did have some nice ice cream at the stand but we couldn't find the <br/>
letterbox :(<br/>
<br/>
if anyone has any info as to the whereabouts of this box i would love to <br/>
hear it...<br/>
thanks!<br/>

&gt;Hi all...<br/>

<br/>
According to the clues I've seen, the "Pemi Trail" and "Old Man"<br/>
letterboxes are one and the same (same clues).<br/>
<br/>
I found "Old Man" on June 20th, and it was in good shape except for a<br/>
very full logbook.  I plan to return in a few weeks with a new logbook<br/>
for it (even though it's not my box)<br/>
