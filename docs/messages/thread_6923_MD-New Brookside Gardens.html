Placed August 12, 2002 by Di and J-Lo (of the Usual Suspects)<br/>
Location: Wheaton, Maryland (Montgomery County)<br/>
Accessability: Gardens open 9am to sunset every day, handicapped accessable.<br/>
Restrictions: No pets, no food and drink, no cycling.<br/>
<br/>
If you're in the area, come and visit Brookside Gardens.  Even if you're out <br/>
of the area, Brookside Gardens is worth the trip if you like flowers and <br/>
gardening.  The box has been left with the co-operation of Brookside Gardens <br/>
and if they like the positive feedback on the box, they may host a children's <br/>
workshop on letterboxing!  The more visitors, the better.  It also means that <br/>
we have to be ultra-respectful of the site; if any damage is associated with <br/>
letterboxers, they will ask me to remove the box.  Note that the gardens are <br/>
handicapped accessable, but the box is 30 or 40 feet off the paved path.  <br/>
There is no food or drink allowed in the park, but you can enjoy a picnic <br/>
right next door at Wheaton Regional Park.<br/>
