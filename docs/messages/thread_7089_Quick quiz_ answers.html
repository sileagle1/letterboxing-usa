<div>1.  Can you identify which Drew clue the picture <em>two of 'em </em>(photos section) relates to?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>     These two critters spotted me at <em>Whimsey Walk </em>in Old Lyme, CT.  Spots wanted to high-tail it... but Mama had doe eyes for me.  Must be that animal magnetism.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2.  Which letterbox had at least seven (apparently unrelated) parties log in on August 16th?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>     When I logged in the <em>Midnight on the Moon </em>box at Black Point, RI, I was more than a little surprised to see that six apparently unrelated parties had been there before me on the same day.  Some sort of strange harmonic convergence... </div>
<div> </div>
<div>3.  Where the hell is Paul?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>     Can someone in-the-know tell me if the Walrus is absent or merely aloof?</div>

Mocked by a mop-top.  How degrading.  Guess I'll have to go back.  <br/>
Man over mop-top is the only acceptable outcome of this contest.<br/>
<br/>
So far as Flutterby, I would hope that any concentration of <br/>
letterboxers would be a logical target.  I think Funhog keeps Kmartha <br/>
under her pillow.  Put the ol' Hake in play, Porkchop!<br/>
<br/>
I won't speak for the group, but feel free to take as many copies of <br/>
my stamp images as you want.  Sell them on ebay.  Make simulacrums or <br/>
outright forgeries of my stamps.  Claim that they're your own.  I <br/>
don't care.  Just be good enough to leave the original for everyone <br/>
else to have the same fun with.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to see some others are finally taking Jay up on his request to <br/>
put up some of their stamp images for public view.  I really enjoy <br/>
seeing what other people are working on and stealing their ideas.<br/>

MOP TOP , you say ??  DEGRADING ,you say ??  Hummm please note everyone<br/>
that it took a Butterfly to get this wonderful, fun and slippery person<br/>
to admit to being a MAN !! I am fluttering around like a ~~ butterfly<br/>
and just wish I could flit and find one of your boxes. I do have the<br/>
honor of stamping early on into Flutterby by the grace of Wanda and<br/>
Pete. Oh, to have bumped into you at Whimsy Walk. Sigh<br/>
