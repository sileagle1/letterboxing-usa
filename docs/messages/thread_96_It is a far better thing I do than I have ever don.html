 Gad! I do hope so ~ and hope the weather keeps cooperating!<br/>
 December is the goal, then.... and as for Evansville... is that also on<br/>
 the way to the new American Girl store and theater in Chicago? That's<br/>
 on the sub-units' list of things to do this December ~  I'll take the Art<br/>
 Institute, bound to be cheaper, too!<br/>

Huh?  What?  Beg your pardon?  Uh...Evansville?  Do you mean Evansville,<br/>
Indiana (and I'm just looking stupid)?  Or Evanston, Illinois which is where<br/>
my box is?  You know what?  I think there is an American Girl store in<br/>
Chicago, hmm... I was there (Michigan ave)  last week and I think I saw<br/>
something like that.  I don't know- my mom says they're the rage.  I've never<br/>
seen one myself.  I was never really into dolls since my brother tore all the<br/>
heads off my Barbies at a young age.  Yeah, best go to the Art Institute.  Say<br/>
hi to the lions for me.  <br/>
<br/>
We usually go to Wisc. like around X-mas (that's the 25th, I believe?), so you<br/>
got plenty of time if you want to put a box out by then.  Hey!  The weather's<br/>
GRRREAT here too!  I'm about to get spring fever!  Perhaps it would be best if<br/>
you come down this weekend?  Or tomarrow...<br/>
