Is this a crazy idea, or is it feasible? We keep seeing each other's stamps (and <br/>
feathers) all over; how about we put some faces to the names? It can be a <br/>

If anyone's interested, let's start suggesting possible dates and locations -- <br/>
I'm thinking of some time towards the end of February or beginning of March, <br/>
somewhere between Allentown and Princeton/Somerville. Then, after we get a <br/>
few suggestions, we can come to some sort of consensus (or I'll just put all of <br/>
the suggestions in a hat and pick one out).<br/>

Clinton or Flemington.<br/>
<br/>
There is a restaurant/bar, the Sunset, on Route 31 just north of Clinton. <br/>
Could accommodate a few or a gaggle. Picture a small Applebee's kind of <br/>
place, but owned by two buddies, not by a corporation. Booths, fairly <br/>
standard "American Fare", banquet room downstairs, bar upstairs, lots of <br/>
wood panelling, and not noisy like an Applebee's.<br/>
<br/>
I'll happily travel elsewhere to meet and greet and stamp.<br/>

Hurray for PA/NJ!<br/>
<br/>
We absolutely loved the couple of letterboxing trips we made down that<br/>
way recently, and can't wait to make a few more letterboxing trips and<br/>
friends!  (Hopefully, more than "sightings"  :-)  )  Please count us<br/>
in as part of the "New England contingent"!  Just give us the daylight<br/>
hours to drive down (c. 5hrs) and do some 'boxing on the way, and<br/>
we'll hope to meet you all somewhere after dark (say sixish?).  March<br/>
2nd at Raubsville sounds great!  Last time we were there (Dec. 23) we<br/>
managed to find 14 boxes in one day (both along the Delaware Canal and<br/>
amidst a variety of PA rocks) only to find out later, when we got<br/>
home, that even more boxes had been planted nearby during that very<br/>
same time frame!  So, we definitely have to get back down there, and<br/>
now we'll be looking forward to meeting as many of you fine folks as<br/>
we can at the same time!<br/>
