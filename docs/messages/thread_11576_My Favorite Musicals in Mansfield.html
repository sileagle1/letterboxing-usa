                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today I spent about 2 1/2 hours out in the wonderful Coney Rock  <br/>
Preserve hunting for musical letterboxes placed by Pink Trotters and <br/>
Leader of the Pack. Sound of Music and Coal Miner's Daughter needed a <br/>
little camoflauging after I stamped in. All the boxes I found were in <br/>
excellent shape.  Last stamp-in was Dec. 23rd.  May have been earlier <br/>
stamps for the first box..I was too busy watching out for other <br/>
hikers, as this is near the start of the trail. Besides the 2 boxes <br/>
already mentioned, I found Phantom of the Opera, Friedrick, and Kurt. <br/>
Liesl and Louisa escpaed my detection..this time;-) So, 5 boxes found <br/>
and 16 to go!! The threatened rain started to gently pitterpatter <br/>
down so I beat a hasty retreat. Made it to my car just as the <br/>
downpour started. I'd love to see a trail map of this preserve so I <br/>
can get a sense of it. Many thanks to the letterbox hiders for well <br/>
thought out clues and creative handcarved stamps.<br/>
