My Hubby will be working with the Cub Scouts this coming year. They<br/>
were talking about Christmas in July and one of the old Dads said they<br/>
have had Christmas in July forever in the cub scout pack.<br/>
<br/>
I talked with the Jedi Team this morning and they said it was one of<br/>
the Admin (Erik) who was the problem. They wrote a Letter to the person<br/>
in Charge of Geocaching.com and are waiting for a reply.<br/>
<br/>
I know the other Letterboxers from the Tristate area (ohio, kentucky<br/>
and indiana) who came to the first leterbox gathering know the<br/>
Docman from Team Jedi. He and John have the lion share of stamps in<br/>
this area and it would be kind of bare without those two. I just<br/>
can't believe someone who have a problem with him.  "Oh Well"<br/>
<br/>
I just think it's sad how just a very few people can put a damper<br/>
on everyone's fun so easy by Just being a jerk. (i.e. Erik)  Sad!<br/>

Yeah but thats the world these days. I never heard of Erik. Jeremy is the
big wig at geocaching.com. He is basically the one who derived geocaching
from letterboxing and he owns the website. Erik must be a volunteer.
Unfortunately even if you ignore jerks like that they still wont go
away.  :-)<br/><br/>
The first time I posted on the geocache list some jerk replied and called
me a vulgar name because the post had the yahoo ad attached at the
bottom. I have never seen him post again so I guess the list owner booted
him. Funny how people will hide behind a computer and mouth off. Of
coursre they cant get punched then.  :-)<br/><br/>
There are two letterboxes around Harrisonburg. I am planning on hiding
some as soon as I get some questions answered that I posted to the list.
I have about 12 geocaches hidden. I took a reporter and photographer to
the mountains geocaching back this summer. They did a big article on it
with pics and everything. Since it was published geocaching has grown
tremendously in the area. Before that I was the sole geocacher in the
area. As soon as I learn all the intricacies of letterboxing I will
contact them about an article on it. It would be a good followup story as
the article mentioned geocaching was a hi tech version of letterboxing.
Well I'm off to super wally world to get a couple erasers to make my
stamp.<br/>

When  I  found the skull near camp, the first thing I

call  the police.  But then I got curious about it.  I

&gt; [Jeremy] is basically the one who derived geocaching from letterboxing <br/>
<br/>
Just for the record and not that it matters, but this is untrue.  Dave <br/>
Ulmer invented geocaching (it was called gps stash hunt in those days) <br/>
independent of letterboxing as a reaction to SA being turned off.  Matt <br/>
Strom (and someone else other than Jeremy) invented the term <br/>
"geocaching"; and by the time geocaching.com was online, the activity <br/>
already had its basic form [...].  I could go on, but the history is <br/>
public or at least it used to be if it isn't now.<br/>
<br/>
As for non-straighforward clues, there are tons of them (but perhaps not<br/>
in percentage terms).  Sometimes they find you ... or they are invisible <br/>
to those who don't have what it takes (or the interest/time/resources) to <br/>
solve them anyway, so this arrangement tends to work out.  In any case, <br/>
I claim the clues I've written are generally non-straightforward for the <br/>
most part, and tend to offer a large diversity of challenges: <br/>
http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/index.html ... but you can do what you want, <br/>
and people will ignore you if they don't like it.  If your question <br/>
was ... can I do non-straightforward clues and expect people to look for <br/>
them ... that is a different kettle of fish altogether, and something to<br/>
consider if you care about people looking for them ...<br/>
<br/>
As for your other question on the length of the hikes, I tend to agree that<br/>
the hikes are too short for east coast letterboxes in general.  Before<br/>
anyone flames me, just my opinion :-)  Aside from Jay Drew's "Feather"<br/>
series in Rhode Island, I can't remember a hike of more than 2 or 3 miles,<br/>
and that was to find 4 boxes, so the average may have been in that range.<br/>
Most hikes tend to be less than a mile, so by all means, throw some 20<br/>
milers at us ... with impossible clues to boot ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

&gt; &gt;My Hubby will be working with the Cub Scouts this coming year. They<br/>
&gt; &gt;were talking about Christmas in July and one of the old Dads said they<br/>
&gt; &gt;have had Christmas in July forever in the cub scout pack.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I talked with the Jedi Team this morning and they said it was one of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the Admin (Erik) who was the problem. They wrote a Letter to the person<br/>
&gt; &gt;in Charge of Geocaching.com and are waiting for a reply.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I know the other Letterboxers from the Tristate area (ohio, kentucky<br/>
&gt; &gt;and indiana) who came to the first leterbox gathering know the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Docman from Team Jedi. He and John have the lion share of stamps in<br/>
&gt; &gt;this area and it would be kind of bare without those two. I just<br/>
&gt; &gt;can't believe someone who have a problem with him.  "Oh Well"<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I just think it's sad how just a very few people can put a damper<br/>
&gt; &gt;on everyone's fun so easy by Just being a jerk. (i.e. Erik)  Sad!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Not someone at Geocaching.com.  Some geocacher on one of the forums.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;When I was in college I worked at a boy scout camp in the summers. We <br/>
&gt;had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Christmas in July at the camp. Complete with a freshly cut and <br/>
&gt;decorated<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Christmas tree.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;As I bit into the nectarine, it had a crisp juiciness about it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;that was very pleasurable - until I realized it wasn't a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;nectarine at all, but A HUMAN HEAD!!<br/>
