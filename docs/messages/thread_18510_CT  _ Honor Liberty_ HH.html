This HH has a little different concept, once found the finder is supposed to put on the chat list where it was left so that it would move about quickly. Sometime last October or first of November a letterboxer picked up "Honor Liberty" where Patrick, Amy &amp; Ruth had left it and it has gone missing. The HH got it's start on September 12, 2002 ( a year and a day after 9/11/2001) and we posted it's travels for one year (see chat list message 34174, 10/3/2003). Maybe someone can figure out where she may be and give her a jump start.<br/>
