Difficulty:  short hilly walk (rocky path)<br/>
Boxes:  Two<br/>
<br/>
Tariffville Gorge (towering cliffs and scenic beauty) is off <br/>
Spoonville Road in East Granby, CT.  Take Rt 187N over bridge of <br/>
Farmington River.  Take your first right onto Spoonville Road, then <br/>
another right, to stay on Spoonville. Continue on it towards the <br/>
River (road actually changes to Tunxis Ave at the water).  Follow it <br/>
to the very end until you reach a cul de sac parking area.<br/>
<br/>
Facing the River, take the path to your left.  Go down the hill on <br/>
the main path.  Shortly you will see the River straight ahead.  At <br/>
the fork, bear left, looking for a fallen tree off the main path on <br/>
your left.   Look behind the standing tree, next to fallen tree, <br/>
under the rock; there you will find the first stamp.  Log in and <br/>
place it discreetly back as this main path can be highly traveled <br/>
with kayakers.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on down by the River.  Enjoy the area.  Explore the beach, <br/>
have a picnic or skim some rocks. If you are lucky you'll catch a<br/>
few <br/>
whitewater kayakers in action! (Nationally renowned area for <br/>
whitewater canoe and kayak venues)<br/>
<br/>
To find the second stamp (which is to be stamped in the middle of the <br/>
first stamp), go back up the hill to the parking area.  Proceed down <br/>
the path on the other side of parking lot, toward the River.  Go down <br/>
main paved path to the lookout on your left.  Then proceed down the <br/>
rocky dirt path closest to the water.  Stay to the right on this <br/>
path.  Soon you will step over two fallen tree trunks.  Shortly you <br/>
will see a large rock on your left, with a 3-trunk tree on your <br/>
right.  Go about 10 paces til you see a very large, tall oak tree <br/>
with a pile of rocks at about 130 degrees compass reading.  Climb up <br/>
to tree and your second stamp lies behind two rocks on the northeast <br/>
side of the tree.  Above, you will notice a higher path.  <br/>
       Thanks for coming to "Spoonville"  hope you<br/>
enjoyed your <br/>
visit.<br/>
