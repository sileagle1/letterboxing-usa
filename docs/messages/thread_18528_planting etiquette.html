<br/>
First off, I make a First Finder "certificate" and place a copy of the stamp and then sign it, kinda like a one of a <br/>
kind signed print by the artist. (Grin)  We place that in the box and plant it nice and pretty.  We've also included a <br/>
nick-nack that is appropriate to the theme of the box if we could find one.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I think this. Go ahead and do what you want to concerning this aspect and if the person finding the box <br/>
wants to, they'll take it and cherish if, if they don't, they won't.  And I'd not worry too much about it either way! <br/>
(grin)<br/>

Hope this helps.<br/>

I agree with Steve entirely, I think you should do what you want and <br/>
know that nobody will get too upset if you leave a present for the <br/>
first finder. <br/>
<br/>
Just as a FYI and to let you know what Team Chaos does We tend to <br/>
put stickers in our letterboxes with a little note on the back of <br/>
the sticker that says "Congratulations you are the first finder." I <br/>
just think the stickers make a nice addition to the log books.  <br/>
<br/>
I know that CampFireLady has done some really need things with first <br/>
finder awards such as taking the stamp, stamping it and coloring in <br/>
on shrink it and placing that in the boxes as a little charm for the <br/>
first person that finds the box. I am so eager to get one of those <br/>
little charms in my log book I can hardly tell you.  Unfortunately <br/>
none of the boxes that I have had first finder on had prizes!<br/>
<br/>
I bid you well,<br/>

I like the first finder certificate idea, but I REALLY like the first finder geocache<br/>
button I found.  I'll probably steal the general idea and make buttons with my<br/>
stamp image on them.<br/>
<br/>
The button in question is in the top left hand corner of the following page:<br/>

Hey there,<br/>
<br/>
Here's one of the BEST Girl Scout leader tricks I ever learned.<br/>
#6 recyclable plastic shrinks down just like shrinky dinks (and<br/>
it's a heck of a lot cheaper.)  <br/>
<br/>
I get mine from chinese food containers (the black and clear topped<br/>
ones) but you can also use the white foam ones that come from <br/>
the salad bar in MY local supermarket.  just look for the "6" in the <br/>
recycle symbol.  <br/>
<br/>
I go for about 250 degrees and it takes a very short time, not more <br/>
than about 15 - 30 seconds... I find that it's easier to use the toaster <br/>
overna and that it's handy to have a spatula close by in case you need<br/>
to flatten the sucker out a bit immediately after pulling it out of the <br/>
oven.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they mess up on you for no recognizable reason, but heck..<br/>
what do you want for free?<br/>
<br/>
