Location: Near Bainbridge, Ohio. Driving directions: Going east on <br/>
Rt. 50 after passing Paint Creek State Park there will be a rest <br/>
area about a mile up the road and on your left. This is west of <br/>
Bainbridge Ohio. Go to this rest area. CLUES: Start at the brown, <br/>
sheltered sign which displays a map of Ohio. Take a compass reading <br/>
of 85 degrees and go 18 paces at that heading to a large pine tree. <br/>
Then go 16 paces at 52 degrees from this pine to a picnic table. <br/>
Finally, fron the northwest corner of the picnic table, go 6 paces <br/>
due north to a Maple tree with a small cave-like opening at the base <br/>
of its trunk. The box is resting in this little cave, covered by <br/>
some leaves.<br/>
