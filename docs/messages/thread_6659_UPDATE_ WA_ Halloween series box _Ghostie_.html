<br/>
Problem with the clues, though, for Ghostie. I had found the Halloween boxes before, and knew where they were. However, based on the clues on the site, we thought Amanda had moved it. We looked all over, but had no luck. So we walked down the trail to check, just for fun, to see if it might be where I had found it before. It was.<br/>
<br/>
The clues need to be updated. Hopefully Amanda will chime in with exact information, but this is what we found:<br/>
<br/>
There is a paragraph that reads "To find the letterboxes, take the Red Town Trail (W2) to the left. The trails are all very well marked. Also, please stay on the trails; the park is riddled with mine openings. Next, take the Cave Hole Trail to the left. When you reach the sign for the Coal Creek Falls Trail, take a heading of 330 degrees. This should lead you to a multi-trunked tree with some cedars behind it. At the base of the multi-trunked tree is the first Halloween letterbox (Ghostie). Hidden among the roots, and covered with leaves, branches and bits of bark."<br/>
<br/>
THIS IS INCORRECT. Part of the clue are missing. You need to hike down the Coal Creek Falls Trail some distance, 43 paces I believe, before you take the heading of 330 degrees.  You will see the multi-trunked tree on your right after going down the Coal Creek Falls Trail, and there is a nurse log/stump right next to that tree.<br/>
