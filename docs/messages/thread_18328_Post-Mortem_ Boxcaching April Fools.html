and seemed surprised when we emailed him on the 1st. Apparently there are<br/>
quite a few people who have access to removing, editing, and deleting<br/>
various pages on the letterboxing.org site. Since there are no actual<br/>
safeguards against it, anyone with the access can do whatever they want,<br/>
such as redirecting your browser to another web site.<br/>
<br/>
My apologies to Randy Hall since he had nothing to do with the poorly<br/>
executed April Fools joke. Hopefully the site is backed up often.<br/>

Poorly executed?  No, no, no!  I beg to differ!  I think it was very well <br/>
executed!  It sure got your feathers in a ruffle, didn't it?<br/>

it was completely new and innovative and simply put brilliant.  April Fool's<br/>
jokes will not be to everyone's liking, never have never will.  It was done<br/>
tongue in cheek without harming anyone's property or good name.<br/>
