wonderful to squeeze in a letterbox. Nice carving job! Do I remember <br/>
you saying that you use the transfer-xeroxed-image-to-stamp-with-<br/>
acetone technique? I've never been able to make that work and just <br/>
freehand them, but would like to try again.<br/>

Thom, et al.<br/>
<br/>
With all of the requests and instructions flying around telling<br/>
you what to do and how to do it re: the database and website,<br/>
I just wanted to throw in a "Thank You" for the website as it<br/>
exists now. It looks nice, it's easy to navigate, and there is<br/>
a lot of info already in place. (Kudos also to Randy for the<br/>
well written FAQ) Even if you didn't do anything more from now<br/>
on, you've still done a great job and have responded very quickly<br/>
to the increasing number of clues being posted.<br/>
That's not to say that I wouldn't mind seeing more, of course,<br/>
but I thought it appropriate to let you know that your work is<br/>
very much appreciated by all of us. Your site is THE center for<br/>
letterboxing on this side of the pond.<br/>

Thank you for the mystery box clues- I haven't been to the Bangor area since <br/>
Christmas so haven't had the chance to wander around for the box...  I am due <br/>
to have a baby in a few weeks and have been on an evening plan of modified <br/>
bed rest so traveling has been out of the question (and I have been having a <br/>
hard time keeping up with regular correspondence as well!)  <br/>
The head light box looks great- this summer we are planning a grand sweep of <br/>
Maine with baby in tow and will have to be sure to find not only this one but <br/>
the mystery box and begin working on your quest...<br/>
Hope all is well up your way- it feels like an Island spring day here.<br/>

And thanks everyone for coming, we certainly had plenty of the promised <br/>
famous out of state letterboxers, loose lips, gossip, event stamps, and <br/>
other curios.  Hopefully we can do it again sometime.  Special thanks to<br/>
Alafair and Sandy for creating the event stamps.<br/>

Hopefully I'll meet more of y'all in the future.<br/>
