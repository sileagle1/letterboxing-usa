Maryland I-95 Service Area Boxes by Cavalier Manor<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxes are supposed to be in a beautiful, interesting, or remote location. Although these service areas are none of the above, perhaps the Gas-n-Go and Pit Stop microboxes will make the I-95 drive a bit more bearable. Maybe eventually we can get whole chains of boxes going at rest stops throughout the country! There are two  one for the journey and one for the return.<br/>
<br/>
The clues are straightforward to minimize suspicious wandering about and frustration for tired brains. <br/>

Gas-n-Go Microbox<br/>

<br/>
Chesapeake House Service Area / I-95<br/>
<br/>
North East, MD<br/>
<br/>
Cecil County<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can find this box from either the southbound or northbound sides of the rest stop.<br/>
<br/>
Find the white footprints and follow them. Some lead to the Batmobile. Others lead to a purple dinosaur (not Barney, thank goodness!).<br/>
<br/>
Where the footprints end, you could go inside for a beverage and snack. But you seek a different type of refreshment  a nice view, a walk in the woods, a place to unkink the aches that come from a roadtrip  so instead you turn and go up the grassy hill. <br/>
<br/>
When you reach the highest picnic table, take a moment to enjoy the view (well, at least its better than staring at taillights). Then, turn to your left where you will see a little path into the woods. Your brief escape into the forest! After the path curves to the right, look for a larger tree with a stump beside it. Your treasure lies behind that stump. <br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>

Pit Stop Microbox<br/>
<br/>
By Cavalier Manor<br/>
<br/>
Placed April 9, 2003<br/>
<br/>
Maryland House Service Area / I-95<br/>
<br/>
Aberdeen, Maryland<br/>
<br/>
Harford County<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You may want to get your icy or piping hot beverage before you begin.<br/>
<br/>
Begin your pit stop in front of the house facing the three flags. Take a moment to read the highlights of the Maryland Colony on the historical marker to your left. Turn right and go down the ramp. On the way, you can learn more about Maryland State history. Who knew pit stops could be so edifying?<br/>
<br/>
At the bottom of the ramp, turn left. Pretty soon youll be walking next to a brick wall. Follow it all the way to the end. This would be a good time to bring out that drink and have a seat under the big tree youll find. Your treasure is at the very end of the wall. <br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>
