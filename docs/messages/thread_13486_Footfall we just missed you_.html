the Herrick Lake letterbox while you were stamping up! We <br/>
thought it was lost and gave Melinda &amp; Kate a heart attack when <br/>
we emailed them to tell them we couldn't find it. But oddly <br/>
enough, it was just pure timing on our part that we couln't find the <br/>
box. I just thought that you would get a kick out of that story <br/>
because we did. Funny thing was, we were joking about how <br/>
rare it would be for us to run into a fellow letterboxer as we were <br/>
doing that exact hike! <br/>
<br/>
See ya around the next letterbox<br/>
