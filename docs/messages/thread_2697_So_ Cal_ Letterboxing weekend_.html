                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Team Saulsa<br/>
Thanks for info on our boxes.  We checked Shore Bird last night on way to<br/>
Wendy's Pelican and the Geocache site nearby.  Since Shore Bird is close to<br/>
home we will keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't run out of paper.<br/>
We visited Conejo Open Space several months ago and found the walk<br/>
beautiful.  We went too far on trail  but finally worked our way to the box<br/>
site.  Several weeks later we tried for Star of Feanor and got skunked.  We<br/>
beat the bushes and trees for a long time before we gave up and figured it<br/>
wasn't meant to be.  Got any hints?   Hope you can check out our other L. B.<br/>
area boxes<br/>
plus Squirrel's boxes, especially the one at Mt. Baldy.Regards, Don &amp; Gwen.<br/>
