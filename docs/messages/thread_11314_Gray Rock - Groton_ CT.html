Maddie and I found the Gray Rock boxes in Groton today, definately a <br/>
nice walk though my legs are still tired from that trek up the big <br/>
hill!   What a view from the top!  Both boxes were in fine <br/>
condition.  Found our first HH - the Vagabond Vulture at box #1. It <br/>
will make its way into circulation early next week!<br/>
<br/>
Spring is definately upon us today.... saw plenty of robins, some <br/>
woodpeckers, and the 2nd bluebird of the season! (First one was last <br/>
weekend in East Lyme.)<br/>
<br/>
I was amazed by how much dirtbike and mtn bike activity the trails <br/>
at Gray Rock get. It made for some very muddy and slick area so use <br/>
caution on the first 1/2 of the journey should you try it.  <br/>
