<br/>
This box was reported MIA while I was in transit, and Candlelight went to <br/>
check this weekend and found it, in a slightly different location than was <br/>
listed in the clues.  However, she didn't check to see if the stamp was inside.<br/>
<br/>
Hoopoe graciously offered to put a newly-carved stamp inside if it is, <br/>
indeed, missing, but if someone happens to be in the Carkeek Park area and <br/>
has a few unfettered minutes to check to see if it's really there (or <br/>
not!), I'd be very appreciative. ;)  (My time's at a premium these days <br/>
while I get settled and while I'd not have a problem re-carving, I'd rather <br/>
spend the time littering the Nebraska countryside with boxes for people to <br/>
visit than carving two of the salmon series! :&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

series this week and found the King Salmon stamp in the Salmon Run <br/>
(#3) box.  I don't know why this wasn't spotted earlier, but I <br/>
returned the stamp to the right box.  Thanks for the great series!  <br/>
This was my first try at letterboxing, and now I know it won't be my <br/>
last!<br/>
