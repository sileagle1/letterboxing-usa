 I started myself just recently inletterboxing after by chance encountering the LBNA's website. So, I probably can't give you any real advice for I am a "Newbie" at this point. The only thing I can say is: Compass, Maps of thearea intended, Bino's and lots of water always worked for me when I went to look for my first 2 letterboxes in the wilds. Yep, only 2 reletively easy to moderate letterboxes I located and I'm planning on #3, soon. My Stamp is an Owl (green stamp ink). But, I just might change that to a "Fire Breathing Dragon". My letterboxing kit isbasic, 1)Rubber Stamp &amp; Ink Pad. 2) Journalbook (blank pages)with both pen and pencil.. 3) Back Pack (w/compass, maps and bino) Along with water/snacks and TOILET PAPER ( I usually never trust the outhouses of city and national parks to have useable or available toilet papers. So, I bring my own). <br/>
<br/>
Sorry IF this doesn't help. But, until I myself become more proficient at this, that's all I can tell you. ;-]<br/>

That pretty much sums it up.  Grab your stamp, logbook and clues and <br/>
have a good time.  Don't get stuck on the details.<br/>

Andthat's an affirmative on that:Saving up and acquiring the rightfinances to do so is always a prognostication. Looking at Colorado Springs (around an 1.5 hours? south of Denver) and I'll be definately burning the trails for LB'n (already checked out on the LBNA Web for Colorado). It'll be great I'm sure.And I got a plans ofmy own to assemble "LBcontainer(s)"to be planted around for others to look for, and I'm sure it would be fun doing so -But, I'll wait on that until I get there.= }<br/>
