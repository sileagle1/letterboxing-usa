The stamp is 1/2 inch by 1 inch by 1/4 inch.  The log is cash <br/>
register tape folded in half lengthwise, then accordian-folded.<br/>
<br/>
It's had several visitors, which is as many as any of my boxes in <br/>
this state of few boxers.  I think it was great fun to make one so <br/>
small and I plan to do another similar one soon.  It's **real** easy <br/>
to hide!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I placed a box about a year ago that was actually one of those <br/>
Listerine Breath Strip boxes.  The stamp was about the size of a <br/>
postage stamp and the log 'book' was a strip of paper about 3 feet <br/>
long that was folded to fit inside the little box.  <br/>
<br/>
Some folks that found it said it was mighty small and kind of hard to <br/>
stamp into but found it kind of fun since it was soooooo small.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunatly, the box disappeared about 4 months later.  Havent <br/>
gotten around to carving another mini to replace it.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A box is too small if it's smaller than necessary.  I understand the <br/>
challenge in creating the "World's xyz Letterbox" (fill in xyz with <br/>
the adjective of your choice--smallest in this case), but I sometimes <br/>
find it annoying if there's not really a good reason for it.  Create <br/>
an extra small stamp because the location demands it, not to prove it <br/>
can be done.  Know what I mean?<br/>
<br/>
I've hidden lots of microboxes, although I'll admit I'm not a big fan <br/>
of them.  I like elaborate stamps, and the ones found in microboxes <br/>
rarely are for lack of carving space.  I like the logbook to have <br/>
lots of room for my signature stamp and for people to write in <br/>
whatever comments they want.  But where I've used microboxes, I've <br/>
always had a reason for it.  It might be because it's in a heavily <br/>
travelled and very public area and needs to be small so nobody will <br/>
see it.  I hid a bunch of them on the Appalachain Trail because I <br/>
didn't want to carry a dozen normal-sized boxes on my back for <br/>
hundreds of miles (for space AND weight reasons).  But there was <br/>
always a reason I used a microbox--not just for the sake of using one.<br/>
<br/>
So....  Go ahead and create a nano-box, but please place it in a <br/>
location where anything bigger would be virtually impossible to hide <br/>
well!  Make it a nano-box for a reason and really impress the pants <br/>
off everyone!<br/>
