Since this has all been discussed so much recently, I brought up<br/>
geocaching (letterboxers are few and far in these parts) at a staff<br/>
meeting with all the supervisory rangers/resource managers/maintenance<br/>
chiefs this morning.<br/>
<br/>
We determined that boxing is well within department policy, provided<br/>
that boxers don't break any laws or park regulations. This means no<br/>
boxes in Natural or Cultural Preserves, no boxes that damage resources,<br/>
encourage finders to damage resources (trailing), or impact sensitive<br/>
habitat. Rangers will remove boxes located in hazardous areas. Otherwise<br/>
everyone seemed to think it was just a novel way to enjoy the parks-<br/>
nobody had any problem with it.<br/>
<br/>
Do rangers want to know about the boxes?  Their primary job is public<br/>
safety, so yeah, they are probably happiest when they know where people<br/>
are and what they are doing.  None of them expect to be notified or<br/>
asked before anyone places a box though.  Out of a dozen geocaches here<br/>
they have only removed one, due to safety reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Some postings I have seen on chat groups talk about rangers as though<br/>
they are the enemy. They aren't.  They do this because they love the<br/>
land, they enjoy the visitors, and they want to allow people the<br/>
opportunity to spend time outdoors and learn about nature. If they were<br/>
all about busting people, they would be working for a sheriff's<br/>
department for much better pay ;-) Honestly, if you show a ranger your<br/>
logbook she is very likely to be buying a speedball kit on her way home<br/>
from work.<br/>
<br/>
have fun,<br/>

&gt; Just curious, but for your parks (not sure which ones exactly), but do<br/>
&gt; the rangers prefer to know about boxes in the parks, or do they care?<br/>
&gt; I am specifically interested in letterboxes of course.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Not only are they allowed in my parks (a rather large chunk of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; California system), but two of our rangers are purchasing additional<br/>
&gt; &gt; GPS units so they can teach Geocaching to the visitors.<br/>
