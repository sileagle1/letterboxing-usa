is making a stop at the Perry house. Mom and Barbara tried to place him<br/>
at Pattasquamcutt Rock, but after crawling up the rock on their hands<br/>
and knees, they found the letterbox to be missing. Then they bounced<br/>
down the rock on their backsides'. If the box is still there please let<br/>
us know, however they have stated "they don't care if the box is there,<br/>
there's no way there going back up there to look." However I would like<br/>
to know so that others may know if it is indeed missing.<br/>
<br/>
"Ready Freddy is going local. Good for him."<br/>

I will check on Vikings tomorrow.  The box must have migrated even <br/>
farther under the rock (or grown legs).  It was there a week or so <br/>
ago.  One recommendation that I would give to those climbing the rock <br/>
in icy weather is to take the path FAR off to the right just before <br/>
you get to the face.  It is so far off that it looks like it is just <br/>
heading into the woods.  The trail up, otherwise, can be a scramble <br/>
and very tricky in icy conditions.  It's well worth the climb for the <br/>
view regardless.<br/>
