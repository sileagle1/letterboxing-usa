Well...  I am pretty new at this and not quite "hip with the lingo" but all <br/>
the same recognized the extra book and stamp as a hitchhiker (my first one- <br/>
yahoo!)<br/>
So yesterday I picked up "Run Like a Deer" that was placed by the <br/>
Cock-a-doodle-moo 4H club.  I do not know where it originated (there is <br/>
little info in the book) but I picked it up at Susie Sells Seashells by the <br/>
Seashore, Rye, New Hampshire.  I am going to drop it off today- do I have to <br/>
tell you where???  <br/>
Anyway- thanks for a great new hobby and Cheers to the Drew Clan in CT!  We <br/>
must live in the midst of their boxes- several in walking distance of home.<br/>
Have a great day<br/>

We have tried to contact the owners of the hitchhiker as requested in the note pad. But, AOL says "no such member." If the owners teamweens would like to know where the box was placed please contact us directly. Beavisbunc@aol.com<br/>
