the Audubon Nature Sanctuary in the City of Portland, Multnomah County, <br/>
Oregon. This is a short hike but in just one mile you will see old <br/>
growth firs, Balch Creek and a tranquil pond. Portland boasts one of <br/>
the oldest branches of the venerable Audubon Society and this <br/>
sanctuary, so close to the city center, is a wonderful oasis for <br/>
visitors. If your journal is big enough (at least 3X5 inches) this <br/>
series of stamps forms a picture when the first three  are placed in <br/>
the right positions. The first one goes at the top and a bit to the <br/>
left. Number two goes below the first and a little right. Three goes <br/>
below two, slightly left. The last box gives you free reign. You can <br/>
stamp any old place and as many times as you like.<br/>
