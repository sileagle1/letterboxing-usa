                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well Tom...I can't answer that question specifically... but I can tell you letterboxing started <br/>
in Dartmoor [in England] in the 1850's. And has developed to now, to using the internet. <br/>
But they did it for at least 140 years without the internet. :-) Maybe your two suggestions <br/>
were options. <br/>
<br/>
Oh and you definitely can find clues to one person's boxes in another person's boxes, and <br/>
I have found clues to a 2nd box, not listed, in the 1st box that is listed on the websites, <br/>
and that box had clues to a 3rd box, and so on. If you are in IL, the Cottontails are <br/>
notorious for that. There are also Hitch hikers, where a moving box is placed INSIDE <br/>
someone's box, you find it and move it on to the next one. And cooties, where people <br/>
drop boxes [very small] on anothe rphysical person who then finds it and has tro pass it <br/>
on [for instance, slipping into someone's bag or jacket pocket when they are not looking]. <br/>
Some people release clues via word of mouth only. One person I've heard of will only <br/>
release clues if you meet him in person and ASK for them. And so on.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of this conversation, my understanding was, the clues were not removed from the <br/>
internet entirely -- they were simply removed from the 2 main websites people use. <br/>
Doesn't mean they are not elsewhere on the internet -- for example, the placer may have <br/>
a blog or personal website with clues posted.<br/>

&gt; As a *very* newcomer to the game, I have to ask, if this isn't an <br/>
&gt; intrinsically Internet driven game, how and where does one find clues ? Are <br/>
&gt; they hidden in newspaper classifieds ?  Should one expect to find clues to <br/>
&gt; placer A's boxes in placer B's boxes ?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Seriously, I find this whole argument impenetrable.  I simply can't imagine <br/>
&gt; how this could work, absent the Internet.  I suspect that I would be deeply <br/>
&gt; appreciative of what you are talking about if I had any notion of what it is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I got here through Geocaching, which I'm assuming is seen among the <br/>
&gt; letterboxing folk as a poor relation, and frankly, I agree that it lacks much <br/>
&gt; of the romance.  But I'm missing a crucial element.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Where does one look for "hidden clues" ?  Does Phyto expect us to look into <br/>
&gt; great literature, the public registry of deeds, the Yellowpages ?  I just <br/>
&gt; don't get it !<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would greatly appreciate it if someone could step back from this and provide <br/>
&gt; a hint.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Right, that's my understanding too. The clues are on the internet. The<br/>
challenge is to find them. So I'm going to give it a go. <br/>
