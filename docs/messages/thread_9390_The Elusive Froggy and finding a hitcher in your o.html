Moore park is a lot of fun but the trails do cross each other every <br/>
several feet so it is amazingly easy to get lost.  Add fallen leaves, <br/>
pending darkness, and sheer frustration and I can see how easy it <br/>
would be to lose your way.  <br/>
<br/>
Do not feel bad if you didn't find them on the first try.  We were <br/>
concerned when we wrote the clues that with all of the twists and <br/>
turns and the story that it would be a more challenging series to <br/>
find than most of our others.  Do perservere though because the <br/>
stamps are pretty cool.<br/>

Thanks to the many who posted about finding a hitcher in your own <br/>
box.  I found the Phoenix hitcher in our Loonerism box quite a while <br/>
ago and since it was our first hitcher foun I could not bring myself <br/>
to leave it there.  I felt guilty for a while about taking it but <br/>
felt as most do that a find is a find no matter whose box you find it <br/>
in.  Thanks again for assuaging my guilt especially around the <br/>
holiday season when guilt seems to be almost as plentiful as plaid <br/>
stuff and ribbon.<br/>
