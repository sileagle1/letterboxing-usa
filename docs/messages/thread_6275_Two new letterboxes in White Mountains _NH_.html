Two new letterboxes were placed on July 13, 2002 in the Crawford Notch area <br/>
of the White Mountains in NH.  The nearest town is shown as Notchland and <br/>
these are in Carroll county.  The boxes were placed by the McCarthy's and <br/>
these are the first boxes that we have placed.<br/>
<br/>
The two boxes are described as follows:<br/>
<br/>
"Arethusa Falls Letterbox" Follow the Arethusa Falls Trail to the falls.  <br/>
This is a moderate trail with a 750' elevation gain in approximately 1.5 <br/>
miles.  In nice weather this is a beautiful area for lunch and may be <br/>
somewhat busy with other hikers.  From the trail junction sign at the base <br/>
of the falls sight 260 degrees, up the steep trail to the left.  The trail <br/>
is narrow at first, then approximately 75' up, the trail widens due to a <br/>
heavily eroded area.  Look to the left for a white birch which is 10' off <br/>
the trail.  The prize should be located behind the birch and under several <br/>
small rocks.<br/>
<br/>
"Franky's Letterbox" Continue from the Arethusa Falls along the Frankenstein <br/>
Cliff Trail.  Follow this trail to a high point at 2,560 feet with a view of <br/>
Mount Washington to the northeast.  Continue on the trail to the "Lower <br/>
Frankenstein Cliff" at an elevation of 2,130 feet.  Stand in front of the <br/>
sign and trees facing Rt 302 and the Saco River to the south.  Sight 105 <br/>
degrees and proceed down the rock slope approximately 60 feet, nearly to the <br/>
woods.  Turn left into a "notch" in the trees and proceed 15 feet.  Look <br/>
under a piece of rock / ledge to the left for Franky.<br/>
