&gt; stuff wash your shoes. Especially the laces. That's how I've gotten <br/>
&gt; reinfected.<br/>
<br/>
Well, even better than just staying away from any plant that has <br/>
three leaves, learn to identify it.  Not ALL plants with leaves of <br/>
three is poison oak!  Growing up in California where there is poison <br/>
oak EVERYWHERE, it never ceases to amaze me at how few people on the <br/>
trail are actually able to identify it and instead go running from <br/>
any plant that has three leaves, whether it's poison oak or not.<br/>
<br/>
But even then, avoiding any plant with three leaves isn't good <br/>
enough, since at certain times of the year (i.e. winter!) the leaves <br/>
could have withered up and fallen off.  But you can still get poison <br/>
oak from the oils left behind.  At which point it becomes important <br/>
to learn to recognize the types of area that's likely to have poison <br/>
oak regardless of whether it's actually visible or not.<br/>
<br/>
In California, it's most prevelent near water sources such as on the <br/>
shores of streams and lakes and protected by shade.  And at lower <br/>
altitudes--say, below 3000 feet.  If you're hiking around in the <br/>
Sierra Nevadas, you're free from worry!<br/>
<br/>
Strangely, in the Pacific Northwest, I've noticed that it's almost <br/>
the complete opposite and poison oak is usually found in open areas <br/>
basking in the sunlight away from streams and lakes.  Up in the <br/>
higher elevations like on Mount Hood I've never been able to find it, <br/>
but along exposed ridgecrests of lower elevations it's prominent.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, it's a little late for Eric, and he has my sympathies.<br/>
<br/>
Washing the shoes is a good idea--I hadn't thought of that before.<br/>
<br/>
And if you have touched poison oak inadvertantly, or think you have, <br/>
I heard of a "temporary" quick fix that might help reduce the chances <br/>
of actually getting it.  Generally, the oil from poison oak needs to <br/>
be in contact with your skin for at least a small period of time <br/>
before you'll "get" poison oak, and the quicker you can wash it off, <br/>
the less likely it'll get you, or at least the lesser the severity.  <br/>
I don't know if this really works or not, but I figured it can't <br/>
hurt, and there's a certain amount of logic to it.<br/>
<br/>
What you do, wet down the area with water (you do have plenty of <br/>
water on your hikes, right?) you suspect may have been in contact <br/>
with poison oak.  Then rub dirt into it.  Poison oak excreets an oil, <br/>
and water alone isn't going to get it off.  You know the saying about <br/>
trying to mix water and oil.  But the oil is supposed to cling to the <br/>
dirt pretty well, and when you rinse the dirt off with more water, <br/>
it'll take the oils with it.  Kind of an improvised soap, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
But like I said, I don't really know the validity of whether this <br/>
would work or not, but as long as you don't rub your skin raw with <br/>
the dirt, I figure it can't hurt to try it in a pinch!  But then, <br/>
I've never gotten poison oak before, and I know I've touched it <br/>
plenty of times.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I've never tried that gimmick either.  I may be allergic <br/>
to poison oak, but I've never gotten a dose big enough to cause <br/>
problems yet!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>

I can't go by "leaves of 3,let them be"-  I usually get caught before any leaves come out.  I think all of those itchy plants have it out for me.  It is a good suggestion to wash anything that comes in contact with the plant.  Better safe than sorry.<br/>

We were on some really narrow single track trails (some of which were little more than spot where the plants on the trail were shorter than the ones off the trails) and there must have been some hanging into the trail.  The weird thing is that most of the spots are on the back of my legs.  I can't figure out how I got them there unless I backed into it.<br/>
<br/>
Our shoes and clothes are sitting in isolation in the garage due to a tick sighting.  I will make sure that I wash them.<br/>
