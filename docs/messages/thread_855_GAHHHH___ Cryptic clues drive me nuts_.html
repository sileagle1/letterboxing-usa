I think the cryptic clues, especially the good ones, are written with <br/>
a wink and a smile, and that when I do puzzle one out it's that much <br/>
more rewarding. So I'm with you: they drive me nuts, but they give me <br/>
something to chew on in the background while I'm going through the <br/>
daily routine in my "real" world, and I hope to see more coming <br/>
online with this new year's spring fever and the expanding number of <br/>
boxers gleefully sneaking around in the woods. I've found the best <br/>
revenge is to plant one myself. And, the couple I have found, I've <br/>
been able to "research" completely from Yahoo to decipher out the <br/>
obscurity. Go for one!<br/>

I feel your pain!  I've tried some of the mystery boxes with varied <br/>
success.  I'm making progress on some, totally stumped on others, but <br/>
I think that's what makes these special.<br/>
<br/>
You might try a direct appeal (off-list) to the owner.  They might be <br/>
more willing to give a little hint, or they might not.<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried Tom Cooch's Kimball Letterbook which can be reached via<br/>
http://www.webring.org/cgi-bin/webring?ring=lboxring;list<br/>
<br/>
You can do the whole thing on the web...<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you really want to find some, and maybe feel a little <br/>
isolated in your neck of the woods since there may not be any boxes <br/>
to find near you.  Don't despair!  We seem to be growing nicely, and <br/>
if you put some boxes out in your area, that should attract some <br/>
letterboxers, who hopefully will hide some boxes as well.  You could <br/>
also see if you can get jay and his clan to come out for the <br/>
weekend! :)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

Mornin', John! My 15 year old figured out "Ray's Dilemma" (under <br/>
the "?" on the Connecticut map at the home page) by surfing the <br/>
keywords on Yahoo. It's a really fun box to find! It does take a <br/>
little local knowledge as well, but there are a surprising number of <br/>
personal stamps in the book.<br/>
<br/>
The other one we've found doesn't <br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;at LEAST give a STARTING POINT?<br/>
&gt; Even something like... "start in FLORIDA".... or... "all these <br/>
&gt;clues <br/>
&gt; are from Sherlock Holmes books".... <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
so I'd be afraid that mentioning it wouldn't be fair to the owner. We <br/>
do think, however, that like Susan we're hot on the trail of Merlin's <br/>
Pre-Columbian Mystery, and hope to be stamping up there someday, if <br/>
we can swing the trip to the ----unsaid---- location.<br/>

Merlin's has been the most rewarding letterbox for me to date. I did <br/>
drive many hours to a location I thought was the right one, only to <br/>
find it was not the right location (or the right state.) But a few <br/>
weeks later I was all-the-more compensated.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it is possible to give folks the opportunity to check <br/>
their deductions on-line, without allowing the possibility of <br/>
persistent guessing giving it away. For example, I think it would be <br/>
hard to verify the correctness of the trivia questions for Cadillac <br/>
Mountain (using the on-line "check your answers" that is provided) by <br/>
random guessing. I doubt, however, that there is a feasible method of <br/>
allowing someone to check the state in which the quest starts - or <br/>
even the state park. Those are finite (even in Connecticut).<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I think the clues for the few mystery boxes out there are <br/>
fine as they stand.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Even something like... "start in FLORIDA".... or... "all these clues <br/>
&gt; &gt; are from Sherlock Holmes books".... at least we would know if we have <br/>
&gt; &gt; a CHANCE of ever finding the dang thing.<br/>

&gt; Actually, I like the fact that the starting point is ambigious.  Some sort<br/>
&gt; of checking scheme would be nice (to eliminate being in the wrong<br/>
&gt; state.)  Perhaps something like, "Enter_the_name_of_the_state_park".html<br/>
&gt; would be useful for those who wish to have the verification.<br/>
<br/>
I personally would not usually consider doing this.  Clues can be written<br/>
to verify themselves to those who truly solve them (as opposed to those<br/>
who "think" they have :-)); I call it the "ah experience" which I sometimes<br/>
try to weave into clues to have the same effect.  Its more fun that way.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, confidence is a big part of the game in some styles of clues.<br/>
It weeds out the true problem solver from the wannabe; you need to be <br/>
pretty sure you've got the right insight before driving off to state X<br/>
or following a trail for 5 miles, or else be bold, persistent or just <br/>
plain willing to take big chances to bag big fishes.  Such an online<br/>
verification scheme would lower the bar in these regards; its a lot <br/>
different being _sure_ or not that state X is right before driving <br/>
300 miles, and IMO, lower the cachet of these sorts of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, there are plenty of different styles of clues out there for <br/>
people of all interests to hopefully find something they like.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Not for me though, considering that I just started research on "Merlin's<br/>
&gt; Pre-columbian," and the research itself is very exciting.  Randy, I wish I<br/>
&gt; knew how you came up with this stuff, it is great!!! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks.  I wish I had time to do more, because they are fun to do.  I hope <br/>
to do a couple more this season, though ...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Speaking of mystery boxes and Randy :)   I went back to the Eastern <br/>
&gt; Shore MD box, and I really think you should check on it.  The area took<br/>
&gt; extensive flood damage, and it seems part of your clue is no longer there. <br/>
<br/>
That's unfortunate.  I'll let the list know when I check on it, but right <br/>
now its the middle of the sport orienteering season so it may be a while.<br/>
I have gotten better at hiding boxes in secure locations with zero chance of<br/>
accidental discovery and in working backwards from the box location when<br/>
writing<br/>
the clues, but that was an early box, and sometimes the clue dictates where <br/>
the box needs to go and it isn't always possible to do this.<br/>
