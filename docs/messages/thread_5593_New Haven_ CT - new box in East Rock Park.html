mentioned last night that he hadn't seen any mention of LBs in <br/>
East Rock Park, and I've had this idea for this series since <br/>
March, so we assembled it today.  Correct me if we're wrong about <br/>
this being the only box in East Rock!  Also, correct me if I'm <br/>
posting anything wrongly, as it's my first time writing <br/>
directions and the like.<br/>

The Alchemist's Series: Mercury<br/>
placed by Cobalt Nine on 1 June 2002<br/>
East Rock Park, New Haven, CT<br/>
<br/>
Mercury, one of the most common alchemical substances, was chosen <br/>
for the first in my series of Alchemy Letterboxes.  Mercury can <br/>
symbolise communication and inventiveness; as a result, we've <br/>
communicated these directions as clearly as possible, and we <br/>
chose the peak in New Haven's East Rock Park named for local <br/>
inventor Eli Whitney.  On this short (less than 1.5 hrs, <br/>
estimated) trip we endeavoured not to be too mercurial in our <br/>
choices and only changed trails once.<br/>
<br/>
[Mapquest directions from I-95 South; find other directions, if <br/>
you need them, by entering in the destination 'Livingston Ave and <br/>
Cold Spring Street, New Haven, CT'<br/>
<br/>
Merge onto I-95 S.<br/>
Take the I-91 N exit- exit number 48- towards HARTFORD.<br/>
(right-hand lane over the bridge)<br/>
Merge LEFT onto I-91 N.<br/>
Get into the LEFT lane, take exit #6 (it's a left-hand exit, <br/>
tricky little thing) 'Willow Street'.<br/>
<br/>
Turn RIGHT onto WILLOW ST. <br/>
Turn RIGHT onto LIVINGSTON ST.]<br/>
<br/>
The park will be ahead and to your right; Livingston here has <br/>
some big turn-of-the-century New England houses.<br/>
<br/>
Park along Livingston Street, between Cold Spring Street and East <br/>
Rock Road. If you're unfamiliar with the area, there's a map <br/>
posted in the park near the corner of Livingston Street and Cold <br/>
Spring street, and maps are probably available at the ranger <br/>
station, past the basketball courts and playground (near the <br/>
corner of Cold Spring Street and Orange Street).<br/>
<br/>
Walk north along the path through the grassy area until you reach <br/>
East Rock Road. Turn right onto the sidewalk on East Rock Road, <br/>
and cross the bridge over Mill River. At the intersection with <br/>
Farnam Road, enter the trail system onto the white rectangle <br/>
trail -- take a left at the intersection so that you're heading <br/>
north along the white rectangle trail.  Walk on the trail along <br/>
the river. When the trail forks, take the upwards-sloping right <br/>
fork. Keep following the white rectangle trail --  you'll cross a <br/>
paved street once. Just as the trail meets the paved street a <br/>
second time, there should be an intersection with the blue <br/>
rectangle trail. Take a left onto the blue rectangle trail.<br/>
<br/>
The blue trail will continue up a rocky climb to the small <br/>
Whitney Peak.  Near the summit, headed up the trail at a bearing <br/>
of 330, with a rock wall to your right, there will come a place <br/>
where the path heading 330 degrees makes a hairpin turn to about <br/>
85 degrees.  To the north will be the end of the stone wall and <br/>
ahead will be some very large boulders.  At the point where the <br/>
trail turns from 330 to 85, face straight ahead at a bearing of <br/>
310 degrees to see a healthy sloping tree.  It slopes from its <br/>
roots to your left (SW) to above the boulders up the slope (NE) <br/>
on your right.  Stand under this tree, going just a few steps off <br/>
the trail at 310.  Go 2 or 3 steps further in this direction from <br/>
under the tree.   Turn right, at 70 degrees, and find the Mercury <br/>
Letterbox wedged between two rocks.<br/>
<br/>
After you've found the letterbox, you can keep heading up to <br/>
Whitney Peak -- it's a 300' elevation just up the trail. At the <br/>
intersection of the blue rectangle and blue circle/triangle <br/>
trails, take a left turn to get to the peak. It's not very <br/>
exciting -- just a few big rocks, really -- but it allows a nice <br/>
view of the surrounding hillsides and of the main peak's 365' <br/>
elevation.<br/>
