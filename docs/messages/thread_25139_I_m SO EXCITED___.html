Welcome to Letterboxing.  It is a great and ADDICTING pasttime.  I too became instantly fascinated and have not stopped since.  Letterboxing.org and Atlasquest.com are the two best sites to learn about letterboxing, get clues, and talk to other enthusiasts.  Read up on gatherings/events in your area and go to one, where you will meet alot of great people and get some great stamps.  Enjoy!!!<br/>
