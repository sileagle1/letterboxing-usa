maybe one of you veteran Lbxrs would kindly enlighten me. I've been<br/>

letterbox, and I don't put them in the boxes that I hide.  But a couple<br/>
boxes that I have found did have ink pads in them.  I would say it's up to<br/>
you.  I think it's always smart, when you go letteboxing, to bring an ink<br/>
pad, because you never know if you'll need it!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think generally, most lboxers don't include an ink pad in the box.<br/>
<br/>
I can think of several reasons not to:<br/>
* Keep the cost down<br/>
* Extreme weather condition for some of our more remote boxes<br/>
* Possibility of an incredible mess were the box to get water inside<br/>
<br/>
While we've tried not to have any rules, it's been my impression that the general accepted letterbox would not include an ink pad.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if someone decided to include one, I cannot imagina nayone would be upset about it, but don't feel any need to include it.<br/>
<br/>
I could see a case made for including an ink pad in a "special occassion" box, that might not be left out permanently, and which might be accessed as part of an event where seekers are not necessarily prepared, although I've come to believe everyone travels with a notebook, inkpad, rubber stamps, and X-acto knife wherever they go.  Am I wrong????<br/>
<br/>
OOOps, I think I just argued both sides of the issue...<br/>

Speaking for myself only: I've not wanted to deal with the question of<br/>
cold weather (freezing, etc.), plus, individual choice of the finder as<br/>
to colors(s), quality of ink and pad, etc.  Easy to justify a decision<br/>
NOT to include a pad. But, as always,its your choice to include one if<br/>
you want, not likely a breach of ethics not to. IMHO<br/>

You know, Cara, I have no idea!  I've never tasted the raw sap.  My landlord's <br/>
family taps maples up and down my road and I try to take note of when they do it <br/>
each year.  Two years ago, the buckets appeared on Feb. 22, but last year I <br/>
neglected to write it down.<br/>
<br/>
Once the sugaring season starts you can go to sugar shacks, have pancakes, and <br/>
watch the sap being boiled.  The syrup produced in the first couple of weeks is <br/>
light amber and has a more delicate flavor than the later medium amber syrup. <br/>
It's known as "liquid gold."<br/>

There is NOTHING like being in a sugarbush (stand of maple trees) in the<br/>
a.m., just before the sun comes out, and when it does, little 'plink<br/>
plink' sounds start up all around you....<br/>
<br/>
Ummm, yup, you can taste it, slightly, from the bucket. If you ever get<br/>
the chance, try 'sugar on snow', that is, syrup boiled a litte thicker<br/>
and dumped out on fresh snow to cool - yummy. My old Vermont grandmother<br/>
used to, when the sweetness got to be too much, ate a sour pickel and<br/>
started again. Yup again, it works.<br/>
