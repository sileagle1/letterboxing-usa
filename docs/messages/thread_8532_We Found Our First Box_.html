we found out first box!  We went to Baker's Meadow in Andover, MA <br/>
and found the Busy Beavers Box!  We had tried it two weeks ago and <br/>
took a wrong turn on the trail and got totally discouraged.  Today, <br/>
we are glowing from ear to ear!  It was a beautiful hike and the <br/>
finding of the box was quite a challenge for us.  What a feeling <br/>
when I caught a glimpse of it!  I was in shock and just sorta stared <br/>
at it before calling my husband over.  What a wonderful hobby.  <br/>
Thanks to all who helped us when we were so bummed  two weeks back.  <br/>
We have learned alot from this board.<br/>

finally did!  As long as I know the box is there,  it will bug me <br/>
until I find it!  Have fun.  I am new to this too and LOVE it!<br/>
