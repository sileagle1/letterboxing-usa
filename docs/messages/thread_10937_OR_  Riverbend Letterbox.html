                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was a lovely afternoon and John and I headed out to Oxbow Park.  We<br/>
had already gotten Kara's Oxbow #1 letterbox ages ago, and, of course,<br/>
her Oxbow #2 is missing. <br/>
<br/>
Funhog had placed the Riverbend Letterbox in this park a while back and<br/>
we decided to check it out.  Only three people besides us have checked<br/>
it out.  Tammy, Jason and a baby footprint stamp.  The clues are<br/>
excellent and the stamp is wonderful (we would expect nothing less from<br/>
the happy hog!)  <br/>
<br/>
Oxbow is an excellent park.  Way beautiful with tons of letterboxing<br/>
potential.  We may have to place some letterboxes there ourselves one of<br/>
these days.  <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile...I'm working on a new stamp for a letterbox for a<br/>
newly-discovered state park we stumbled upon this past weekend.  Found<br/>
the perfect spot for the letterbox, just need to get the masterpiece<br/>
completely in rubber and head out that way again and viola!  It will be<br/>
another one of those boxes that takes you to a pretty cool park.  I'll<br/>
keep y'all posted when it gets placed.<br/>
<br/>
