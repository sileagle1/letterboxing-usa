<br/>
As Mrs Jiggs is fresh out of the hospital, the rest of Clan Jiggs <br/>
decided yo get caught up on some boxing ion the Nor Cal area this <br/>
weekend! <br/>
<br/>
Here's what we found on our travels...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Duck in the Park - Yuba City - found in great shape, with a few <br/>
visitors - great to see the box of a new LBer in this area get some <br/>
traffic! Oh yeah, nice of Doubles AJ to mention us in the Log!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cupid's Arrow - Davis - another great Doubles AJ box in a really <br/>
neat setting! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In N Out - Davis - definitely toast - this was a very popular, and <br/>
extra-tasty LB that will me missed!<br/>
<br/>
All Flavor of Beans - Fairfield - still there and well-visited! Book <br/>
getting pretty full! Thorns remembered my hands from the last time - <br/>
ouch!!!<br/>
<br/>
Boxer Family Series - Richmond - we started this sseries back in Sep <br/>
at the NorCal gathering, but never got past #1 - til now! Sooo....<br/>
<br/>
#1, 2, 3 and 4 in great shape!<br/>
<br/>
#5 is okay, but the box was full of water, and the logbook was <br/>
pretty damp. We cleaned things up as best we could, and replanted <br/>
the box in the same area, but out of the water.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting to note that we were the first visitors since the Coyote <br/>
Clan on Sep 27th! That's a shame, because this is a fun (albeit <br/>
demanding) series!<br/>
<br/>
Itchy and Scratchy - Richmond - #1 (Itchy) in super shape.<br/>
#2 (Scratchy) - Toast, as advertised.<br/>
<br/>
No Speed Zone - Richmond - Both boxes are fine! Picked up the Zed LB <br/>
HH at #2!<br/>
<br/>
Take a Hike - Richmond - sad to say this box has something in common <br/>
with Jimmy Hoffa - both are encased in cement! The hole in the tree <br/>
where the box was housed has been filled in with some sort of <br/>
plaster sealing compound. I'm assuming the box was either sealed <br/>
with it (if memory serves me, this was a microbox) or has otherwise <br/>
disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
Survivor: The Amazon Series - Oakland<br/>
<br/>
Box 1: Great condition!<br/>
<br/>
Box 2: Uh-oh...this box was completely filled with water - inside <br/>
the Ziplock bag, inside another ziplock bag!  The stamp was in <br/>
another waterlogged bag. The Log book, however, was fairly dry!  We <br/>
drained everything, dried as best we could, and replanted in a spot <br/>
almost as per the original spot.<br/>
<br/>
Box 3: Missing. - at least we couldn't find it based on the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Box 4: Great condition right were it was supposed to be!<br/>
<br/>
So there you have it!<br/>
<br/>
Total - 10 new boxes - 4 attempts and 1 more HH!<br/>

Whoa!  I hope I run across THAT hitchhiker somewhere sometime.  And <br/>
if you left it in that same general area, I just might.  My daughter <br/>
lives in Oakland and in fact I'll be out there April 10-17.  We hope <br/>
to do at least a little boxing while I'm there...<br/>
