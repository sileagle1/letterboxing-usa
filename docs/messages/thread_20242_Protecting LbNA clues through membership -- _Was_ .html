Should we knock twice, turn around four times, and then shake your bootie or<br/>
is it turn around four times......? With the increasing number of members,<br/>
it will of course increase the number of missing or damaged box. That's just<br/>
the law of averages. For the most part this is just a sweet game with<br/>
loving, caring, artistic and sometimes overly enthusiastic, careless people.<br/>
Yes, a lot of time, energy, creativity and love went into these boxes and<br/>
the thought of losing any of them is a tragedy but to stoop to this level?<br/>
You don't think that someone that is determined to destroy boxes couldn't<br/>
figure out how to get a password? Think about all the people how would miss<br/>
out on the enjoyment of this game.  Rules, we would start to have rules.<br/>
When you get to rule number 127 go back to rule number 1, NO RULES?!?<br/>
