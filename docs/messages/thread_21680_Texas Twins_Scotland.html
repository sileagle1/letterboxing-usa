Hi, <br/>
I'm looking for the Texas Twins Letterboxers. I found that they have <br/>
placed 3 letterboxes in Scotland, and when I try to go to the clue <br/>
sheets a web site for Imaginet comes up. There is nothing mentioned <br/>
about letterboxing. My guess is that they are in or from Texas(DUH!)so <br/>
if any letterboers from the BIG state know them or their whereabouts <br/>
please let me know. <br/>
