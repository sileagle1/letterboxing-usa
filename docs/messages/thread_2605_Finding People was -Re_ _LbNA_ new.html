This brings up an issue I have been working on addressing. How to <br/>
find letterboxers in someone's local area. If you go to the <br/>
Letterboxing International site you will see topic areas for <br/>
Letterboxers US, Letterboxers UK, and Letterboxers Other. Anyone can <br/>
use the the "contribute news/info" link to add a listing for <br/>
themselves. When you get to the form make sure you choose the <br/>
appropriate area from the pull down menu (e.g. letterboxers US) and <br/>
_please_ somewhere in your listing include your city and state. That <br/>
will allow others to easily find you. When someone sees your listing <br/>
they can send you an email from the website, but your email address <br/>
(as you listed it when you entered your info) is NOT available for <br/>
others to see (i.e. cannot be harvested for spam). If you go there <br/>
you will see listings for a few of us. Everyone is welcome to create <br/>
a listing. There is a slight delay before your listing will be seen, <br/>
as I need to approve all listings to avoid inappropriate listings <br/>
(spam, profanity, etc..). Everyone is welcome to have a listing for <br/>
themselves.<br/>
