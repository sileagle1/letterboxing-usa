I almost afraid to tell you this.  Log onto AtlasQuest.com and select <br/>
"Boards", then "Categories", then "Letterbox Central", then "Postal <br/>
Letterboxes".  In fact, select "Boards" then "Favorite Boards" and <br/>
sign up for that board.  You'll be up to your eyeballs in postals in <br/>
a New York minute, and we'll never hear from you again!<br/>
<br/>
You might want to know that many of those members consider postals an <br/>
opportunity to carve large stamps, larger than you'll typically find <br/>
in a regular letterbox.  There have been a couple that were carved <br/>
from an entire sheet of PZ Kut, which is 10" x 4.75".<br/>

Letterboxing for the infirm and homebound.  The box arrives in your <br/>
mailbox, you stamp in, then ship it off to somewhere else.  No need <br/>
to ever put on your hiking boots or put gas in the car.  You can find <br/>
better descriptions on AtlasQuest.com.<br/>
<br/>
In the original incarnation, you'd ship it back to the owner.  <br/>
Nowadays, though, a "ring" is popular where you ship it on to the <br/>
next guy in the ring, until it makes it around and back to the owner.<br/>

addictive.  <br/>
<br/>
They are for anyone.  <br/>
<br/>
Pick a theme/catagory/idea and see who is interested in creating a <br/>
stamp and logbook.  I prefer when each member of the ring knows who <br/>
all is in it but only has one address. <br/>
<br/>
The ring leader sets a start date.  On that date everyone mails <br/>
their own Postal Lb to the one address they have, then when they <br/>
receive one they stamp just like finding one in the wild and again <br/>
mail to their one address.  When you receive yours back, the ring <br/>
has completed and you can retire the Lb or plant it in the wild.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we can do things we wouldn't normally do for 'wild' <br/>
plants.  Like include a tape/cd with 'must listen to' music or <br/>
swap...something, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, that's probably a dime rather than two cents, but like I said, <br/>
love 'em and they're addictive...that's my story and I'm stickin' to <br/>
it.<br/>

On a side note, there was some erroneous info on postals in another <br/>
post.  A postal travels from person to person via snailmail, <br/>
eventually returning to the creator.  A ring is where several people <br/>
create postals and these boxes are sent around the ring int he same <br/>
fashion, with everybody eventually seeing all of them and then the <br/>
originals returning to their owner.  Sometimes the PLB's disappear <br/>
into 'black holes' as people do not send them on, but this is rare.<br/>
<br/>
AQ is also a resource as well.<br/>

They are for anyone. <br/>
<br/>
Pick a theme/catagory/idea and see who is interested in creating a <br/>
stamp and logbook. I prefer when each member of the ring knows who <br/>
all is in it but only has one address. <br/>
<br/>
The ring leader sets a start date. On that date everyone mails <br/>
their own Postal Lb to the one address they have, then when they <br/>
receive one they stamp just like finding one in the wild and again <br/>
mail to their one address. When you receive yours back, the ring <br/>
has completed and you can retire the Lb or plant it in the wild.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we can do things we wouldn't normally do for 'wild' <br/>
plants. Like include a tape/cd with 'must listen to' music or <br/>
swap...something, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, that's probably a dime rather than two cents, but like I said, <br/>
love 'em and they're addictive...that's my story and I'm stickin' to <br/>
it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Sparky Butterfly!<br/>
<br/>
  I haven't been reading this chain until now, but wanted to put in my 2 cents about postal letterboxes.  The first time I became aware of postal letterboxes was several years ago when a friend of mine received the coolest PLB that she received.  It was a piece of Aztec gold (carved) and wrapped in a piece of leather.  There was also a treasure chest filled with "jewels" and coins of chocolate.  The logbook was extravagant as well looking somewhat "Pirate-like."  Since then, I've viewed PLBs as an arrival of entertainment - a package complete with a theme - logbook and carving to wow the recipient.<br/>
<br/>
  I was a crafter before I was a letterboxer and also love the Lord of the Rings.  I made several boxes and asked the PLBing community to answer questions about LOTRs so that just those who were interested would participate.  I learned that some people do not move the boxes along as quickly as others or boxes would end up in "black holes" - those people who are having some sort of problem and don't mail them out at all.  (By the way, the Aztec Gold box went missing eventually.)  <br/>
<br/>
  Being part of PLBing means that you must be prepared that there's a possibility your box will get lost.  This can happen if the box is planted in the wild too.  Out of the 5 Lord of the Rings boxes - 2 went missing.  Out of the 60 boxes or so that I planted in the wild, 1 went missing.  I feel a lot safer planting my boxes then mailing them.  I put the same effort in my "wild"boxes as I would in a PLB.  I like to entertain my audience.<br/>
<br/>
  Another point is that the new postal rates have increased the cost of PLBing significantly.  Good advice was given - try it out with a few boxes before you get in over your head.  <br/>
<br/>
  Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
  Enjoy!<br/>
  donutz716<br/>
<br/>
  P.S. - I have never gotten a PLB with a stamp the size of a sheet of PZ cut - Thank God!  It would not fit in my logbook...  <br/>

&gt;   Being part of PLBing means that you must be prepared that there's a<br/>
&gt;   possibility your box will get lost.  This can happen if the box is<br/>
&gt;   planted in the wild too.  Out of the 5 Lord of the Rings boxes - 2<br/>
&gt;   went missing.  Out of the 60 boxes or so that I planted in the wild,<br/>
&gt;   1 went missing.  I feel a lot safer planting my boxes then mailing<br/>
&gt;   them.<br/>
<br/>
Wow.  I would not have expected that.  I would have expected that a <br/>
lost PLB would be a rare thing indeed.  I wouldn't expect the USPS to <br/>
lose more than one out of a thousand.  And I wouldn't expect anyone <br/>
who actually signs up for a PLB to somehow lose it while it's in <br/>
their possession.  What do you think happened to the two PLB's that <br/>
went missing?<br/>
<br/>
I hate to even suggest that any letterboxers might be less than <br/>
honest, but is there any possibility that a boxer just decided to <br/>
keep a box?  And if this ever happens, is there a way to blacklist <br/>
these people so nobody sends them any more PLB's?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">PLBs can go missing for a number of reasons.  If someone has a major <br/>
life event -- serious illness, family emergency, etc. -- postals in <br/>
their possession might not be mailed back out.  Occasionally someone <br/>
gets in over their head and signs up for too many rings, then can't <br/>
afford the postage to mail the boxes back out.  The PLB community has <br/>
been great in these situations, with several folks offering to retrieve <br/>
and mail the boxes back to their owners.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, the USPS does lose or misdirect boxes on occasion too.  My <br/>
neighborhood does not have traditional mailboxes in front of each <br/>
house.  Rather, we have postal units on each street corner similar to <br/>
an apartment complex.  Several months ago, our postal carrier <br/>
accidently put a PLB addressed to me into the box of someone a couple <br/>
of streets away... same house number, but different street.  It took <br/>
that person a couple of weeks before he decided to bring me the <br/>
package.  In the meantime, the delivery confirmation showed the box as <br/>
being delivered.  I was horrified that I would be considered a "black <br/>
hole", but had no explanation until the neighbor showed up with the <br/>
box.  Stuff happens!<br/>
