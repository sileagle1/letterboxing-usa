5 boxes planted Labor Day weekend in the Belgrade Lakes, Maine area. <br/>
If anyone wants these clues email me and I'll fill you in.<br/>
<br/>
Also I will be placing two new boxes in Charlotte County, Southwest<br/>
Florida this comming weekend.  They will be the first two boxes in<br/>
that county.  Think Venice and Manasota Key.  Email and I'll provide<br/>
you with the directions once they are placed.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps anyone in those two areas who are looking to box until<br/>
the site is back up and going.<br/>
