his impending arrival that our newest forest frog, Owen William <br/>
Seftor, made his entrance on Thursday, May 22nd at 12:30 pm (a full <br/>
two weeks late!)  If you'd like to see pictures, you can check out <br/>

15456, or visit http://seftor.com/owen  <br/>
<br/>
We can't wait to get him out on the trails with us, once I heal and <br/>
the rain stops falling!  I've really missed letterboxing these past <br/>
few months.  But other than needing to take it easy, baby and I are <br/>
doing just fine. :)  Hope to see you DC-area boxers soon!<br/>
