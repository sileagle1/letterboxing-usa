webmaster@letterboxing.org about the problem boxes.  You might want to<br/>
put something like "problem link", or "broken link" in the subject<br/>
line.  I think it's something the webmasters are unaware of on other<br/>
boxes and would appreciate knowing about.  It's such a big website and<br/>
it just amazes me how well it runs and the few kinks I've come across. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
