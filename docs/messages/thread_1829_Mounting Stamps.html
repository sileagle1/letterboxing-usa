<p>We had some conversations over the holiday about 
stamp mounting and glues for mounting. I am also on the Carving Consortium 
eList and back in December learned about "Superstick". It is a double sided high 
density foam sheet. I had been trying 1" wide foam tape, but then had to piece 
it across a 2" wide stamp. </p>
<p>I just mounted my first stamps with it and WOW 
does it work great. When I use the Red Speedball carving medium, which is about 
1/4 thick to start, thin, double sided tape works pretty good, because it acts 
like it's own cushion. When I use the laser engraved rubber, which is .085 
thick, the foam cushion works the best.  I am spoiled with access to the 
laser engraver and as Squirrel can attest, it does a really nice, store bought 
quality stamp. I pull clipart off the web or scan art and or logos out of 
magazines to create the stamp image with Photo Shop.</p>
<p>The next thing I will try is using 3/8 or 1/2 wood backs instead of 3/4, 
Superstick cushion and speedball hand carved stamps.  I will also try and 
put some photos of the finished stamps on my web sight</p>
<p>For you that are going the next step and mounting your hand carved stamps, 
you might want to try SUPERSTICK</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubberpoet.com/PigAccessories.html">http://www.rubberpoet.com/PigAccessories.html</a></p>
<p><b>Superstick</b>(tm) is our regular cushion. Black, high density, 8 
pound, 1/8" foam with very aggressive adhesive. Sold in 9x12" sheets for $3 postpaid. This is 
the stuff that the Poet has milled to his own strict specifications by a defense 
contractor who now has excess capacity, thanks to the peacetime dividend. So 
keep buying stamps from us and we'll keep one defense contractor from reverting 
back to their old trade of mass death and destruction.</p>

Congrats on carving your first stamp, Ru.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, some of the conflicting advise you have been getting may<br/>
come from people who have not carved their own stamps, but do have<br/>
experience with comercially produced unmount rubber stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Those kind of machine made stamps quite often are made of a very thin<br/>
valcanized rubber material. They will give their best impression if<br/>
they have some kind of "cushion" to work with. (Either between the<br/>
stamp and the wood/mounting surface or under the paper being stamped<br/>
on.)<br/>
<br/>
Most of the materials used for carving letterbox stamps are<br/>
sufficently thick that they don't need any cushion. However, they<br/>
will last longer and be easier to use if you do mount them.<br/>
<br/>
I have a few stamps mounted to the thick style of fun foam. They've<br/>
been "out there" for several months and so far are holding up well.<br/>
Using the fun foam was an idea I got from someone on this list.<br/>
<br/>
However, the material I most often use to mount my stamps to is<br/>
posterboard. I have a stamp mounting tutorial, with photos, at our<br/>
picture trail site. www.picturetrail.com/bindle_boxers<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

plexiglass, the 1/8" inch thick stuff is easy to score with a mat <br/>
knife and snap over the edge of a work bench... a corner-rounder <br/>
picked up a tagsale makes it even more streamlined.  You can even <br/>
heat transfer your original image to the back of the rubber stamp <br/>
material before gluing the plexiglass down, for a professional look.  <br/>
We are using regular old crazy glue to bond the rubber to the <br/>
plexiglass with good results.  Best, is these wont warp in our new <br/>
england winters (if they dont fall apart!) and they are nice and thin <br/>
to fit in our favorite streamlined rubbermaids!<br/>

I always mount my stamps on wood.  It seems to help give a better stamped image since I can apply equal pressure all over the stamp.  I use Speedball's "Pink Stuff" and mount dirrectly to a piece of wood.  I use E600 glue, that stuff sticks to anything, and I haven't had any problems with warping my stamps.  After I glue, I place the stamp, stamp side down, and place a paperweight on it while it dries.  Result, a nice sturdy stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.<br/>
