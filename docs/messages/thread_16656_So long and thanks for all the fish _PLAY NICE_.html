<br/>
I have received over a dozen emails today just saying "hey Pandy is <br/>
the board always like this? If so how do I unsubscribe?"  I'm asking <br/>
please, all of you, take the personal attacks, the flames and the <br/>
arguments to private emails; please do not continue it on the board.  <br/>
There is no need for it  People here are adults and they can take <br/>
care of and stick up for themselves, nobody else need be the hero.  <br/>
Furthermore the display being put on here by slapping back and forth <br/>
at each other is only a mirror image of the behavior that started <br/>
this problem to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
I'm personally tired of beating the dead horse  Ya'll need to play <br/>
nice or ignore each other and don't play at all  but either way, no <br/>
more flames or personal arguments and attacks on the board please.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
