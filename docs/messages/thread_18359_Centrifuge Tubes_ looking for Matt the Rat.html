Back to the centrifuge tubes...specimen cups would also be a good option...a<br/>
larger diameter for a little more flexibility.  I believe they hold 200-250<br/>
mL, depending on vendor.  Stay with an all-plastic model....<br/>
<br/>
PS:  I've heard from the Trouts and M&amp;K concerning their boxes (sorry again<br/>
for duplicate posts), but no word from Matt.  Hey, ya out there???  (busy<br/>
Lbing instead of reading email??)  I need to know about that box!!!<br/>

What a great idea!  We use these at work (a clinical lab) and they are<br/>
indeed sturdy...I can vouch for that. My one warning is if the caps get<br/>
screwed down TOO tight they will crack (the round top will separate from the<br/>
serrated sides).  Your price is very reasonable, too.<br/>

&gt; The little 50mm centrifuge tube micro-boxes came thru with flying colors.<br/>
I placed my order for a case and expect to see them in about 10 days. If<br/>
anyone wants to see what they look like I have some pictures with more<br/>
information here:<br/>
http://www.catbeadmischief.com/microbox.html  Some quick information: I<br/>
ordered the ones with a place to write on, so the cost will be higher at<br/>
<gasp> 2 for 29  plus shipping from me to you. Since this is my cost, there<br/>
will not be any sales tax for NY.  If anyone wants to give them a try,<br/>
contact me off list or follow the email link on the above page on my<br/>
website.<br/>
