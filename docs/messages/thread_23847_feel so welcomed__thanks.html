did.you'd know that my kids are my life.i live,breath and die for <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I for one have to wonder what makes you think you have the right to waltz in<br/>
and vent on folks you don't even know, and then expect them to not express<br/>
themselves in return in a calm and rational manner, which is what you got.<br/>
Believe me, the reaction you got was far kinder than I expected to see after<br/>
I read your initial post!<br/>
<br/>
If your job is to help people die, you should well know that a day spent<br/>
with your family, even if you came up 0-10 boxwise (instead of the<br/>
reasonably successful 6-10 you got), is NOT a day where your family's<br/>
valuable time has been wasted - instead, it was a wonderful investment of<br/>
time together as every day with family is precious.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry you had a bad day, but do you really want your first impression<br/>
anywhere in life to be that of someone who storms in ranting?<br/>
