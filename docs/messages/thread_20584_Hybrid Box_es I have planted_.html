We put them each in very differnent places, and the kids had a blast loading them and going back now and then to pick something.  I love reading the logs as well as seeing the stamps.  Our are in Southern NH and they work well, but I got the idea from some in suburban Detroit, where we moved to NH from.  I posted them on both websites with links to the other clues in each spot.<br/>

Has anyone had experience placing a hybrid letterbox/geocache? I'm particularly looking for hints on how to make it work.<br/>

I've tried both hobbies and don't really care much for geocaching myself but I'm thinking of placing a hybrid box to see how it goes. The directions would clearly state Take Nothing Leave Nothing, Sign Log (TNLNSL) to avoid people taking the stamp or leaving junk.<br/>
