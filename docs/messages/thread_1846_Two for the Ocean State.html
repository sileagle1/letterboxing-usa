<br/>
Two letterboxes in a stunning seaside setting. Difficulty: 3 miles of <br/>
beach slogging (worth every step) and  mile of resort town cottage <br/>
lanes. The hardest part of this hike may be finding parking in the <br/>
summer season (we suggest you come at sunrise and walk with the <br/>
locals before the summer hordes, or else park at the airport and bike <br/>
in).<br/>
<br/>
Watch Hill is the quintessential Rhode Island summer resort. Located <br/>
in the far south western corner of the state, arrive via I95 or Rte. <br/>
1 through Westerly.<br/>
<br/>
Begin near the famous carousel and walk westwards 1 miles out to the <br/>
end of Napatree Point, following the southern shore with Long Island <br/>
Sound on your left. At the tip of the point you'll come across an old <br/>
rocky jetty. Cut inland on shrubby overgrown trails to <br/>
discover...!!!...<br/>
<br/>
Explore and then continue northwest to a second, smaller discovery. <br/>
In the far northwest corner looking out over Little Narragansett Bay, <br/>
peek under the smooth sloping edge for the Napatree Point Letterbox. <br/>
(Sorry if the trails are much more overgrown in summer and fall than <br/>
they were when we planted the letterbox on a blustery winter day with <br/>
snow crunching underfoot.)<br/>
<br/>
Now return to the carousel and turn right, southeast, on the road. <br/>
Just up the hill, turn right at #2 onto a beautiful side street <br/>
between signs that say "Private Road, Walkers Welcome." Walk down to <br/>
the lighthouse, through the gate, and bear left for a clockwise tour <br/>
of the breakwater and the light. The rocky southern shore of the <br/>
point is easy walking. After you round the point and head back, the <br/>
shore is a little more broken up, but still makes for wonderful <br/>
beachcombing. Walking eastwards again, come across an old stone jetty <br/>
on your left that points 340 towards Napatree Point. Turning your <br/>
back on it, walk the reciprocal bearing, directly in line with the <br/>
jetty, to find the Watch Hill Light Letterbox under a flat piece of <br/>
ridged concrete. This spot, too, may get a little overgrown in summer.<br/>
<br/>
Now for a ride on that carousel!<br/>
