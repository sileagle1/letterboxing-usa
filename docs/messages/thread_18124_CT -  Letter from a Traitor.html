were at the New London / Groton,Ct Letter from a Traitor boxes. The <br/>
wind was blowing as she gave her guided tour that touched her very <br/>
much. We found both boxes in good shape with the exception of the log <br/>
book in Fort Trumbull which was full and boxers were stamping on the <br/>
lined side of the page as I confuse I did too. Great boxes!<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
