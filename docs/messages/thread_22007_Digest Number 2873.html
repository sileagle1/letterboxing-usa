This is a wonderful idea (birthday party to introduce the idea to the <br/>
children)! We homeschool as well!  We used foam craft sheets and the <br/>
children used one of their many stencils and traced on the shape/item they <br/>
wanted for their stamps.  Then I cut them out and Dad glued them onto some <br/>
scrap wood we have.  We found our first box on Mother's Day and we had a <br/>
wonderful time finding it (we are new to this group as well).  There are no <br/>
Letterboxes in our small town, so we plan to at least plant a couple here <br/>
locally.  I will be helping a couple of others in our homeschooling group <br/>
get started as well - and there is a lady in the group who has been <br/>
Letterboxing for several years, so we ask most of our questions of her at <br/>
the moment.<br/>
<br/>
The person who did the one we found at our local nature center has made the <br/>
most beautiful notebook cover for the box - I simply cannot even begin to <br/>
think how they made it - much more talented than we are, LOL!<br/>

what we do not see.<br/>
One person once asked George Washington if he thought God was on his <br/>
side.  His reply is reported to have been:  "It is not that God should be <br/>
on our side, but that we be on His.<br/>

&gt;Subject: idea for making own stamps/handmade journals/birthday party<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi, I am brand new to this Yahoo Group. I wanted to send this to the<br/>
&gt;letterboxing site but don't see a contact mail address to do that so<br/>
&gt;I will post this here and maybe someone can benefit from this<br/>
&gt;information.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I did one letterbox hike last summer with my children and another<br/>
&gt;family. I hope to do more family letterboxing hikes and I may even<br/>
&gt;place some letterboxes. I am so happy that so many letterboxes are in<br/>
&gt;my area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am also considering starting a letterboxing club for homeschooled<br/>
&gt;children, I homeschool my kids. This would be a way to get out in<br/>
&gt;nature and of course, have fun. It is nice with homeschooling, to<br/>
&gt;have the freedom in our schedule to hike 7 days per week, and during<br/>
&gt;regular "school days" such as great spring days and crisp autumn<br/>
&gt;days.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Making own stamps:<br/>
&gt;Thanks for the instructions on the site about making our own stamps.<br/>
&gt;I want to share an idea I came up with which is an adaptation of your<br/>
&gt;foot pad idea. I hope you share this idea on your website if you feel<br/>
&gt;it is worthwhile. You have my permission to share this idea and to<br/>
&gt;use any of my writing in order to put the information online.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After reading your directions, I intended to use the foot pads but<br/>
&gt;only could find one package/style that was not medicated! The non-<br/>
&gt;medicated pads were $3 for one pack (Dr. Sholl brand) and they were<br/>
&gt;weird oval shapes. I felt this was too expensive and didn't allow<br/>
&gt;enough options for designs.(There were about a dozen different shapes<br/>
&gt;in the medicated version.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had an idea to use regular craft foam sheets aka "foamies" instead.<br/>
&gt;These foam sheets may be purchased at any craft store or on the<br/>
&gt;internet. They are sold individually, with one 8.5"x11" sheet ranging<br/>
&gt;from 40 cents to 80 cents. They are also sold in packets, such as 40<br/>
&gt;sheets for under $4. These are more versatile than the foot pads as<br/>
&gt;they allow the person to cut out any shape they want and make the<br/>
&gt;stamp any size they want. I tested the foam sheets and they work fine<br/>
&gt;as stamps, both the very, very thin ones, and of course the sheets<br/>
&gt;that are thicker at 1/4 inch thick, work as well. These foam sheets<br/>
&gt;don't require peeling as some of the foot pads do, you just cut, glue<br/>
&gt;it on, and you are done.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here is an example of a foam sheet packet of 40, selling for $3.71:<br/>
&gt;http://www.createforless.com/products/productDetail.asp?<br/>
&gt;ProductID=86682&amp;GCID=C10601x061<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here is an example of one single foam sheet:<br/>
&gt;http://www.createforless.com/products/productDetail.asp?<br/>
&gt;ProductID=86680&amp;GCID=C10601x061<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Buckets and sheets of die cut shapes are also sold, such as basic<br/>
&gt;geometric shapes and even fancy holiday themed shapes. Some of these<br/>
&gt;even have peel-off backings with adhesive already on them, while<br/>
&gt;others require glue. These precut designs could be used with very<br/>
&gt;young children who are too young to use scissors and create their own<br/>
&gt;shapes. Buckets are inexpensive also at about $8 full retail or as<br/>
&gt;low as $5 on sale.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here is an example of a bucket of foam shapes.<br/>
&gt;http://www.joann.com/catalog.jhtml;$sessionid$DG4WPAQAAHOQ0P4SY5LRIHR5<br/>
&gt;0LD3UEPO?CATID=101939&amp;PRODID=96052<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The sheets tend to have the intricate holiday designs or a theme<br/>
&gt;(i.e. sea creatures). Here is an example of a 50 piece packet that<br/>
&gt;sells for just $2:<br/>
&gt;http://www.createforless.com/products/productDetail.asp?<br/>
&gt;ProductID=49663<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am using recycled wood scraps as the base, which I had purchased<br/>
&gt;(in the past and already had on hand), for a very low price at a<br/>
&gt;craft store, labeled as factory seconds pine wood scraps. The jar<br/>
&gt;lids I had were not flat because they had a vacuum seal style, which<br/>
&gt;is so common now, and it caused problems with uneven stamping when I<br/>
&gt;did a trial run. If jar lids are used perhaps you can suggest to make<br/>
&gt;sure the surface is entirely flat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Making your own blank journal book:<br/>
&gt;I also found a great site with instructions to make your own hardback<br/>
&gt;journal book, a small sized book. I adapted these directions by<br/>
&gt;omitting the spine and by using two signatures only as I felt these<br/>
&gt;young children didn't need a very thick journal, theirs is 44 pages.<br/>
&gt;If you follow these directions, the book would be 144 pages. Many<br/>
&gt;different recycled materials (paper, cardboard, wallpaper sample<br/>
&gt;books, old wrapping paper, etc.) may be used to make these journal<br/>
&gt;books.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Children's Birthday Party-Letterboxing:<br/>
&gt;Today I am hosting a letterboxing children's birthday party for my<br/>
&gt;son who is turning five years old. The 16 children, aged 2-8, will be<br/>
&gt;designing their own stamp at the clearing at the trailhead. I am<br/>
&gt;giving a small, inexpensive compass as a "gift" and will teach them<br/>
&gt;how to use it. They will each get their own journal book which as I<br/>
&gt;said before, I made by hand using some recycled materials. I will<br/>
&gt;teach them the "no trace" ethics protocol. They will hike and find<br/>
&gt;the letterboxes as a group (hiking with parents as well). We will<br/>
&gt;conclude by having cupcakes, picnic style, at the preserve's field.<br/>
&gt;Wish me luck!<br/>
