after about 6 mo. To test it, spray a bit into a styrofoam cup. If it<br/>
'melts' the cup, it's still good. It will usually clear your sinuses too!<br/>
After about a year, it both looses some of it's pressure (so it won't spray<br/>
as far) &amp; tends to 'evaporate' from the container, so that's probably why<br/>
you got nothing when you tried to use yours Detra.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend the book "The Gift of Fear - (subtitle- and other<br/>
survival signals that protect us from violence)" by Gavin DeBecker! I first<br/>
heard of it at a 'street survival' seminar given to law enforcement<br/>
personal. Everyone was raving about how good it was, &amp; that everyone should<br/>
buy one for everyone they love, so I bought it. They were right! The author<br/>
is very insightful and gives you a lot to think about. ISBN: 0-440-22619-8<br/>
(no I don't have any financial interest in this book :-) It was a #1<br/>
national best seller and says across the cover "This book can save your<br/>
life"<br/>
<br/>
I agree that life is no fun if you constantly worry about what is around the<br/>
bend (I spent about 9 years of my life feeling like I had a target painted<br/>
on me). Rather than worry about it, just know that you are as prepared as<br/>
you can be, and then you don't have to worry. If you go through life<br/>
thinking "it wouldn't happen to me" or "I'm not in that kind of<br/>
neighborhood", then you will just freeze or panic if something does happen -<br/>
have a plan. Crime happens to all walks of life, in all neighborhoods, to<br/>
all kinds of people. Please be prepared so you don't have to worry and you<br/>
are less likely to be a victim.<br/>

Again, stepping off my soap box :-)<br/>

&gt; I carried pepper spray in college and never tried to use it.  When<br/>
&gt; I was told that it would be nice to "try it out" so I would know how if<br/>
&gt; needed nothing sprayed out of the container! I was so glad I had never<br/>
needed it.<br/>

&gt; A book entitled The Gift of Fear has made me more<br/>
&gt; aware about paying attention to one's animal intuition about<br/>
&gt; potentially dangerous situations. I trust my instincts and relish my<br/>
&gt; freedom.<br/>
