<br/>
Sorry about that.  I've been vacationing for the last couple of weeks <br/>
and flying around the country (more literally than you can possibly <br/>
imagine, I might add).  But I'm back for a few days to liven things <br/>
up before I go off on more hair-brained adventures.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which....<br/>
<br/>
For those who don't know about it yet....<br/>
<br/>
I *love* to hike, and I'm itching to hit the trail.  For this year, <br/>
I'm thinking of something a little less ambitious than the <br/>
Appalachian Trail--the Wonderland Trail around Mount Rainier.  It's <br/>
allegedly one of the best trails to 'thru-hike' in the world--a 92 <br/>
mile fiesta of adventures.  =)<br/>
<br/>
And to make it more interesting, I decided to turn it into a fund <br/>
raiser with the Washington Trail Association's first-ever Hike-A-<br/>
Thon!  I've written up a page with all the details that you can find <br/>
at http://www.atlasquest.com/hikeathon/<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I'm hoping to raise $1,000 (or more!) to help Washington <br/>
state trails.  I've volunteered with them in the past clearing trails <br/>
and building trails, and they're a GREAT organization!  They get a <br/>
LOT done with the little funding they get.<br/>
<br/>
People can pledge a flat dollar amount (but what fun is that?), or a <br/>
per-mile pledge to really make me work for it.  ;o)  I'd be THRILLED <br/>
and eternally grateful for any pledges to help give back to the trail <br/>
systems that have given most of us so much.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't even have to be much.  One person (not sure if I should <br/>
mention names, but they can raise their hand if they want!) talked <br/>
eight of his co-workers into pledging a penny per mile which--if I <br/>
hike my expected number of miles--only amounts to less than two <br/>
dollars per person.  A hundred pledges that amount to $10 per pledge <br/>
would reach my $1,000 goal!  It doesn't take much to make a <br/>
difference!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, thanks for listening.  Like I said before, all the details <br/>
about the Hike-A-Thon can be found at <br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/hikeathon/ and you can make a pledge at any <br/>
time up until the end of this months.  Thanks again!<br/>
