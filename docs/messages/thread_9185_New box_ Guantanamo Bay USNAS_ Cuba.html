Ok, I know everyone isn't going to jump right up and try to find this one,<br/>
but how often does one get the opportunity to plant a box on Cuba?<br/>

Take Kittery Beach Road (off of Sherman, of course) to the plant nursery.<br/>
You can park your Humvee, golf cart, or other tactical vehicle in the<br/>
nursery parking lot.  Walk up the road past the nursery, and take Hutia<br/>
Highway to the right.  Keep following the path straight until you can only<br/>
go right or left.  Make the right turn.  At the red/bicycle marker, walk 13<br/>
paces along the path.  Turn 11 degrees and walk to the concrete wall.  Free<br/>
the letterbox hidden underneath the pile of rocks.<br/>

Unfortunately, I can't go looking for this one but I very highly applaud your sizeable contribution to broadening our horizons and spreading the wonder of letterboxing to new and more interesting venues.Â  Anybody able to plant one on Diego Garcia?</body></html>

   Did you get permission from the Head Cheese? Or will they shot <br/>
