                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry you couldn't find the box.  Another boxer was out there recently and <br/>
reported no problems.  If you check out the compass reading near the Viaduct, <br/>
the trail should be obvious.... its a HUGE trail (nothing small).  Also, the <br/>
bright green water marker should be quite obvious as well, and I doubt that <br/>
has gone anywhere since it is a water main.<br/>
<br/>
I won't have time to get to the box this week... perhaps on Friday before <br/>
heading out West to my brother's to stay over before the gather.<br/>
