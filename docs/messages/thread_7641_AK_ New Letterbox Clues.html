September 2002 at the shrine of St. Therese. (Unfortunately, the <br/>
county that Juneau is in is unknown.) <br/>
<br/>
Because this box is an orphan, would you be kind enough to drop me a <br/>
line at mlgainey@yahoo.com after you stamp in letting me know the <br/>
condition of the box? Much thanks.<br/>
<br/>
The shrine is, of course, a religious place, so please act <br/>
accordingly. I urge you to explore it beyond the clues below; I found <br/>
it to be a calming, restorative place.<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>
<br/>
Take Egan Drive in the direction of the ferry terminal and Auke Bay.<br/>
Keep driving toward "the end of the road."<br/>
Make a left at the sign to the shrine of St. Therese.<br/>
Take the Grotto Trail.<br/>
Take the right fork.<br/>
At the next fork, keep straight.<br/>
Cross the bridge.<br/>
Take the left fork.<br/>
Take the trail to the Merciful Love Labyrinth, the Shrine <br/>
Columbarium, and the Marian and Biblical Gardens.<br/>
Take the trail to The Gap.<br/>
Walk to the right side of The Gap.<br/>
The box is hidden in a hole in a mound across from the remains of a <br/>
twisted stump. One tall, slender tree rises up from the mound.<br/>
