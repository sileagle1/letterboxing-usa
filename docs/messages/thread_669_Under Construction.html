me of word processing 10 years ago (the dark ages in computer-years)<br/>
before it got so easy my 8 year old could do it. html is a PAIN!<br/>
Anybody remember wysiwyg? Give me a break! But it's been kind of fun<br/>

first web site to see if it works and loads fast and is visually<br/>

better?). As a bonus, there are some new clues there that haven't been<br/>
seen outside our little local community.<br/>

Nice work Jay! I like what you've done.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;html is a PAIN!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It can be, but the rewards are great when you see your finished product.<br/>

I would have loved to search for some of these boxes this July when we were<br/>
searching the other CT boxes.<br/>

Your web page looks great.  I am taking an HTML workshop next month, so <br/>
hopefully soon I will no longer need to bother Tom Cooch with setting up my <br/>
clues on the web either.  Interesting how this hobby is prompting us all to <br/>
grow in our knowledge, indoors and out.<br/>
<br/>
Nice work, and thanks!<br/>
