the "what's new" list that I'm pretty sure I know why. Deb Blanchard<br/>
is a wonderful teacher in the Raymond/Sebago Lakes area. I hesitate to<br/>
speak for her, but I'm pretty sure she's recently posted some Raymond<br/>
Town letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
They are part of the Raymond Lakes Letterboxing Trail. You may find<br/>
more information on how to begin this here:<br/>
http://www.raymondmaine.org/library_arts_history/letterboxing/default.htm<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to speak with the placer(s) of those Raymond boxes to<br/>
hopefully straighten things out so that we will be able to read the<br/>
clues. I have a good feeling the kids in her classes might be involved<br/>
in the construction of a webpage related to the trail and map also!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested please check the link and/or contact me off<br/>
list. I would be happy to put you in touch with the "right people."<br/>
