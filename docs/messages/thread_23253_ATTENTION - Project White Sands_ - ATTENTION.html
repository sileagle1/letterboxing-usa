                    <div class="plaintext-content">This past Sunday, while checking up on the condition of my White <br/>
Sands letterbox, it came to my attention that the area has become so <br/>
littered with trash. When I placed this box, the area was quite <br/>
nice, but not as nice as I wish for it to be. Since I have found the <br/>
area in such a condition, I have decided to call out to the <br/>
letterboxing community. I am planning a get together/gathering, May <br/>
7th called Project White Sands. I am asking that anyone who is <br/>
interested, to come down and help myself clean up such a beautiful <br/>
area. I will bring pizza from my work, which I'm sure my boss will <br/>
greatfully donate, as well as hefty trash bags. If anyone is <br/>
interested in joining in my efforts to keep New Hampshire clean can <br/>
email me. If enough people offer thier services, the location of <br/>
White Sands with no longer be a mystery.<br/>
<br/>
I plan on carving a special stamp for Project White Sands, for those <br/>
who come and join my efforts. There are also many boxes within 20 <br/>
miles of White Sands.<br/>
<br/>
All the help and will be greatfully appreciated.<br/>
