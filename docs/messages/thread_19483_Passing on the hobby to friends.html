But actually we've had the best luck taking someone out with us (I guess some people don't really want to read about it).  We got my nephew &amp; his fiance started that way and two friends recently asked that we give them a "private training session".  We showed them how to use a compass, they followed the clues and we showed them what to do about stamping in the box logbook &amp; a personal journal.<br/>

If you really want to pass this hobby to a friend give them the gift <br/>
of the letterboxing bug. Hold off on the emails, the books, etc and <br/>
take them out for a letterbox outing. Once they participate...THEN <br/>
give them the tools to become involved (i.e. web groups, books, et <br/>
al).  <br/>

Remember that people only remember the first impression... if their <br/>
first impression is a message group, they are likely to not be as <br/>
enthusiastic [ as compared to experiencing the LB hunt]! Also, get <br/>
them involved and then bring them to a gathering!  Afterall, half the <br/>
reason we love this sport so much is the oppurtunity to go hiking <br/>
with incredible people whom we might not have met...<br/>
<br/>
We again want to openly thank (or is it yell at?) Patrick and Amy for <br/>
getting us entirely hooked on letterboxing almost 2 years ago! <br/>

MommaFox and Bald Eagle talked to us about this<br/>

they kidnapped us to VT and made us letterbox with<br/>
them. (ONLY KIDDING ) We had to letterbox but after<br/>
the first one we were hooked. I wish we had listened<br/>
to them. But my main point here is all the talk in the<br/>
world is just talk no one listens. Show them how much<br/>
fun it is and they will understand.<br/>

My mother was taking my kids and they had all the supplies.  Finally on a trip to a wedding I decided to participate.  Instant addiction!<br/>
