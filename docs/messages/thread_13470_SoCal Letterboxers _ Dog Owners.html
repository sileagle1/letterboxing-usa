                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those that hike with your dog or dogs here is something that should be of interest. The Orange Co. Chapter of Quail Unlimited is putting on their annual snake avoidance clinic August 2 &amp; 3 . The clinic location will be in Lake Forest and will be by appointment only. This event normally sells out. The cost is $50.00 for the first dog and $40.00 for the second dog. Contact Tom Schamber at 714 841 0527. You can get some more info at www.quoc256.org/.  I have put my Britainies through this type of training and I encourage any dog owner to do the same whether they hunt with their dogs or just take them on hikes. It is very cheap prevention. Don<br/>
