My sister, Psychomommy, is busy moving boxes.:) Anyhow, I cut and <br/>
pasted her last "Pool" notice for those that are interested.<br/>

Keep on hiking Ryan! Maryland is a breeze, I hope you have your Deet, <br/>
and watch out for the afternoon thunderstorms. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
The Little Ponderosa BBQ claims to have the best BBQ: pork, beef, <br/>
chicken and turkey, in the area. On Thrusdays it is open from 8 a.m. <br/>
to 4 p.m and Friday and Sat. 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Reading the sad looking <br/>
map from the flier that I have, the BBQ place is located on Potomac <br/>
St. which is off of Shenandoah St. which is located down by the river <br/>
close to a train station and the parking lot. We enjoyed the food <br/>
when we were there in May.The ice cream place is down the street from <br/>
the BBQ. At the corner of Shenandoah St. and Potomac St., away from <br/>
town towards the river is an overlook. At this location is the AT and <br/>
a bridge/ train tressel that crosses the river. The walk over the <br/>
bridge is fun to do with kids. Once you crosss the river you are in <br/>
Maryland and the trail is the C&amp;O canal. If I remember correctly the <br/>
AT heads south for about a mile on the C&amp;O before heading up the hill <br/>
(for those who wish to do a little walk).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; P.S.  Pyschomommy may have better details (or any details such as <br/>
actual <br/>
&gt; name of establishment, address...)<br/>
<br/>
Pyschomommy is busy with her move of 200+ boxes, and may not make it <br/>
to Harpers Ferry on Thursday. She does plan to meet up with Ryan. <br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;What does everyone think?  Where should we meet?  Perhaps we could <br/>
meet at the ATC Headquarters.  <br/>
<br/>
If you park at the parking lot down by the river you will have a <br/>
steep climb up the hill to the ATC. Best bet is to drive to the <br/>
headquarters and park there. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps! Have fun exploring Harpers Ferry.<br/>

Thanks for the info and the great directions!  You gave them in a nice <br/>
detailed fashion -- just like our clues!  We'll see where people decide to <br/>
meet.  Regardless -- we'll put this place on our list!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry Psychomommy can't make it.  We forgot she was moving.  That is quite a <br/>
chore -- she'll need ice cream!  Tell her to take a break and join us!  BeMa<br/>

&gt;   Lizardsbutts family mentioned a great BBQ place and a great ice<br/>
&gt;cream place that they recommended.  Don't know exactly where it is.<br/>
&gt;Haven't tried it ourselves. But, it's food and it sounds good.  Just<br/>
&gt;a thought.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;The Little Ponderosa BBQ claims to have the best BBQ: pork, beef,<br/>
&gt;chicken and turkey, in the area. On Thrusdays it is open from 8 a.m.<br/>
&gt;to 4 p.m and Friday and Sat. 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Reading the sad looking<br/>
&gt;map from the flier that I have, the BBQ place is located on Potomac<br/>
&gt;St. which is off of Shenandoah St. which is located down by the river<br/>
&gt;close to a train station and the parking lot. We enjoyed the food<br/>
&gt;when we were there in May.The ice cream place is down the street from<br/>
&gt;the BBQ. At the corner of Shenandoah St. and Potomac St., away from<br/>
&gt;town towards the river is an overlook. At this location is the AT and<br/>
&gt;a bridge/ train tressel that crosses the river. The walk over the<br/>
&gt;bridge is fun to do with kids. Once you crosss the river you are in<br/>
&gt;Maryland and the trail is the C&amp;O canal. If I remember correctly the<br/>
&gt;AT heads south for about a mile on the C&amp;O before heading up the hill<br/>
&gt;(for those who wish to do a little walk).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; P.S.  Pyschomommy may have better details (or any details such as<br/>
&gt;actual<br/>
&gt; &gt; name of establishment, address...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Pyschomommy is busy with her move of 200+ boxes, and may not make it<br/>
&gt;to Harpers Ferry on Thursday. She does plan to meet up with Ryan.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;From: TripleV Gang <tripleveegang@y...><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;What does everyone think?  Where should we meet?  Perhaps we could<br/>
&gt;meet at the ATC Headquarters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you park at the parking lot down by the river you will have a<br/>
&gt;steep climb up the hill to the ATC. Best bet is to drive to the<br/>
&gt;headquarters and park there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope that helps! Have fun exploring Harpers Ferry.<br/>

It's only $5 per carload and they run very nice shuttle buses into (and back from) Harper's Ferry every 15 minutes. These buses drop off at a nice covered pavillion with benches that could theoretically be used for the exchanges.<br/>
  After a very recent trip there I really don't think there would be enough parking for everyone who says they want to attend and a $5 donation per family to the park service for 'hosting' this event would be a nice gesture.   Just a thought.<br/>

These buses drop off at a nice covered pavillion with benches that could theoretically be used for the exchanges.<br/>
  After a very recent trip there I really don't think there would be enough parking for everyone who says they want to attend and a $5 donation per family to the park service for 'hosting' this event would be a nice gesture.   Just a thought.<br/>

The Triple V Gang met up with Ryan again last night at the Blackburn Trail Center.  We met lots of cool hikerfolk and had a very enjoyable visit.  Since no decision has been made as to when and where to meet I couldn't give Ryan a time or place but I am set to email him as soon as we decide.  I know that parking is a premium in HF so I'm just not sure where the best place is.  My personal vote is for the AT headquarters but again parking may be an issue.  If we all park down at the river where the parking lots are we could just meet somewhere down there and walk up the hill to the icecream place for refreshments.<br/>
<br/>
So what does everyone think?  Who else is coming?  10am at the parking area by the river?<br/>

poor <br/>
&gt; Ryan walk up all those stairs after all the walking he's already doing<br/>
these <br/>
&gt; days :).  Perhaps we could meet at the ATC Headquarters.  I haven't been<br/>
to the <br/>
&gt; town of HF in a while (although my grandmother lives just outside the<br/>
town) <br/>
&gt; and I can't think of any other landmarks off the top of my head.<br/>

There's an ice cream place in town, the foundry, the dam, the train station,<br/>
<br/>
the wax museum, etc.<br/>
