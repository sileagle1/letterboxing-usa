it was lucky to have a lizard cross your path.  Since in MI we don't <br/>
have lizards, I felt deprived of the chance to run across this <br/>
unexpected bestowment of good luck...  Thus the Lucky 'Lil Lizard -- <br/>
for those who don't have the fortune to cross paths with a lizard, <br/>
and an added bonus for those who do!<br/>
<br/>
I had thought about carrying him around in my pack as a traveler <br/>
stamp, an always-present lucky companion, but alas, the little guy <br/>
slithered out of my pack in into a letterbox.  I don't think he has <br/>
any idea how cold he's going to get here in Michigan this winter!  <br/>
Hopefully somebody will be able to come to his rescue and carry him <br/>
to a new home before that!<br/>
<br/>
Now the only thing you need to figure out is how to score him -- an <br/>
F, an HH or a L?  Guess that's up to you ;-)<br/>
