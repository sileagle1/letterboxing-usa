&gt;My Midlife Crisis Letterboxing Adventure<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;By Forester<br/>
&gt;May 28, 2001<br/>
&gt;On Friday evening my immediate family came over to celebrate my<br/>
birthday.  We went to eat at the historic Sussex Inn in the middle of<br/>
the town by the same name.  It was a very good meal and I got some nice<br/>
gifts, including some money.  However, the most enjoyable part was<br/>
playing with my nephew Michael.<br/>
&gt;Some friends of mine went camping this weekend down in Cape May, New<br/>
Jersey.  I joined them 2 years ago and we had a great weekend.  The best<br/>
part was going to sunset beach and spreading out a blanket to watch the<br/>
sun go down while sharing a pot of spaghetti and meatballs.  I couldn't<br/>
make it last year or this one and I really felt bad since they got<br/>
rained on both times.  I had wanted to do some letterboxing and I set<br/>
this weekend as a time to get started.  Being that my friends were<br/>
getting soggy down in Cape May, I decided to I'd go out in the rain as a<br/>
way of being in solidarity with them.<br/>
&gt;On Saturday morning I took my birthday money and bought myself a coated<br/>
nylon rain suit and a new lensatic compass.   The compass I already have<br/>
was from my forestry days and is marked in bearings instead of azimuths.<br/>
  I decided to make the new one my official letterboxing compass and to<br/>
store it in a special letterboxing pouch that I would assemble later.<br/>
My stamp and journal were in a ziplock plastic bag.<br/>
&gt;Next I headed south on Route 23 to Mountain Side Reservation to find<br/>
Wingfoot's letterbox there.  The walk didn't take too long and I was<br/>
able to stamp in rather quickly.  When I returned to the road I<br/>
remembered that there was an artist supply store on 23.  I didn't care<br/>
much for the spiral loose-leaf I was using for a journal and wanted to<br/>
see if I could get a good hardcover bound sketchbook.  I hadn't been<br/>
able to locate one that was small enough to carry.  The first store<br/>
didn't have what I wanted and I ended up going further south down Route<br/>
23 to Staples were I found the perfect pouch for the job and a lined<br/>
journal.<br/>
&gt;Then I took a u-turn and stopped in an arts and crafts store on the<br/>
northbound side.  I was able to find sketchbook that I liked better<br/>
there.  I just happened to browse in the next isle and to my surprise I<br/>
found a rubberstamp carving kit complete with a slab of rubber, tracing<br/>
paper, a wooden handle and 2 special carving blades.  It's made by<br/>
Speedball; the same people who make pen and ink products.  I'm already<br/>
thinking about my next placement.<br/>
&gt;After that I picked up a sandwich from Blimpies and headed for another<br/>
Wingfoot box in a park called The Tourne.  There was a covered picnic<br/>
area there where I sat eating my sandwich as I arranged my pouch and<br/>
read the clues. The walk up the mountain was relatively easy and I saw 4<br/>
deer and a wild turkey on the way.  The clues called to start following<br/>
the compass directions from a bench at a viewpoint where you could see<br/>
the Twin Towers at 110 degrees.  I knew right off that I was never going<br/>
to see that far in the weather conditions that day.  However, as the<br/>
trail spiraled up the mountain, I realized that the viewpoints were each<br/>
facing in specific directions depending on where the trees were cut.<br/>
When I found a lookout that faced 110 degrees, I followed the clues and<br/>
found my reward quite readily.  In less then 45 minutes I had returned<br/>
from stamping in and headed for my next quarry.<br/>
&gt;Having picked up the two Wingfoot boxes so easily, I was lulled into a<br/>
false sense of security.  I decided to head up to the Weis Ecology<br/>
Center in Ringwood.  How hard could that be?  I pulled in at about 5pm<br/>
and went to the visitor center to get a trail map.  All the literature<br/>
was in the outside foyer and although the main building was closed an<br/>
attendant came out to ask if there was anything he could help me with.<br/>
I didn't mention anything about letterboxing, but just said I was<br/>
looking for the blue trail.  He told me to walk up Snake Den Road along<br/>
side the center and it was at the end.  As I walked up the road I met a<br/>
local woman walking a dog and asked her to verify that the trail was in<br/>
that direction.  After she explained how the trails come off the road<br/>
she asked if I was coming out the same way.  There was something about<br/>
the tone in her voice that didn't sit right with me.  I guess she was<br/>
wondering why anyone would be heading into the woods after 5pm on a<br/>
rainy day.<br/>
&gt;I guess I should have been wondering the same thing.  Maybe I was just<br/>
fooling myself.  I was on a roll and didn't want to stop.  I refused to<br/>
consider the possibility that this might be an extended hike.  The clues<br/>
said nothing about time or distance; only landmarks.  Since I wasn't<br/>
familiar with this area I had no idea of how expansive the trail system<br/>
was.  I knew it would be strenuous, but I didn't think it would be long,<br/>
time wise.  I guess I should have looked more closely at the map scale<br/>
and the trail intersections that were mentioned in the clues.<br/>
&gt;The further I hiked the more it started to occur to me that this wasn't<br/>
going to be a quick "in and out" job.  However, I still thought the<br/>
destination was much closer than it actually was.  At about 5:45pm I<br/>
decided to forge on not realizing that I wasn't even half way.  By the<br/>
time I realized it I was past the point of no return.  I finally reached<br/>
the box at 7pm and stamped in.  The ecology center map showed other<br/>
trails, but there were no contours shown to give me an idea of the<br/>
terrain.  The clues had taken me by the scenic route over mountain<br/>
peaks. I'm sure the view was excellent on sunny days.  If I could be<br/>
sure that one of the more direct trails was relatively flat I might have<br/>
chanced it and struck out for the Ecology Center.  Unfortunately, I<br/>
didn't have enough information to draw that conclusion.<br/>
&gt;I had already made one mistake that went against my better judgment by<br/>
starting in so late.  I wasn't going to make another one.  The trail map<br/>
showed that there was a parking area on a road about 1/2 a mile past the<br/>
letterbox location.  The road was on the other side of the state forest,<br/>
but I figured it was a lot safer to be on a road in the dark than in the<br/>
middle of the woods.  After going back to the stream for a quick drink<br/>
out of my hand I headed for the parking area.  Not long after that I<br/>
found the needed trail intersection and headed down the last forested<br/>
leg of my journey.<br/>
&gt;The trail was getting closer to the road and I could hear an occasional<br/>
car go by.  After walking for a while parallel to the road, but a<br/>
distance off, I looked ahead and saw a bear galloping along the trail in<br/>
my direction.  He wasn't a very big one but I'm sure his nails were<br/>
still sharper than mine.  He hadn't seen me yet and when I gave a loud<br/>
yell it startled him and he made a sudden right turn to disappear into<br/>
the woods.  At this point I decided not to wait for the trail to hit the<br/>
road and headed straight for it.<br/>
&gt;Now I was out of the woods but not exactly out of trouble.  As I<br/>
descended the last mountain I went through some thick mountain laurels,<br/>
which saturated my legs and boots.  I hadn't worn the rain suit pants<br/>
this time.  I figured I was going to get wet anyway, but I didn't expect<br/>
to be out that long.  The road route back to the Ecology Center was<br/>
probably about 10 miles.  Cars were passing at a moderate rate and I<br/>
tried unsuccessfully to thumb a ride as I walked along the road.  As<br/>
soon as I had gotten out of the woods I called the Ecology Center on my<br/>
Cell Phone and left a message on their answering machine.   I probably<br/>
wouldn't be missed for another day or 2, but if the man I talked with<br/>
saw my car he might have notified a search team.  I didn't want them<br/>
needlessly searching in the woods while I was on the road.<br/>
&gt;I was between a rock and a hard place.  I wasn't in any immediate<br/>
health danger, which would justify calling 911, but I wasn't looking<br/>
forward to walking 10 miles in the dark and rain.  Further up the road I<br/>
began to pass houses.  Most were dark since it was early in the evening<br/>
and they were probably elsewhere for the holiday.  I got to an<br/>
intersection with a closed gas station.  As I saw it in the distance I<br/>
hoped that there'd be a soda machine as I was really thirsty.  No such<br/>
luck.<br/>
&gt;I started to see some houses with lights on and activity, but I still<br/>
hoped to hitch a ride and didn't want to intrude.  There was one house<br/>
with a lot of cars and an obvious party going on.  There were people<br/>
sitting in the garage at the end of a long driveway drinking.  A little<br/>
girl saw me and came running down the driveway to greet me.  The mother<br/>
screamed at her to come back.  I figured it wasn't a good time to ask<br/>
for help and just smiled in their direction and kept walking up the<br/>
road.  I can't imagine what I must have looked like trudging along<br/>
soaking wet through the rain.<br/>
&gt;As I continued along the road I passed through a lake community.  There<br/>
was a cabin with some lights on and the faint sound of rock music.  The<br/>
personalized address sign said "Smokin' Joe's."  I decided to pass on<br/>
that one too.  It was totally dark now and the road was narrow and<br/>
dangerous, without much of a shoulder in some places.  A little further<br/>
up the road I came to a contractor's parking lot.  As I stood by the<br/>
mailbox, I got an idea.  I'd call information and try to get a local<br/>
taxi service.  I could give them the address on the mailbox.  They could<br/>
pick me up and bring me to a MAC machine in town and then to my car.<br/>
That idea went out the door when I saw that my cell phone could no<br/>
longer get reception.<br/>
&gt;I was beginning to wonder if I could get a ride easier if I collapsed<br/>
on the side of the road instead of sticking out my thumb as cars went<br/>
by.  I'm not a very good actor and was determined not to let it get to<br/>
the point where it was real.  As I continued up the road my legs started<br/>
to cramp due to their soaked condition.  I knew that I couldn't stop for<br/>
any long period of time as they would cramp so bad that I wouldn't be<br/>
able to move.<br/>
&gt;I finally decided to seek help at a house.  There was no answer at the<br/>
first one I tried.  I walk a little further up the road and came to a<br/>
small white house.  As I knocked on the door, the dogs started barking.<br/>
 A younger looking guy with a ponytail opened the door and gave me a<br/>
stare.  I tried to explain my situation to him and where I needed to go.<br/>
&gt;He seemed astounded at how far I had come.  "How'd you get here? Snake<br/>
Den Road is a long way off!"<br/>
&gt;"No kidding."<br/>
&gt;When I asked if he could just look up a taxi in the phonebook, he<br/>
looked me in the eye and said, "You ain't a crazy man, are you?"<br/>
&gt;"No, other than starting a 4 hour hike at 5pm in the rain, I'm usually<br/>
pretty sane."<br/>
&gt;"Well then, I'll take you there. I was just about to go to town to pick<br/>
up a pizza, anyway."<br/>
&gt;He went in to tell his wife (or girlfriend) where he was going and went<br/>
out the back.  I stepped away from the door and saw him revving up a<br/>
rather large 4-wheel drive bronco-type truck with a loud muffler.  He<br/>
drove around the other side of the house and pulled right up so I was<br/>
standing in the headlights.  He probably wanted a better look at me.  I<br/>
walked to the passenger side and as I got in he stared rather<br/>
uncomfortably at my new black letterboxing pouch.  It was then that I<br/>
realized that it looked just the right size to hold a handgun.  That's<br/>
probably why no one stopped for me on the road.<br/>
&gt;As we drove along we started talking and I think he realized that I was<br/>
safe.  He said his name was Elmer and he had just moved back to New<br/>
Jersey after being gone since he was 19.  We had been to some of the<br/>
same states.  I told him about letterboxing and how I ended up walking<br/>
down his road.  He said there was an old woods road behind his house<br/>
that went straight to the Ecology Center.  I said that I didn't think it<br/>
would be safe in the dark without a flashlight.<br/>
&gt;"Yeah", he responded. "Besides, Bobo's been around."<br/>
&gt;"Who's Bobo?"<br/>
&gt;"A bear"<br/>
&gt;"Oh, bears. I know about them."<br/>
&gt;When we finally got to the car and said I'd buy him a beer if I ever<br/>
saw him in a bar.  He seemed like that type.  However, it didn't occur<br/>
to me that I don't spend much time in bars myself now days; unless<br/>
they're attached to restaurants.  He told me not to worry about it and<br/>
was on his way.  I think I'll drop off something on his door next time I<br/>
go down Otterhole Road.<br/>
