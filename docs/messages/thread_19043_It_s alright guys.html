<br/>
Lord knows if the powers that be will let this post go through or <br/>
not.  But I have received so many emails about the current situation <br/>
that I figured I would try and post something.  Yes I am pretty hurt <br/>
and upset about being removed as a moderator when my only attempt <br/>
ever way to help improve the list and make it a more friendly place <br/>
to be.  But I would ask everyone to keep one thing in mind, whether <br/>
you like me or hate me; my goal was for a list free of flame wars <br/>
and personal attacks.  So let's keep it that way.  If you have <br/>
strong opinions on what happened here, email the moderators, Randy, <br/>
or me privately.  Let's not let this turn into another hateful <br/>
thread of slamming people and causing them to defend themselves.  A <br/>
decision was made based on the consensus of "old school" boxers; I <br/>
will respect that and go quietly into the night.  Hey it's like I <br/>
have been telling everyone that has written me about it. It is <br/>
historically proven that most people that try to change things for <br/>
the better end up hated, assassinated or spoken badly of during the <br/>
time that they try to change it.  Just look at Martin Luther King <br/>
Jr. But his dream came true in the end.  Maybe mine will too and <br/>
people will just start being nicer and more civil and polite around <br/>
her.  If so, then hey, nothing I did was in vain.  I can be the <br/>
martyr of letterboxing, I kind of dig that!<br/>
