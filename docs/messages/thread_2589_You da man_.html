rock where I've been lurking and break ranks with the hidden cabal: <br/>
as I'm sure most of you already suspected, we've got a secret <br/>
handshake. When we pass one another in the deep dark forest, we hold <br/>
our hands up together with our thumbs against the opposite index <br/>
finger as an enigmatic signal. Try it: it's empowering and it makes a <br/>
special shape appropriate to boxers and now everyone can do it.<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, I want to "out" myself as a supporter of Eric and what <br/>
he is trying to do for the letterboxing community. If you look at <br/>
anybody's "links" pages, you'll see a growth in people supporting the <br/>
pastime online. My personal favorites include the Mapsurfer pages, <br/>
the RuthAnn Zaroff pages, Jolly G-Man's work, RIBNAG, Kurdziel's <br/>
three-leafed pages, and the new Perfect Circle Letterboxing Guild. As <br/>
I've said before about letterboxes, they're like chocolate chip <br/>
cookies: you can never have too many. Same with the websites that tie <br/>
us together as a community. The more options and creativity and <br/>
excitement, the better.<br/>
<br/>
My hat is off to Eric and his love of letterboxing. Go for it, doc!<br/>
