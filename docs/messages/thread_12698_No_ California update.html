                    <div class="plaintext-content">Funhog's Towering Oaks is alive and well. The stamp image is one of those fairly simple but very beautifully carved stamps. It makes a great picture if repeated on the page.<br/>
     Hog Lake Plateau was almost 1/2 filled with water but the book and stamp stayed dry in their zip loks. We replaced old zip loks, dried out the box and  placed it on top of some rocks before covering the letterbox. The ground was so wet Gwen boulder hopped as in the movie "Tremors".<br/>
      Ide Homestead was our 3rd Funhog box of the day and Ryan was certainly right it is a gutsy place to put a box. What a great place to live!<br/>
       We weren't able to locate the letterbox at Redding rest stop behind Turtle Bay. We found what we believe was the right area but grass has grown very high. We tromped around a  good bit but no luck.  Has anyone else found it?<br/>
      Dvn2rckr's Queen City Shasta was an interesting find. We had to switch off using one set of clues then another as it was raining fairly hard. Gwen after boulder hopping at Hog Lake to keep dry, volunteered to remove her boots and wade through 6 inches of standing water to reach the metal box. Inside the metal box the micro letterbox was submerged in water. Surprise, inside the micro box was dry but for how long who knows. G didn't want to put it back as was<br/>
certain the box would not stay dry much longer.  But we had no better ideas at<br/>
the time of where to put it or even if we should.  We know the box is an orphan so if someone who lives close could rescue it and keep it dry  until everything dries out in Shasta area, that would be the best thing for the little box.  <br/>
      Glory Hole was safe and dry. Water was pouring into the hole and looked scary from a boater's perspective.  The folks at Visitor's Center thought us nuts<br/>
to be exploring the area in the pounding rain..<br/>
       Crystal Creek Falls was our favorite. The falls were absolutely fantastic after so many days of rain . I estimated that there was in excess of 1200 CFS coming down. The hiding spot was super.This is a must see spot.<br/>
       Dammed Shasta was a welcome drive by. We couldn't find the 4 ft. rusted pole but knew where the box should be and found it safe and dry.  Did we mention it RAINED A LOT?   We are from So. Cal and have never experienced so much rain.<br/>
<br/>
        Planted Wild Goose and Dam Raccoon before heading south. Don &amp; Gwen<br/>
