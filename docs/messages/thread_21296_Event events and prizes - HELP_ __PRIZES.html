I have been to a couple of events that give prizes for the person who <br/>
came from the furtherest distance to the gathering (I get that one a <br/>
lot when I go to East Coast gatherings :-)<br/>
<br/>
Or the Person who has the most Plants, and the Person who has the <br/>
most Finds. (Log books must be present to confirm these claims)<br/>
<br/>
The Person who found the most letterboxes on the day of the gathering!<br/>
<br/>
The Person who has the most exchanges in their logbook (or the person <br/>
who has been to the most gatherings)<br/>
<br/>
Prizes can be as simple or complex as you choose them to be. I have <br/>
seen Certificates made for the Most Plants, Most Finds. I have seen <br/>
Ink Pads or Rubbermaid containers given away as prizes. Especially, <br/>
fancy ink pads like Dabbers or ink pen sets. <br/>
<br/>
Carving Kits are another good prize, especially if you give a prize <br/>
to the most Newbie letterboxer to attend your gathering! We were at a <br/>
gathering once when a person showed up who had never been <br/>
letterboxing (no plants and no finds until that day), and they showed <br/>
up to see what the deal was...<br/>
