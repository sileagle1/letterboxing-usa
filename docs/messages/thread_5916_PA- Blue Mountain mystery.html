<br/>
Anyone found these boxes lately (or not so lately)?  Just came off <br/>
Blue Mountain but without the stamps.  Thought I had it figured out <br/>
by reading the contours on the map but when I got there certainly <br/>
realized that I had little clue where the first box was, but when <br/>
looking where I thought the second box 'had' to be I came up empty <br/>
handed there, too.  (ya know that syndrome- "I'm SURE I was in the <br/>
right place!" lol)<br/>
<br/>
Is it better to try this one when the leaves have left the trees?  <br/>
Would that make my job a little easier?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway- great hiking up there.  Poor Buddy the Beagle still hasn't <br/>
moved since we returned.  I think he'll be sleeping a looong time <br/>
after this latest adventure.  Poor old doggie!  Send good biscuit <br/>
thoughts his way. ;o)<br/>
