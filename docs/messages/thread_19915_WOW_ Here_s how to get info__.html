Birthday series...since I was going off an archived list, they might<br/>
have been updated and we didn't see.  We couldn't find any of the<br/>
three, so I'm thinking that may be the case.  It was a nice walk<br/>
though, and someplace that we otherwise may have never discovered!!<br/>
<br/>
My DH got into the action, which was so exciting.  <br/>

&gt;    Finally some new info on this site. That's the upside. The <br/>
&gt; downside is I have/had my boxes in Centennial and you may have been <br/>
&gt; looking for boxes that are no longer available. Hope you were <br/>
&gt; successful.<br/>

&gt; &gt; when it's down.  I guess I should have whined to my DH sooner ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just go to google and type in "Way Back machine"  Find the internet<br/>
&gt; &gt; archive website and type in www.letterboxing.org.  VOILA, there ya' <br/>
&gt; go :)<br/>
