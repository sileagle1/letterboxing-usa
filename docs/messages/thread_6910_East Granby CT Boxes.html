<br/>
<br/>In between sending our first three letterboxes into the world (clues to follow later tonight!), we managed to get in some searching, too.
<br/>
<br/>We went back to East Granby, CT for four boxes that we didn't get the first time. First, we went to visit Fun in Spoonville, down by the Farmington River. We found both boxes in good condition, though the logbooks are getting rather full. We also met some folks kayaking down the river, as well as a nice sunbather. Yet another place that we never would have known existed. Isn't this hobby great? :-)
<br/>
<br/>We then went back to Old Newgate Prison for the Barrel of Monkeys and the Holy Cow boxes. Again, no problems finding the boxes, and both were in great shape. Unfortunately, the weather wasn't as good this week, so the views were a little hazy, but still worth the trip.
