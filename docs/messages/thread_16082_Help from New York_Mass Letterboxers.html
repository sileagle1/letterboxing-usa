                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK- I need a bit of help here from all you kind eastern New York and<br/>
western MA boxers out there. I recently got my parents interested in<br/>
the letterboxing hobby. They came out to a few boxes here in Maine<br/>
with me and enjoyed it. Before going to NC for a few days they looked<br/>
up some clues online. They did not find 2 of the 3 they went searching<br/>
for and have not gotten a response from the placer so are a bit<br/>
disappointed. They also are disheartened that there are no boxes close<br/>
to them. They live in East Greenbush, NY which is in Rensselaer County<br/>
not too far from Albany and they would like to start out with some<br/>
boxes not too far from them. Not far for them means like a 45 minute<br/>
drive tops (they're not to the addicted stage yet where they'll drive<br/>
hours at a time). Of course there aren't any yet! They're considering<br/>
going to visit some of the western MA boxes that are just under an<br/>
hour away (like the ones in Stockholm) but I'm sure they would be much<br/>
more likely to go if there were some nearby. So whaddya say? Any<br/>
letterboxers out there that might be up for planting some in<br/>
Rensselaer County, New York? I don't know the area REAL well, but can<br/>
think of a few places. Contact me if you want more info. I would plant<br/>
them myself, but probably won't be down that way for a while (it's<br/>
about a 4/12 hour drive for us) and even if I did I think the thrill<br/>
would probably not be as great as discovering someone else's boxes.<br/>
Besides- that way, when I get around to visiting them maybe I can go<br/>
look for them too! Thanks for letting me ramble!<br/>

I don't think there are many in the E Greenbush / Albany vicinity yet,<br/>
but there are a few (including my first in Greenport - about 45min<br/>
south of your folks).  Check the LBNA site - for Albany and Columbia<br/>
County.  I'm hoping to hide a few more in the next few weeks in<br/>
Columbia Co. and then start in Rennselear Co.  Also, most of the boxes<br/>
in Berkshire Co. Mass would be just an hour or a little more from your<br/>
folks.<br/>

The one on the Taconic? I placed the one on the Taconic.  It is there <br/>
but it is a different stamp from which I had originally placed.  I <br/>
hope you take time to stamp in here!! Thanks! <br/>
