                    <html><body>Personally, I haven't done a lot of boxing lately, since the 20+ inches of snow we received on Presidents Day.  Of course, just when I thought I was going to be able to go out boxing this weekend... what does it do today????   SNOW!  We've got 4 inches already here in Manchester, and its still coming down hard.  So much for boxing...... (sigh)  I guess I'm going to have to carve some really small micro boxes for public libraries (like the ones in MD) to keep myself from going insane!
<br/>
<br/>BTW.... I had a BLAST last night at the carving class at the Stamp Studio in Manchester!  It was so nice to finally meet Josef, and also meet Christi from Wethersfield, AJ from Windsor, CodyBCleo, ST Bear, Dr. Brad, and a VERY new letterboxer, our carving class instructor Vesta Ann!  For those who would like to take a carving class, call Melinda at the Stamp Studio and let her know you are interested.  That way, they will try to coordinate with everyone's schedules.   Stamp Studio's phone number is: (860) 432-1087.
<br/>
<br/>Then let me know when the class is.... since I live up the street, I can stop by and exchange! :-)
