Glad someone found Bushkill..wish we had. Oh well, I'll look again when I go <br/>
up to check "Bridesmaid's" in spring of 2002.<br/>
Yes, we did find the "other" letterbox at the other northern falls location. <br/>
Our little group was the first to stamp in this April, we loved the falls <br/>
and the stamp. Nice that "Dingman's" is open year round.There were no crowds <br/>
then and we had the place almost to ourselves, traffic coming south and home <br/>
was better too, all the Pocono tourists were still at home! LOL :)<br/>
'Box On!<br/>
