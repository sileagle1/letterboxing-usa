I copy the method used by one of the smart people in the great state of<br/>
Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
Black plastic VHS tape box. Stamp in a one freezer zip lock, logbook, info<br/>
sheets and pen/pencil in another. These two are placed in a large freezer<br/>
zip lock which is placed in the black plastic VHS box. Hiding the box with<br/>
the flap/lid part down seems to work very well and they can be found very<br/>
cheap. I always carry some ziplocks in my pack to replace any I find<br/>
damaged.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the black box is true to it's name. I disappears in the undergrowth or<br/>
down holes. You can't see them. Black lends in with most all hiding spots<br/>
better than any Tupperware container.<br/>

&gt; I would definately stay away from the Ziplock and Gladlock disposable<br/>
&gt; containers in the North East.  Dropped one out of my freezer, and the<br/>
whole<br/>
&gt; container shattered into sharp shards of plastic.  Doesn't bode well for<br/>
&gt; icey temps if jolted.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone else seen the new Rubbermaid "throwaway" boxes on the<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; bought a pack of the sandwich size the other day and are planning<br/>
&gt; &gt; our first<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; box placement very soon.  They seem more durable than the Glad<br/>
&gt; &gt; brand and they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; also seem to have a nice tight seal.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don't know about the Rubbermaid boxes you mentioned.  I would<br/>
&gt; &gt; definitely caution anyone from using the ziploc or gladloc plastic<br/>
&gt; &gt; disposable brand boxes.  They don't winter well in New England.  You<br/>
&gt; &gt; may want to take into consideration how your local weather is and<br/>
&gt; &gt; what will be covering the box in the location you plan on placing it<br/>
&gt; &gt; (rocks are heavy!).  You could try using the Rubbermaid box in just<br/>
&gt; &gt; one spot and keep an eye on it to see how it weathers before you<br/>
&gt; &gt; commit to using it for all your boxes.  As mentioned before one of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the keys to the success of the boxes in bad weather are good, freezer-<br/>
&gt; &gt; style ziploc bags.<br/>
