the Cape Caper. Although it rained on and off throughout the <br/>
day, we had a lot of fun, trading boxing stories and looking<br/>
for boxes in Nickerson State Park. It looks like Southern <br/>
Massachusetts may give Connecticut a run for it's money as<br/>
far as getting enthusiastic boxers planting new boxes. I've seen <br/>
a new box being placed within 1 hour of our home every day for the<br/>
past two weeks. Way to go WaterWizards. We're having a ball finding<br/>
the boxes you've put out in Bridgewater. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Ahhhh, Connecticut. We've made many friends who live in CT through<br/>
letterboxing and would love to go to a gathering of any type. <br/>
We need to get to Hartman sometime soon and would probably want to<br/>
stay overnite in the area. We'll post to the group when we plan this <br/>
trip, I think we're looking at the weekend of Oct 18/19th and if <br/>
anyone is interested in getting together for a day of boxing and maybe<br/>
going for dinner afterward can contact us.<br/>
<br/>
Let's not let the cold and the winter keep us inside. You know you <br/>
sleep better after a great day of boxing!<br/>

While I'm replying to this message, let me take a moment to thank all<br/>
those who helped out in "planting" boxes -- Tweety and Mr. Coon,<br/>
Curious Crane and Latte Man (and friends) -- and all those who helped<br/>
out at the event with assistance in setting up, taking down, etc.  We<br/>
couldn't have done it without all your help.  Thanks again!<br/>
