The broad, er I mean lady, has a point there. Mark<br/>
Pepe - a name worth considering. By they way, Stealthy<br/>
I noticed the broad retained this investigator, not<br/>
you!<br/>
<br/>
Just what do you have to say for yourself, Mr. Pepe?<br/>
Did Der Mad Stamper lay a bum rap on you, or were you<br/>
guilty as charged? If you would stoop so low as to<br/>
steal another man's PZKut, would you go on to bigger<br/>
and better things? Is the Store of Good Manners now<br/>
hidden in rural Vermont?<br/>
<br/>
Word on the street has it that youve headed in the<br/>
wrong direction more than once. Are you now headed<br/>
down the road of crime?  <br/>
<br/>
Just where are your ethics? Are you a letterboxer, or<br/>
are those green bands nothing more than decorations?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
<br/>
Investigator Francis Bacon<br/>

<br/>
It seems you have sizzled too long on the investigating fire!<br/>
<br/>
Sure, I was guilty of the PZ Kut Caper but DMS was flaunting that <br/>
beautiful white carving media  how could I have resisted  DMS <br/>
bought all of the existing inventory and I had stamps to carve! Now, <br/>
gladly, that crime is part of my past.<br/>
<br/>
The past year, in an effort to improve myself, I have spent up to 3 <br/>
hours per day coaching, helping the newbies on our Newboxers Talk <br/>
List. We have nurtured and instructed the newbies in a variety of <br/>
methods to become better letterboxers. We've taught them our history <br/>
so they will know from where we've come. Doesn't this account for <br/>
something? <br/>
<br/>
One of our greatest accomplishments was to run a patch contest, <br/>
purchased and sold some Newboxers patches which have helped their <br/>
identity as newbies and has furthered their efforts to feel part of <br/>
the greater letterboxing community. While sales were brisk; we still <br/>
have 19 left. Maybe you would like to purchase one?<br/>
<br/>
All of the proceeds were turned over to a special fund whose purpose <br/>
is to build a letterboxing museum in CT  the undisputed center of <br/>
the letterboxing universe. Architects are now drawing up plans as I <br/>
write. Archimedes Screw will be the curator. We have turned over the <br/>
proceeds of the profits to her for safekeeping.<br/>
<br/>
So, dear Inspector, our year has been one of self improvement; <br/>
helping those new to the game and all profits have been submitted. If <br/>
you don't believe me; ask Archimedes Screw.<br/>
<br/>
OK  Screw  tell him how good I've been this past year and dispel <br/>
any suspicions that he might have against me! Finally  I wish my <br/>
name to be cleared and my rehabilitation recognized.<br/>
<br/>
Your ever improving servant.<br/>
