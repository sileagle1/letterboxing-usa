                    <div class="plaintext-content">  Friends of ours lost, quite literally, their unleashed dog while <br/>
hiking in the Berkshires. Can you imagine the sense of guilt and <br/>
grief this engendered?  He probably got caught up in running down a <br/>
deer but we will never know.<br/>
  My daughter has a pitbull and a pitbull mix. which she aquired when <br/>
they were only a few months old, from responsible specialized <br/>
shelters after lengthy interviews. Despite extensive training and <br/>
lots of love and attention, one is dog agressive if a dog runs up to <br/>
her off-leash, and one is afraid of small children.  Obviously, these <br/>
dogs are always on leash even in my yard when they visit. When she  <br/>
hikes with these dogs it is dumbfounding how many owners have dogs <br/>
off-leash who run up to her dogs, as she restrains and commands the <br/>
agresser to behave. She gets lectures from these people who are  not <br/>
following park policy about the dog breed, to add insult to injury. I <br/>
am very much anti-breeding. However, these dogs are here and deserve <br/>
a good shot at life.  <br/>
  One point I wish to make is that leashing protects one's beloved <br/>
pet as well as the hapless hikers who must endure unwanted attention <br/>
positive and negative) from unleashed dogs in public parks. I am <br/>
certainly one who encounters unleashed dogs all too often.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have been reading these posts and want to put in an earnest pitch for <br/>
leashing your dog while hiking.  It is thoughtless at best and dangerous at worst, <br/>
to your pet and to others, to permit a dog to wander unleashed in a public <br/>
park.<br/>
<br/>
I take my children letterboxing and hiking at least once a week.  I have a 7 <br/>
year old, a 4 year old and a 2 year old.  We have several times had large dogs <br/>
come running down the trail followed by their thoughtless owners (who are <br/>
sometimes trying to stop the dog and sometimes not!) and scare my children into <br/>
running shrieking and shaking behind me. The worst was an aggressive red chow  <br/>
that ran barking at my younger son and whose owner had the gall to be angry <br/>
because I popped the dog in the head with my walking stick when it wouldn't back <br/>
off.  I also sometimes hike with a friend who is allergic to animal dander <br/>
and she can't abide being jumped on by other's pets, and this has happened and <br/>
basically ruined her hike.<br/>
<br/>
I love dogs and try to teach my children not to be afraid of them but this <br/>
certainly doesn't help.  I can't wait for the day when we can have a dog to take <br/>
hiking with us!  But, it just about stops my heart when I can't read the <br/>
dog's intentions as it's running toward my small child.  I use the knee in the <br/>
chest when the dog jumps on me but if a dog jumps on one of my children, I'm <br/>
going to hurt it and give no apology if it is injured or even killed.  <br/>
