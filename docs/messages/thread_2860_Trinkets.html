I would think that anything you want to put in there that is not <br/>
dangerous or likely to attract animal interest (e.g. NO food, <br/>
perfume, etc..) would be fine. I am not sure how prevalent the <br/>
trinkets are. That is a main part of geocaching, but very secondary <br/>
to letterboxing. I have not personally put any trinkets into my boxes <br/>
unless they are combo geocaching boxes. However, I have found that <br/>
many people have left things in my boxes when they visited them and I <br/>
have been pleasantly surprised when I check them.<br/>

Best "trinket" I have found so far was the troll guarding Mitch Klink's<br/>
troll letterbox.  His location was appropriate and he had a good home.  We<br/>
hope to visit him again.<br/>

cameras for the finder to take a snapshot<br/>
of him/herself and leave in the box. Some<br/>
other items you might consider are playing<br/>
cards, money (gold dollar coins would be<br/>
fun), toys (like you get with happy meals),<br/>
compasses, pocketknives, disposable<br/>
handwarmers, keychains, gift certificates,<br/>
handmade art/craft items, seashells,<br/>
pretty rocks, postcards, etc. If your<br/>
box has a "theme", it might be fun to<br/>
add a trinket that ties in with the theme.<br/>
Don't leave food or scented items for<br/>
obvious reasons. Leave a note about<br/>
your trinket cache for those who are not<br/>
familiar with the concept.<br/>

There is cold, hard cash in one of the letterboxes I<br/>
have placed :-)<br/>
<br/>
Also, in a Minnesota letterbox, I found a gift certificate<br/>
to a restaurant in Indiana (which I left for the next person<br/>
to enjoy).<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, these ideas also predate geocaching :-)  Does that <br/>
mean anything?  I don't think so.  I guess I feel that,<br/>
and perhaps I am in the minority, that despite the fact <br/>
that a few boxes have used geo coordinates as part of their<br/>
clues, and some others have contained trinkets, that the <br/>
geocachers (Dave Ulmer in particular) have invented geocaching, <br/>
and any attempt to claim (partially) otherwise here, in not my <br/>
words,  may actually be a bit on the "petty" side (and I've <br/>
been a spectator of geocaching since it was invented, and been <br/>
a spectator of letterboxing since about a month after the <br/>
Smithsonian Article).  Just my opinion anyway, does it really<br/>
matter? -- what happened happened.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the idea of using geo coordinates to describe the<br/>
location of something for people to find is older than dirt <br/>
anyway, as is the idea of leaving trinkets for people to find.<br/>
<br/>
In other news, I'll chime into the chorus that geo coordinates<br/>
are legitimate letterbox clues.  Anything is a legitimate letterbox<br/>
clue, as the prospective hunter can ignore boxes with clues they<br/>
dislike.<br/>
<br/>

I haven't found many boxes, however two of them I was the first <br/>
finder.  In one of those the box the planter left a $2 bill which has <br/>
a picture of the signing of the Declaration of Independence on the <br/>
back.  It was appropriate because the box was planted on the 4th of <br/>
July.  That was the Ken Lockwood gorge box.<br/>

When a year passed and no one found our box Deepest NJ #1 we thought about
adding a little something to it to spark more interest, but before we could
act it was found.  As of last weekend there has been only one set
of visitors but it's not really fair to sweeten the pot now.  In the
future I think that we might "enhance" our difficult boxes to increase
interest in them.

are a nice idea!  I've left trinkets in some of my boxes. For example, <br/>
I put little plastic pigs in the "This Little Pig" box in Amherst, <br/>
Mass. (to make it fun for kids--the box/clue are designed for young <br/>
children).  One day recently a letterboxer emailed me to say she and <br/>
her kids had found the box and were delighted by the pigs.  She said <br/>
lots of people had already been there and the supply of pigs was <br/>
running low, so she purchased more pigs and added them to the box!  <br/>

It's nice to see that a box can develop a life of its own. <br/>
