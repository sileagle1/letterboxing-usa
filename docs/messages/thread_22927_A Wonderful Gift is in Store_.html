<br/>
I have received a wonderful holiday gift that I would like to share<br/>
with you very soon. Many of you know that we have a website. I ask<br/>
that you stay tuned to it in the next few days.<br/>
<br/>
Without exaggeration - this gift is truly amazing and you will readily<br/>
agree. Please - don't miss this one! It will knock the letterboxing<br/>
world on it's ear. <br/>
<br/>
Believe me! And the crosspost will be worth it!<br/>

I know that I don't know very much about this hobby yet, but you sound like someone who has either:<br/>
<br/>
a)  won a multi-million dollar lottery<br/>
<br/>
-OR-<br/>
<br/>
b)  received a personal phone call from Condaleeza Rice announcing a multi-billion dollar government grant for the advancement of letterboxing<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I'm glad you have something great up your sleeve!<br/>
