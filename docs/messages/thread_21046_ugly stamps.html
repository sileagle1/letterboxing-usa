I hooked a 'blog friend of mine on letterboxing when I went to visit<br/>
her in Chicago.  After the second box, she made me stop at a dollar<br/>
store where she bought a cheap set of exactos and a big rubber eraser.<br/>
 She had a finished stamp with her name spelled out in relief before<br/>
we arrived at the third location and while playing native<br/>
guide/navigator to boot!!!<br/>

Hey Armadillo Jo,<br/>
I find it hard to believe you ever carved an ugly stamp!! One of my <br/>
favorite finds is an ugly little stamp carved by an 8-yr old...but <br/>
it's really quite awesome because he put it out there for others to <br/>
find and enjoy. Yes, I'm also a stamp snob and prefer pitiful <br/>
attempts at hand-carving, any day over a store-bought stamp. But <br/>
I've also learned that I prefer the store-bought ones to nothing at <br/>
all!<br/>
