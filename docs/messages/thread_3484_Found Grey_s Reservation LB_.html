update!), and saw a new letterbox in Sudbury.  Looked outside, a <br/>
beautiful warm sunny fall day and decided to go for it.  Took the <br/>
longest car ride possible so as to enjoy all the foliage in the <br/>
area.  Clues were very good, but the LB was *too* easy to find - the <br/>
last LBer left it quite exposed.  Be assured that it is now safely <br/>
tucked away in its proper hiding spot but nestled in a bed of pine <br/>
needles which protects it from uneducated prying eyes.  What a cool <br/>
spot!  Very romantic.  Looks like there was a party there recently, <br/>
so I took the liberty of removing the beer cans and throwing them <br/>
away.  Thanks for this great LB!<br/>

area as a possible next LB placement ....)<br/>
