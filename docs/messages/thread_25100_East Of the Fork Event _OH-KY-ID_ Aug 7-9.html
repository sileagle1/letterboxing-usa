Three count them three days of only letterboxing...... <br/>
This is put together as a Tri-State Event (Ohio, Kentucky <br/>
and Indiana) East Fork State Park is an easy drive and find. <br/>
It's located off of Ohio SR 125 between Amelia and Bethel <br/>
Ohio. The park has many many MANY places to hide letterboxes. <br/>
<br/>
With over 73 miles of hiking trails as well as a good size bike mountain <br/>
bike trail, we can hide so many stamps that your hands will hurt from <br/>
stamping as much as your feet will from all the hiking :O) Between now <br/>
and July 20th we will update this event to what's going on. What we do <br/>
at this event will ONLY be limited to those who would like to help out. <br/>
<br/>
If you have an idea or would like to help out at the welcome center of <br/>
the event, maybe be able to put on a class, Please e-mail me <br/>
<br/>
Teamjedi@fuse.net <br/>
<br/>
we can not have enough people to help out. We would love to see event <br/>
stamps as well. This would also be a great place to start out or many move <br/>
your hitch hikers. We had a problem with the camp site. The team that was <br/>
going to do it had to pull out. I will see what i can do by the 20th of July. <br/>
During the 3 day event, will have all kinds of door prizes you could win or <br/>
find! AGAIN, Any questions or idea's please let me know Teamjedi@fuse.net <br/>
<br/>
