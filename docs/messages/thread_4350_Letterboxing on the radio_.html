I've been asked to be a guest on a N.J. radio station for the purpose of <br/>
speaking about Letterboxing and to share some of my adventures while <br/>
'boxing.<br/>
Wanted to know how the group felt about this. Is there anything that general <br/>
public needs to be made aware of?<br/>
Would appreciate any input you care to share. I have about a month to get <br/>
prepared.<br/>
Thanks bunches!<br/>

environmentally conscious about where we are putting<br/>
our boxes so as to not destroy any habitat or defame<br/>
or deface any kind of property whether it be a stone<br/>
wall or it be a hole left by a rock pulled out of the<br/>
ground. As letterboxers we need to try to adhere to<br/>
the Leave No Trace ethic as much as possible like<br/>
everyone else enjoying the outdoors. But to sum it all<br/>
up, be responsible for what boxes you place, check on<br/>
them so they are not strewn all over the site and also<br/>
check on how people that are actually finding the<br/>
boxes are impacting the immediate area. Many paths<br/>
have been beatedn to Elaine and Jerry's Bluff.<br/>
