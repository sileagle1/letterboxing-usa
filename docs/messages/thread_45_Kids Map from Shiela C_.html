                    <div class="plaintext-content">I got Shiela's kid's map in the mail today (of the Bob Woodruff Park<br/>
Letterbox).  I have to scan it.  You're all going to like it.  I think its<br/>
definitley kid friendly.  Its 8 1/2 by 11" (in portrait) though so it may take a<br/>
large file and the page may need to be scrolled.  I'll  put it out there for you<br/>
and you can let me know how it looks.  How am I going to link this one?  Older<br/>
kids know what state they are in and can probably go through the regular maps,<br/>
but younger kids will need mom or dad I assume to help them.  Has anyone else<br/>
thought this through...<br/>
about how to set up the links for kids?  Should there be a Kid's looking state<br/>
map of texas with the Pooh type of format.  Or should there be a "Kids Map" link<br/>
option at the regular clues page?  Or some other way?<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

Ps.  Cool map Shiela!<br/>
