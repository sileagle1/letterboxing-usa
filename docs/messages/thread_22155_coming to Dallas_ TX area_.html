25th through July 3rd.  I will be in either Dallas or in Sulphur <br/>
Springs all week.  I am starting the process of seeing what is out <br/>
there, but if anyone has thoughts they would like to share on <br/>
letterboxes or exchanges in that area, I would love to know.<br/>
<br/>
I will be trying to get on to the list, but it may be easier to reach <br/>
me through my direct email over the next few days.  I would love to <br/>
know the status of any boxes or if there are ones I just can't miss :)<br/>
<br/>
Until then,<br/>
Cadenza<br/>
