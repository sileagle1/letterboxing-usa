Essex County NJ, starting from Millburn<br/>
15 minutes on rocky incline and 20 minutes on paved path<br/>
(see middle of clue for lazy driving hint)<br/>
<br/>
On Glen Avenue in Millburn<br/>
across from near where the bibliophiles gather<br/>
there is an opening in the woods<br/>
marked by a sign that says "Locust Grove".<br/>
Drive in here and park.<br/>
<br/>
Bear right, on foot now, onto the Lenape Trail,<br/>
through the picnic area, past the roof on legs,<br/>
and up the hill.  Just follow,<br/>
the trail's trees are marked in yellow.<br/>
<br/>
When you get to a metal fence, bear right<br/>
(you're still on the yellow trail)<br/>
until you come to a paved road.<br/>
Take a right here and as you walk, enjoy the fresh air.<br/>
<br/>
You will be walking for about twenty minutes,<br/>
through the white gates past which cars are allowed,<br/>
also past a semi-grassy parking area.<br/>
<br/>
You will know you're close when the road widens,<br/>
and you see an amazing overlook on the right.<br/>
(The physically unfit, if good map-readers,<br/>
can park here and avoid the hill).<br/>
<br/>
Look at Manhattan, then stand reading the<br/>
memorial rock bearing George Bramhall's name.<br/>
