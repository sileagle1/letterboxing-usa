Difficulty: Easy<br/>
pets: with leash on trail<br/>
<br/>
To the big city,<br/>
Where it's nice and windy<br/>
Park in the lot,<br/>
And hope there's a spot!<br/>
Take the main trail<br/>
Where the man holds his dog by a tail<br/>
Go over the hump and to the left<br/>
To the bench, but don't rest yet<br/>
Head down to the ocean and to the square,<br/>
Off to your right the Golden Gate is there!<br/>
Enjoy for a moment the crashing wave<br/>
And look behind you at the tree cave.<br/>
Look for the sideways tree where,<br/>
Underneath it you'll find me there!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, let me know if you have any troubles.<br/>

<br/>
Funny thing is that I was in SF yesterday thinking that I should put together a "Playland" letterbox out at Ocean Beach (it's a defunct amusement park that was once out there) with Laughing Sal as the stamp - she was the creepy animatronic clown that welcomed you to the Fun House.  But you beat me to it!<br/>
