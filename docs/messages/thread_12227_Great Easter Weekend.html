Back in RI again after a lovely little Easter trip down to the <br/>
mid-Atlantic! This time we didn't go for the "dozen-box days" that <br/>
we've done on other trips through states like VA, MD, PA, NJ, WA, <br/>
OR, etc.(just to let folks know that the potential for "big 'boxing <br/>
days" - for those few of us who really like doing them/not <br/>
recommended for others! :-) - is certainly not just limited to CT or <br/>
southern New England!) This time we decided to concentrate <br/>
mostly on mapsurfer boxes and enjoying the beautiful flowers <br/>
blooming serendipitously along the way!  We're still amazed that<br/>
we managed to find some of those boxes and that our total <br/>
mapsurfer count(31) has doubled from what is was just last <br/>
month at the PA Mystery Dinner Gathering! What a couple of fine <br/>
and challenging weekends we've had recently, and what a truly <br/>
wonderful Easter to remember! Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
