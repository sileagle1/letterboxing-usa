I love 'boxing! My son and I got hooked on it last October, "00", when a <br/>
very good friend and her husband took us on our first 'boxing jaunt to Mt. <br/>
Tammany at the Delaware Water Gap in New Jersey. Let me tell you, if you <br/>
have not been there yet, the views are outstanding and the hike up was a <br/>
real "thigh quaker" for me!!<br/>
Well worth the effort it took, we found the box, but being true newbies we <br/>
had to sign in and draw a little picture because we did not have a stamp nor <br/>
inkpad...Since then we've stamped into 39 boxes, exchanged 35 stamps, <br/>
planted 3 boxes in our local area, and loved every minute of it,( well, <br/>
almost every minute..)!!<br/>
We've been to places we never would have traveled to and met folks who have <br/>
become friends.It has been a priceless experience!!<br/>
I thank all who made it possible, box planters, clue writers, Webmasters,and <br/>
fellow boxers who made it sound so much fun on this site, and still do!!<br/>
One of the lessons I am trying to teach my 10yr old is "tolerance". He is <br/>
having a hard time of it.He does not understand why other kids just do not <br/>
get it, the "it" being his point of view.<br/>
I'm still working on, "to get along you need to agree to disagree". He still <br/>
doesn't get it, and it angers him at times, but I have hope that someday he <br/>
will he will understand...<br/>
Again, thanks to all for the fun and adventure!!See you on the trail!!<br/>
<br/>
See Joy and Lockmaster<br/>
(Joie and Austin)<br/>
<br/>
PS. "Wanda" from RI, saw your stamp at Mt. Minsi 2 weekends ago! 20,000 solo <br/>
miles on trail? Amazing!!! You "GO" Girl!!!!!!<br/>
