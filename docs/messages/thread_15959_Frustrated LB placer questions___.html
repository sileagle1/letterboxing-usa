                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi fellow letterbox-placers/finders around the country!<br/>
<br/>
I'm starting to grow rather frustrated by a hobby that I had been <br/>
really enjoying up til now.  This frustration has been stewing for <br/>
several months but I just haven't figured out how to adequately <br/>
address it without causing an uproar.  <br/>
<br/>
Bottom Line: Is anybody else out there in a similar situation?  If <br/>
so, what are your ideas/recommendations for improving it? Any <br/>
comments are greatly appreciated--either directly to me or to the <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
Problem Background:  Over the past several months, I've gone out to <br/>
check up on several letterboxes that we'd placed during our <br/>
letterboxing adventure or to seek letterboxes that other folks had <br/>
placed.  Upon finding the letterbox (if it still happened to be <br/>
there) we noticed that many were 'carelessly rehidden' if they were <br/>
even hidden at all.  <br/>
<br/>
When we place letterboxes initially, we attempt to look at the <br/>
hiding spot from an animals'/vandals'/poor weather <br/>
conditions'/groundskeepers'/gardeners'/other treasure hunters' <br/>
perspective before we actually place it.  If it looks like the box <br/>
will even remotely go missing due to any of these conditions then we <br/>
usually decide to plant it elsewhere.  Granted you can never predict <br/>
these occurrences--but trying to prepare for these in advance seems <br/>
to add a little bit of longevity to the lifespan of an average <br/>
letterbox.  We've even gone so far as to revamp many of our earlier <br/>
placed letterboxes by putting them in more camouflaged/watertight <br/>
containers. Unfortunately, several of these letterboxes have gone <br/>
missing despite these added protective measures.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how to address this subject anymore than we've already <br/>
attempted.  We include a blurb in the clues about requesting <br/>
letterboxers to look discreetly &amp; carefully for the letterbox and to <br/>
ensure that it is rehidden out of view of passersby when they are <br/>
through. Most of our letterboxes are camouflaged (minus the few <br/>
initial ones we placed we haven't yet improved upon over time) but <br/>
more &amp; more even the camouflaged ones are walking away these days.  <br/>
I'm not sure if folks tend to be more 'protective' of other peoples' <br/>
letterboxes once they've started placing them themselves or what the <br/>
issue is.  I know that I personally really started to get <br/>
that 'mother hen' feeling when I started finding letterboxes AFTER I <br/>
had placed some of my own.  Sometimes, I'll come across a letterbox <br/>
and really have a sinking feeling about its hiding spot because it <br/>
might seem really vulnerable.  I try to leave it as well hidden as <br/>
possible, but knowing that it might not survive regardless of how <br/>
well hidden it is--it's hard to part with it.  If that's the case, I <br/>
try to contact the placer to let them know it may not last long in <br/>
the same hiding spot.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that animals and outdoor conditions <br/>
often 'dislodge/nudge' letterboxes from their hiding spots but often <br/>
the letterboxes we've come across that were 'haphazardly rehidden' <br/>
had had letterboxers visit them either the same day or just a short <br/>
time before we visited them so the possibility of outside influences <br/>
dislodging them has been rather small. Yes, I've lost several <br/>
letterboxes to gardeners, squirrels, rains, vandals, schoolkids who <br/>
tore a nurse stump to SHREDS, homeless folks who like to pull bark <br/>
off of trees, other treasure hunters, etc--yes, many were just poor <br/>
placements. Others, however, are missing because they weren't <br/>
rehidden carefully.  This is what is sooo frustrating!<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how to take measures to attempt to resolve this <br/>
problem. Is there anyway to address this in the letterboxing FAQ <br/>
since I know that a LOT of new letterboxers don't even know this <br/>
message board exists but they often read the FAQ before they set out <br/>
to find their first letterbox.  Include, for example:  a blurb <br/>
like 'please don't waste other peoples' precious (not meant to be <br/>
boastful just meant in the sense that we're all on this Earth for a <br/>
short time to begin with) time/resources/artistic efforts (weak <br/>
attempts in my case) by carelessly rehiding letterboxes' (something <br/>
to that effect)or a quip about 'the letterboxing gods will rain <br/>
havoc upon careless rehiders'--something like that?  ;) Especially <br/>
finders who don't bother to ensure the little plastic baggies in <br/>
which the logbooks are contained are properly sealed.  This is a <br/>
must for moisture prone areas--even if it doesn't rain the logbooks <br/>
seem to act like sponges wicking water out of thin air. Possibly <br/>
discuss better hiding techniques (like camouflaging the letterbox in <br/>
question by wrapping them with leaves/grass, twigs) before returning <br/>
them to their hiding spots.  Even, take a little extra time to <br/>
really ensure it's well hidden before they depart--like not building <br/>
the 'tell-tale letterbox altar' out of adjacent sticks but rather to <br/>
recover them so they look natural, casting a little <br/>
dirt/leaves/twigs over them so it looks as if nothing were there, <br/>
that sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to hear your thoughts on this matter.  How can we reduce <br/>
this problem???  It's a subject that's really starting to frustrate <br/>
me--to the point I'm even considering taking time off from the hobby <br/>
for a LONG while.  Please no flames--this isn't intended to cause an <br/>
uproar or to blame anybody--I'm just looking for ideas to help <br/>
resolve this problem.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance--<br/>

We share your frustration. Since we Googled here mostly go 'boxing in <br/>
a group, we do second checks of each other's rehiding the box. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, after you plant a few, you realize how precious they are. Sort <br/>
of like having kids, you only realize their worth until you have some <br/>
of your own.<br/>
<br/>
If I find a box that I think is poorly hidden, I try to make sure it <br/>
has more cover before I leave. I also try to contact the placer and <br/>
let them know.<br/>
<br/>
Solution? I am not sure. I think it is VERY worth discussing. And I <br/>
sincerely doubt you will draw any flames from anyone on this. Our <br/>
boxes and stamps are precious. Let's keep them well hidden.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Hi fellow letterbox-placers/finders around the country!<br/>
<br/>
  I'm starting to grow rather frustrated by a hobby that I had been <br/>
  really enjoying up til now.  This frustration has been stewing for <br/>
  several months but I just haven't figured out how to adequately <br/>
  address it without causing an uproar.  <br/>
  ______________<br/>
  Well, the first rule of not causing an uproar is not to come off as a pompous patutti.  You did well. :-)<br/>
  __________<br/>
<br/>
  Problem Background:  Over the past several months, I've gone out to <br/>
  check up on several letterboxes that we'd placed during our <br/>
  letterboxing adventure or to seek letterboxes that other folks had <br/>
  placed.  Upon finding the letterbox (if it still happened to be <br/>
  there) we noticed that many were 'carelessly rehidden' if they were <br/>
  even hidden at all.  <br/>
  __________<br/>
  I've seen this!  Warrior Woman and I found a series of boxes so exposed that it was a miracle they were still there.  The culprit(s)?  How do you know?  I can't imagine any 'boxer I know leaving them like this.  I've yet to meet a single letterboxer that acts callously towards boxes.  It had to be random finds by non-boxers who at least weren't destructive or thieves, or animals dragging the boxes out.  I rather doubt that anyone, even a brand-newbie, would be leaving boxes around like that.  So I don't think that FAQs or threats of letterboxing gods would do any good.<br/>
  ___________<br/>
  I'm not sure how to address this subject anymore than we've already <br/>
  attempted.  We include a blurb in the clues about requesting <br/>
  letterboxers to look discreetly &amp; carefully for the letterbox and to ensure that it is rehidden out of view of passersby when they are <br/>
  through. <br/>
  _______________<br/>
  That little blurb might elicit a *duh* from many finders but it doesn't hurt to remind.  <br/>
  ___________<br/>
<br/>
  Most of our letterboxes are camouflaged (minus the few <br/>
  initial ones we placed we haven't yet improved upon over time) but <br/>
  more &amp; more even the camouflaged ones are walking away these days.  <br/>
  I'm not sure if folks tend to be more 'protective' of other peoples' letterboxes once they've started placing them themselves or what the issue is.  I know that I personally really started to get that 'mother hen' feeling when I started finding letterboxes AFTER I had placed some of my own.<br/>
  _________<br/>
  Not me.  I treat them all the same and have from the get-go.  And fortunately most finders have been very kind and careful with the one box I had planted up until last month.  <br/>
  _______<br/>
  Sometimes, I'll come across a letterbox and really have a sinking feeling about its hiding spot because it might seem really vulnerable.  I try to leave it as well hidden as possible, but knowing that it might not survive regardless of how well hidden it is--it's hard to part with it.  If that's the case, I try to contact the placer to let them know it may not last long in the same hiding spot.<br/>
  _________________<br/>
  That's the best you can do, I think, and the best we could all do for each other.  What I don't like is when the boxes are moved without the placer's knowledge.  My box was taken out of its niche in the rear of a wall and someone put it into the end of the wall.  Heaven knows who yanked out all the rocks at the end of the wall. Was it the person who "fixed" my location? Or was it yet another searcher getting frustrated with the box not being where they thought it should be?  All I know is that it was *less* concealed and not where the clues said it should be.  I was thankful it was all there, unharmed.  I shrugged it off because ultimately no real harm was done and my box was there.  I haven't had the heartbreak of losing one, other than my HH.  BTW, has ANYONE seen my Quahog?<br/>
  ____________<br/>
<br/>
  I understand that animals and outdoor conditions often dislodge/nudge' letterboxes from their hiding spots but often <br/>
  the letterboxes we've come across that were 'haphazardly rehidden' <br/>
  had had letterboxers visit them either the same day or just a short <br/>
  time before we visited them so the possibility of outside influences dislodging them has been rather small. Yes, I've lost several <br/>
  letterboxes to gardeners, squirrels, rains, vandals, schoolkids who <br/>
  tore a nurse stump to SHREDS, homeless folks who like to pull bark <br/>
  off of trees, other treasure hunters, etc--yes, many were just poor <br/>
  placements. Others, however, are missing because they weren't <br/>
  rehidden carefully.  <br/>
  ________<br/>
  How do you really know for sure?<br/>

  I'd love to hear your thoughts on this matter.  How can we reduce <br/>
  this problem???  It's a subject that's really starting to frustrate <br/>
  me--to the point I'm even considering taking time off from the hobby for a LONG while. <br/>
  ________<br/>
  Maybe just a little break is all you need.  I'd hate to see you just quit.<br/>
  ________<br/>
   Please no flames--this isn't intended to cause an <br/>
  uproar or to blame anybody--I'm just looking for ideas to help <br/>
  resolve this problem.<br/>

  Alas, I don't think I can offer any more ideas than you have come up with yourself. "Please re-hide CAREFULLY" should really be all that's necessary if it's not animals leaving things out in the open.<br/>

"replace as found", I'm not sure what else you can do.<br/>
My concern and frustration goes beyond people not<br/>
re-hiding letterboxes well.  My main frustration<br/>
is that no matter how well you hide a box and no matter<br/>
how well finders replace it, that box will eventually<br/>
turn up missing and become a "litterbox".  When I first<br/>
started this hobby I had grandiose plans of placing<br/>
letterboxes that would be around long after I'm gone.<br/>
Now I realize I will be lucky if they make it a few years.<br/>
I've started making more microboxes in an attempt to reduce<br/>
the impact on the environment, but even these can be found<br/>
by animals or non-letterboxers.  So far I have dutifully<br/>
replaced all my boxes that have gone missing if I can<br/>
get to them easily.  Other boxes that are virtual orphans<br/>
I have turned into "online" boxes.  This is a box that<br/>
can still be "found" by visiting the site where the box<br/>
used to be and then downloading a copy of the stamp image<br/>
from my clue page.  I may start doing this for all my<br/>
boxes that turn up missing.  Might not be as much fun<br/>
for the finder, but it still counts as a find and they<br/>
still get a stamp image for their logbook.  They can even<br/>
write comments on my webpage logbook instead of a real logbook<br/>
in the letterbox.  Anyway, that is my "solution".<br/>
<br/>
Another alternative is to become an Ecoscavenger:<br/>

Wish I had a better solution.<br/>

&gt;   Sent: Monday, September 22, 2003 6:13 PM<br/>
&gt;   Subject: [LbNA] Frustrated LB placer questions...<br/>
&gt;   Problem Background:  Over the past several months, I've gone <br/>
out  <br/>
&gt;   to check up on several letterboxes that we'd placed during our <br/>
&gt;   letterboxing adventure or to seek letterboxes that other folks <br/>
had <br/>
&gt;   placed.  Upon finding the letterbox (if it still happened to be <br/>
&gt;   there) we noticed that many were 'carelessly rehidden' if they <br/>
were <br/>
&gt;   even hidden at all.  <br/>
&gt;   __________<br/>
&gt;   I've seen this!  Warrior Woman and I found a series of boxes so <br/>
exposed that it was a miracle they were still there.  The culprit<br/>
(s)?  How do you know?  I can't imagine any 'boxer I know leaving <br/>
them like this.  I've yet to meet a single letterboxer that acts <br/>
callously towards boxes.  It had to be random finds by non-boxers <br/>
who at least weren't destructive or thieves, or animals dragging the <br/>
boxes out.  I rather doubt that anyone, even a brand-newbie, would <br/>
be leaving boxes around like that.  So I don't think that FAQs or <br/>
threats of letterboxing gods would do any good.<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;&gt;I'm glad your box didn't go missing.  I've had many <br/>
similar 'close calls' with boxes but fortunately either I or some <br/>
other courteous boxer was able to check up on it and rescue it <br/>
before its impending doom.  As for the most recent experience, the <br/>
previous finders had only been there hours before, the clue offered <br/>
very specific and detailed hiding spot instructions, yet it was left <br/>
there totally exposed in a precarious spot not even remotely close <br/>
to what the clues said.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't had the heartbreak of losing one, other than my HH.  BTW, <br/>
has ANYONE seen my Quahog?<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;&gt;I've lost a couple dozen now for various reasons.  A few have a <br/>
tendency to go missing almost immediately after I get a comment that <br/>
somebody recently found it.  That's mostly the info I'm going off <br/>
of.  I haven't heard from over 10 HHs we've launched over the past <br/>
year &amp; a half.  Sadly, I consider most of them dead or buried.  :(  <br/>
The others I imagine are hanging out in those very rarely checked <br/>
letterboxes out there.  I've only received about 5 updates of any of <br/>
the hitchhikers I've ever planted--those were mostly from people <br/>
with whom I routinely exchange messages.  I gather this is the <br/>
reason that many people aren't launching hitchhikers all that often <br/>
anymore.  I've launched 1 in the past 6 months and that was only <br/>
because it was a very special location where we were and I thought <br/>
it would be neat to see where it would travel next after that locale.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   I understand that animals and outdoor conditions often <br/>
dislodge/nudge' letterboxes from their hiding spots but often <br/>
&gt;   the letterboxes we've come across that were 'haphazardly <br/>
rehidden' <br/>
&gt;   had had letterboxers visit them either the same day or just a <br/>
short <br/>
&gt;   time before we visited them so the possibility of outside <br/>
influences dislodging them has been rather small. Yes, I've lost <br/>
several <br/>
&gt;   letterboxes to gardeners, squirrels, rains, vandals, schoolkids <br/>
who <br/>
&gt;   tore a nurse stump to SHREDS, homeless folks who like to pull <br/>
bark <br/>
&gt;   off of trees, other treasure hunters, etc--yes, many were just <br/>
poor <br/>
&gt;   placements. Others, however, are missing because they weren't <br/>
&gt;   rehidden carefully.  <br/>
&gt;   ________<br/>
&gt;   How do you really know for sure?<br/>
<br/>
Again, refer to above example, we checked on a box fairly early in <br/>
the day, noting in the logbook that other finders had only just <br/>
earlier been there (unless they box in the dark), the LB was totally <br/>
exposed, not in the hiding spot even though the directions in the <br/>
clues were rather explicit!  This is just one example of many, many, <br/>
many occasions where I've experienced this.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   ________<br/>
&gt;   <snipped><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I'd love to hear your thoughts on this matter.  How can we <br/>
reduce <br/>
&gt;   this problem???  It's a subject that's really starting to <br/>
frustrate <br/>
&gt;   me--to the point I'm even considering taking time off from the <br/>
hobby for a LONG while. <br/>
&gt;   ________<br/>
&gt;   Maybe just a little break is all you need.  I'd hate to see you <br/>
just quit.<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;&gt;Boxes continue to disappear despite efforts to better <br/>
hide/camouflage them and I'm deciding to not replace many of them.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   Alas, I don't think I can offer any more ideas than you have <br/>
come up with yourself. "Please re-hide CAREFULLY" should really be <br/>
all that's necessary if it's not animals leaving things out in the <br/>
open.<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;&gt;Including anything in the clue sheet doesn't seem to help.  <br/>
Discussing it on the message board isn't working either as many area <br/>
letterboxers aren't active on this site--although they're quite <br/>
active in the region.  That's why I think our only shot at <br/>
really 'teaching' anybody to be careful with rehiding boxes is <br/>
addressing it in some manner in a FAQ or other area where new folks <br/>
go first to learn about letterboxing before they venture out for <br/>
their first find.<br/>

&gt;   Thanks in advance--<br/>

If <br/>
&gt;   so, what are your ideas/recommendations for improving it? Any <br/>
&gt;   comments are greatly appreciated--either directly to me or to <br/>
the <br/>

<br/>
Thanks for your insightful comments.  Just looking for ideas out <br/>
there.  One thing I've started to do is tether my letterboxes to the <br/>
hiding spots--using a very small tether that won't damage the plants <br/>
or the item around which it is tethered nor will it injure any <br/>
animals that may come upon it (I'm mostly referring to 35 mm film <br/>
canister sized letterboxes here).  I figure the tether would <br/>
indicate where the 'exact intended' hiding spot is.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate any other ideas you may have!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, Sileagle--great comments.  One thing I try to do to reduce the <br/>
impact our hobby has on the environment (besides carefully treading <br/>
where ever we are letterboxing) is to use recycled containers for my <br/>
letterbox containers.  From film canisters to tupperware rescued <br/>
from St Vincent de Paul, Goodwill, Salvation Army to VHS Cassette <br/>
Cases from the Boeing Surplus Yard (thank you Trial N Error for the <br/>
info on that bargain of a lifetime!!!), I figure I'm saving a little <br/>
bit of space in area dumps.  I also don't want to detract from an <br/>
individual's outdoors experience by seeing some 'fluorescent' <br/>
tupperware sticking up out of the ground--so I've really tried to <br/>
camouflage my letterboxes lately so as not to ruin somebody's <br/>
unpolluted date with nature. ;)  Yes, we're tired of stumbling <br/>
across dumped tires/wheels, fridges, you name it out there on the <br/>
trails...<br/>
<br/>
Like Steve of Team Rayvenhaus said in a previous message, we just <br/>
need to take LOADS of trash out with us on our hunts and if you ever <br/>
come across other hikers/outdoor adventurers that witness you doing <br/>
it, it might be a great time to tell them about letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your comments.  We'll definitely look into the <br/>
ecoscavenge concept.  I've hidden several 'offset' letterboxes <br/>
already that, if placed where I'd originally intended, they wouldn't <br/>
be welcomed by the resident officials.  So, I've drafted clues that <br/>
require you to visit an area then after solving some problems there, <br/>
it leads you to the hiding spot in another park in another area <br/>
where you find the letterbox.<br/>

into their hiding spot to discourage critters, which seem to be the most<br/>
common culprit around here (as evidenced by the teeth marks - or we have<br/>
very hungry boxers!). For a few of my microboxes, I have created a small<br/>
depression (the size of the container) in the ground and laid a rock on top.<br/>
The small depression allows the rock to sit flush with the ground and a few<br/>
leaves tossed on top makes them blend right in. For areas without a lot of<br/>
rocks, I do this inside a tree stump or at the base of a tree (on the back<br/>
side away from the trail) where a single rock covered by natural debris<br/>
wouldn't draw attention. It seems to work really well. The critters can't<br/>
get to them, they can be placed right at the trail's edge (as long as it<br/>
blends in with the surroundings-other rocks around) and they aren't likely<br/>
to get washed away. I don't know how well it would work for regular size<br/>
boxes though, the depression would just have to be larger.<br/>

Regarding what you posted below: Would the tether force the boxer to stamp<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for bringing this up dvn2rckr, it is something that has weighed on my<br/>
mind, specifically since we went and walked the Snow Dogs series yesterday,<br/>
finding 2 missing, which, effectively breaks the ability to find the others,<br/>
as they go from one to the others, though I am sure that many will be able<br/>
to continue on until I am able to recarve them.  These are our first missing<br/>
boxes that we've created.<br/>
<br/>
In walking the series yesterday,  I noticed one thing... Most of the boxes<br/>
were in less than desirable hiding positions.. One was even lying in the<br/>
trail, open.  My opinion?  Teenagers were i the forest, doing what teenagers<br/>
do and they stumbled across the boxes, and, apparently can't read the<br/>
requested glued into each box as to what it is and to please replace it.  I<br/>
think that most Letterboxers tend to take care of things... Both the<br/>
environment and the hidden box itself... I tend to believe that the problems<br/>
we encounter is simply random chance... Someone saw us replace the box and<br/>
being curious, they investigated and left it less than hidden when they<br/>
departed, or, teens stumbled across them whilst doing whatever it is<br/>
teenagers do in the woods, and, having not been taught respect for<br/>
themselves, let alone other peoples property. Last but not least, we have<br/>
the environment itself, the weather and the critters.<br/>
<br/>
All of this stacks the deck against us.  I thought of this before I started<br/>
on the hobby and I decided that as long as I could afford it, I would carve<br/>
my boxes and I would plant them and I would replace them as needed.  I don't<br/>
like is, specially when I see human remnants on the trail in the vicinity of<br/>
the recently lost letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I look at it this way..... Personally, I'm not one to get upset over the<br/>
lost letterbox.  I'll just re-create it, better than it was before as my<br/>
carving ability improves with each one I do. The careless hiding though....<br/>
That bothers me. That careless disregard for the basics of the 'game' lead<br/>
me to believe that some are doing this simply for the bragging rights.  And,<br/>
in my NOT so humble opinion, that's the wrong reason.<br/>
<br/>
We're at a turning point here folks.  See, I know the 'No rules' part of<br/>
letterboxing, but that anarchy is what is causing the growing pains.  I'm<br/>
not advocating that we detail the simplest manner, from how a booklet must<br/>
be made, to what stamps are acceptable.  I am advocating that we teach by<br/>
example. That we follow the golden rule and that we teach our children to be<br/>
different than the masses.<br/>
<br/>
Are we going to know if the last person to visit our letterbox hid it well<br/>
enough or not? Nope.  We'll never know. But, by constantly pointing everyone<br/>
to the FAQ's, by continuing to educate and teach, by doing it better<br/>
ourselves, we can teach by example and by that nature, we can set down, not<br/>
rules, but what's acceptable behaviors on the trail and in search of the<br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, to dvnr2ckr, whom I look up to, please don't get discouraged, yours<br/>
are some of the most enjoyable boxes we have had the pleasure of searching<br/>
out and those of us in the PNW would be hard pressed to have as much fun as<br/>
we do, it you stopped placing/replacing boxes here.  And that goes for every<br/>
single letterboxer out there.  Without the placers, the finders have no<br/>
where to go, nothing to find. I personally want to thank every single person<br/>
that has taken the plunge to create something and to place it.  Without you,<br/>
we'd (Team Rayvenhaus) would be merely hiking these trails, and, as<br/>
wonderful as that can be and is, the added pleasure of seeking something,<br/>
working the 'problem' through and deciphering the clues, only makes the<br/>
journey that much more sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Let me share this last thought..........<br/>
<br/>
Far to many people feel that the goal is the destination, the prize. I say<br/>
it is not. I say that, perhaps, it is the journey that matters. It's not the<br/>
getting there that matters as much as how you arrived there.   So, to us,<br/>
it's not the box at the end of the hike, the stamp to add to the book,<br/>
though those are part and parcel of what we do, it is, to us, a means to<br/>
educate our children in nature.  So show them the wonder of the planet that<br/>
sustains us and the circle of life.  The letterbox at the end, the goal, is<br/>
only a sweet victory because my children got to see a nest full of baby<br/>
robins, an eagle soaring majestically, a Doe and 2 fawns hidden in the<br/>
thicket, the caterpillar building his cocoon, the salmon fighting their way<br/>
upstream to spawn and explaining to them what spawning is. (grin)<br/>
<br/>
That's what counts to us. So, to every single person who has or will plant a<br/>
letterbox and checks them and hides them yet again, who replaces the ones<br/>
that the vandals destroyed, I say thank you more than mere words can<br/>
express. Thank you for showing me a way to get my children interested in<br/>
nature and away from the boob tube.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

Cool ideas about indenting the small containers.  I haven't tried <br/>
that with the film canisters yet.  May do so in the future.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
As for the tethers, the letterboxes are connected to the tethers via <br/>
a detachable metal ring.  The letterboxer locates the letterbox, <br/>
carefully opens the ring to release the letterbox, takes it to <br/>
another location to stamp in and then carefully reattaches it to the <br/>
waiting tether.  The tether is thin gauge wire (used for hanging <br/>
picture frames from picture railing--ok, we live in a VERY OLD <br/>
house) and is carefully placed around the item to leave just a tiny <br/>
1-2 inch gap to allow for reattaching it.  As I'm an avid gardener, <br/>
I've very cautious in avoiding injury to whatever I'm placing a <br/>
tether on--the container is usually a 35 mm film canister or a <br/>
tupperware hamburger patty container--so it's not that large and not <br/>
very heavy, either.  So far, I've tethered a box to a fern and <br/>
another to a very secure/stable tree root from a dead log.  We'll <br/>
see how long they last--knock on wood!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I've also resorted to using Christmas tree ornament type letterboxes-<br/>
-again, usually 35 mm film canisters that I created a sort of hook <br/>
either with the thin gauge wire or large paperclips--that I wrap <br/>
with electrical tape.  If you make the 'hook' large enough, the <br/>
letterboxes usually don't get dislodged from their hiding spots <br/>
during high winds or heavy rains (haven't experienced any hurricanes <br/>
yet so I'm not sure how they'll fare then).<br/>
<br/>
It's funny you mention tree stumps--I've lost about 5 letterboxes to <br/>
rotting tree stumps.  They somehow get swallowed up into the tree's <br/>
belly!  I've even lost a letterbox to a tree stump turned into a <br/>
seat at a local park.  Talk about funny LB disappearance stories.  <br/>
More along that line--I placed a letterbox awhile back in a hole in <br/>
a tree fairly high up in the tree.  Future letterboxers kept <br/>
reporting that they'd find it on the ground below the tree.  I'd <br/>
check on it, put it back in its hole and still get similar reports.  <br/>
Well, eventually I checked it again, it had tiny bite marks on its <br/>
lid and I realized I had been fighting a squirrel! Needless to say, <br/>
I lost the fight, moved the box to another location and <br/>
unfortunately, it was swallowed by the tree stump at its new <br/>
location.  Craziness!  So, now I'm much more cautious about tree <br/>
stumps &amp; old logs.<br/>
<br/>
You know, the funny hiding places I've had the most success with <br/>
lately have been under large bushy ferns!  As long as you use dark <br/>
containers (black/brown VHS cassette cases or disk cases seem to <br/>
work best) they seem to fare quite well!<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks for your ideas!<br/>

Yes, it's demoralizing when a box goes missing--but understandable.  <br/>
The thing that gets my goat is when letterboxers are careless in <br/>
rehiding the box.  I totally understand the other reasons for boxes <br/>
disappearing--it's just careful rehiding may really reduce the <br/>
frequency that they go missing or are accidentally stumbled upon.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to hear about some of the Snow Dogs escaping.  Yes, I ran <br/>
across many interesting &amp; gross things in the park there--to include <br/>
possibly somebody's home--blanket, clothing, shoes &amp; all?  We can <br/>
only do so much to ensure our surroundings are maintained--I applaud <br/>
everybody who attempts to make a dent in the problem!<br/>
<br/>
Ditto--extending thanks to all letterbox placers out there!  What an <br/>
incredible wild ride this has been--leading us to so many incredible <br/>
and unknown hidden treasures around the country--and learning so <br/>
much in the process!  I also laud the careful and courteous <br/>
letterboxers out there--keep up the great work!<br/>

One thing that I have found in my own letterboxing quests is that a box<br/>
often looks very well hidden to me, but when I get up to go and see it from<br/>
a different angle, it is quite exposed.  This is especially prone to<br/>
happening when I am hiding under large rocks-it may be hidden on the finding<br/>
side, but I don't realize there is a gap on the far side.<br/>
<br/>
I have taken to walking around a plant site to see if I can see the box<br/>
differently from other angles before I leave.  I think it is good advice for<br/>
any to follow.<br/>

I'm toying with the idea of placing letterboxes in 'canvas' sleeves <br/>
so as to better camouflage them.  I'll try to explore an Army Navy <br/>
Surplus store sometime and see if there are any old cheap waterproof <br/>
tents/camo nets/other type of canvas materials that could easily be <br/>
used to create a sleeve (much like taking a piece of cardboard, <br/>
folding it in half and stapling three sides)--wonder if that would <br/>
help?  Has anybody tried anything like this before?  Even just <br/>
getting scraps of an old camo net that you could wrap around your <br/>
box and then insert random organic materials into the netting so it <br/>
looks more natural might work, huh?<br/>

&gt; Cool ideas about indenting the small containers.  <br/>
<br/>
I've lifted rocks out of the ground and put micro-boxes in it's place.  <br/>
-----<br/>
<br/>
The micro-boxes I use are 50ML centrifuge tubes that withstand boiling<br/>
water and -70F, so as long as I place heavy stones on top to keep the<br/>
tube from washing away I think it should be OK.<br/>
-------<br/>
<br/>
&gt; As for the tethers, the letterboxes are connected to the tethers via <br/>
&gt; a detachable metal ring.  The letterboxer locates the letterbox, <br/>
&gt; carefully opens the ring to release the letterbox, takes it to <br/>
&gt; another location to stamp in and then carefully reattaches it to the <br/>
&gt; waiting tether. <br/>
<br/>
You really are depending on people finding the box to be gentle.<br/>
------<br/>
&gt; The tether is thin gauge wire (used for hanging <br/>
&gt; picture frames from picture railing--ok, we live in a VERY OLD <br/>
&gt; house) <br/>
<br/>
You could use wire made for bead stringing such as "Soft Flex" or<br/>
other brand names which has 49 stainless steel wires twisted and<br/>
encased in a thin plastic sheath.  Eventually the stuff wears out but<br/>
it is strong and is more protected than picture wire because of the<br/>
plastic.  It or something similar is avaible in Michaels or other<br/>
crafts stores or online at places like www.jsritter.com under: Tools &amp;<br/>
Equipment &gt; Bead Stringing Supplies.   This can be tied in a knot,<br/>
although if you use a square knot be sure to use one extra knot<br/>
otherwise it will slip off.<br/>
