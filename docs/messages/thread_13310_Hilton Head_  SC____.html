                    <div class="plaintext-content">We returned from a week in Hilton Head.  Are the 3 letterboxes still<br/>
there on Pinckney Island?  We attempted to find them, but failed <br/>
miserably.  I was a little freaked out by the alligators watching me <br/>
and the thought of all the snakes lurking in the bushes.  <br/>
<br/>
We did plant some boxes in Hilton Head, but if anyone plans on <br/>
heading out there this summer please let me know because I might need <br/>
you to rehide our boxes.  After we left the island we saw the weather <br/>
report reminding us of Hurricane season approaching.  I don't think <br/>
that 3 of the 4 hiding spots will last long if that's the case.  I'll <br/>
post the clues this week.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks.  <br/>
