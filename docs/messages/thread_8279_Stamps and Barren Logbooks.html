<br/>
Although I am of the opinion that not seeing the stamp before finding <br/>
a box adds to the intrigue of the overall seek and discovery <br/>
experience, I also consider the art of stamp carving to be an <br/>
interesting hobby of itself, and worthy of sharing.<br/>
<br/>
And since I am living and we are planting the majority of our boxes <br/>
in West Michigan, where letterboxers are few and far between, it is <br/>
conceivable that many of our boxes will weather the cold Michigan <br/>
winter with barren logbooks. So to give a little peeksy as to what <br/>
one may expect to find should they happen to be passing by this way <br/>
(does anyone ever just happen to be passing through Michigan?) and <br/>
have the opportunity to engage in a little letterboxing, I have <br/>
posted a few stamps to the files area. Not that my stamps would be <br/>
so desirable as to lure one here, but also consider that Mirkwood has <br/>
some very interesting clues and stamps on the east side of the state, <br/>
and that Michigan in itself is a really cool state to visit... <br/>
<br/>
Enough said. Hope to see some of you soon.<br/>

It has been so hard to keep from going to peek at these images in the<br/>
files! But, lucky me! I'm going to Michigan to visit my old stomping<br/>
grounds and will be hunting for boxes in the Traverse City area next<br/>
weekend, so I'm hoping to see them in person. (I love surprises!) :)<br/>
You'll have a couple more entries in the logbooks we find before the snows<br/>
set in, anyway. <br/>
<br/>
My sister and I are plotting and planning a couple of plants in that area,<br/>
too.  I think I have the Treefrog just about hooked on letterboxing!<br/>

other 'boxers (not part of your entourage) along the trail.  I was <br/>
hoping when I was on the east coast last month I might meet up with <br/>
someone and be able to put a number behind my "X".  Several of the <br/>
boxes I visited had recent visitors, just none at the same time as me.<br/>
<br/>
As you have probably already figured out, P is number of boxes placed <br/>
(including hitchhikers you created and put out) and F is number of <br/>
boxes found (including hitchhikers you find).<br/>
<br/>
I am excited to see your boxes...  I would like to head over that way <br/>
and try to get the Independence Oaks boxes yet before winter...  I <br/>
could swing north and do yours also.  Anxious to see the haunted <br/>
one...  I have an idea what it might be...<br/>

&gt; I'm from/in Michigan and new to letterboxing (found my first box in<br/>
&gt; Aug.) I'm from Saginaw, so the nearest boxes for me are over 100<br/>
&gt; miles away (the ones in Wayne Co., Oakland Co., etc.). I've found 4<br/>
&gt; of 5 at Indepenant Oaks Park. (Missed the one titled "Independant<br/>
&gt; Oak". Think I started in the wrong area (the ampitheater) because the<br/>
&gt; clues didn't come out right. Will have to try this one again.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also found the 2 in Cross Winds Marsh, April Fools, and Snowflake.<br/>
&gt; I intend to get over to the west side of the state (and up north) but<br/>
&gt; since those are even farther away, it'll be awhile before I get<br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'm working on placing boxes in my (the Saginaw Co./Bay Co.) area. I<br/>
&gt; have ideas/places (and am working on clues &amp; stamps) for 8 so far, 3<br/>
&gt; individual ones and a series of 5.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I've been practicing carving -- and found I have NO talent. So far it<br/>
&gt; looks like something a 5 yr old would do :-( . So until I can<br/>
&gt; get "good enough" at this (so you can at least tell what it' suppose<br/>
&gt; to be) I have bought a couple of stamps (that fit the place/theme<br/>
&gt; perfectly) and commissioned ?sp? a couple. I hope to have the 3 out<br/>
&gt; before Halloween (especially since one of them is "haunted").<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a question. What does the X stand for in people's counts? I've<br/>
&gt; figured out the others (from reading the archived posts).<br/>

&gt; &gt; Thanks Jay, it is nice to get feedback, especially from one of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; true master carvers.  But what I really long for is stamps in my<br/>
&gt; log<br/>
&gt; &gt; books.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; How's that for a warped sense of priorities?<br/>
