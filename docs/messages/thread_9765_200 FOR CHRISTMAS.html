                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today we hit F-200 actually 202,but we wanted to hit it by xmas and we did, ironically are 200th was Pine for you LB,and it was a stamp of a little christmas tree.We also did Eagleville Dam and got to meet Buck&amp;Duck Master and Fireman 2-B very nice people we got to talk for awhile Irish mum was not with them,too bad we would like to have met her too.As far as wild animals I love them but you never know what they're going to do.When we go hiking I always carry my 38,a can of pepper spray and I always have my walking stick.There has been lots of times walking down a trail that there has been a snake, once a snapping turtle or some kind of thing crossing our path.Fisrt I give them some room and go around them,this is their house not mine.second I have my walking stick just in case they get a little to curious I can guide them away.Third if they get aggressive I will try to deter them with pepper spray.And fourth and I hope this never has to happen but if I feel that it is life threatening then I will have no choice but to defend myself and wife and put that animal down.I grew up on a farm and you can read an animal sometimes on what their intentions are by looking in their eyes or watching their body language,But still you never know,NEVER TURN YOUR BACK TO THEM always keep them in sight and let them know it.99% of the time we're out hiking we're just having fun and enjoying nature,But there's always that 1% that will get you if you're not ready for it,they say it's better to have it and not need it,then to need it and not have it.I've had a hand gun permit since 1994 and thank God other than target practice I never had to use it.Lenny/Kathy                                                        F-202  P-12  X-8  T-5                                                                                     <br/>
