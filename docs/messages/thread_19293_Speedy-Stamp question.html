I use a small travel iron. Set it on high and then hold for 5-10 seconds. The heat <br/>
transfer method works very well, especially with speedy stamp carving material. It <br/>
also works well for mastercarve, but makes it a bit mushy - just put the carving <br/>
block in the freezer for a few minutes - Brian swears by this! <br/>
<br/>
So, try the heat transfer method using the iron. It works so well for lettering.<br/>
<br/>
I usually go through quite a process myself. I usually draw an image, scan it in, add <br/>
text, print to the lasser printer, and then transfer. That seems to take much more <br/>
time than the actual carving itself! <br/>
<br/>

Your stamps are incredible as personal stamps - Gatherer and Dawnlander - just <br/>
wanted you folks to know that we've seen them here and there, and every time they <br/>
take my breath away!  It's so nice to see some good carving! :-)<br/>

  &gt; for me so far.  <br/>
  --snip--<br/>
  &gt;  The iron <br/>
  &gt; heat transfer method doesnt leave<br/>
  &gt; the carving area as sticky, i just <br/>
  &gt; keep the iron moving over the paper,<br/>
  &gt; after 30 seconds I lift a corner <br/>
  &gt; to be sure it's transfered, if it<br/>

  &gt; It's amazing the detail you can get.<br/>

I only said "high heat" because I have a very small travel iron, and unless it is on the <br/>

I'm happy it just works in the first place ;-) <br/>

For a "regular iron" I think you'd probably do well with medium heat - unless you <br/>
like your rubber sticky...<br/>

I agree with the zen cooking comment... that's probably the best <br/>
