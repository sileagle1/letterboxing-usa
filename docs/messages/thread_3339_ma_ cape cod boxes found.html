                    <div class="plaintext-content">I spent this past weekend on the Cape and took the opportunity to find<br/>
several letterboxes.  The following are all alive and well:<br/>
<br/>
     The Reunion<br/>
     Chatham Light<br/>
     Highland Light<br/>
     Nauset Light<br/>
<br/>
I looked for Three Women Singing (Light, Love, &amp; Joy), but it appears to<br/>
have gone missing.  I'm 95% certain I found the right spot, but the area<br/>
has been recently cleared of underbrush, and the tree that I identified as<br/>
apple is dead or dying, with a small drift of termite-created sawdust at<br/>
the base.  One branch of the trunk has snapped off and I don't think the<br/>
rest of the tree will stand for much longer.  No box was in evidence within<br/>
a 15-foot radius of the tree.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to Leader of the Pack, Lonemasswolf, and You Inspire My Spirit<br/>
for helping to enliven my Cape Cod weekend!  I look forward to meeting you<br/>
all in October!<br/>
