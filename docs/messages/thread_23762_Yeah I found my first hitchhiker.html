                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was in Colorado and the friend I was visiting wanted to go to Pikes<br/>
Peak. She had never been letterboxing and I figured there was proabbly<br/>
a good chance there was one in the area. I called up my honey back at<br/>
home and had him e-mail the clues to one in the park to my blackberry<br/>
so - She found her first letter box but also ended up finding Armchair<br/>
Detective's Bless my Little Heart HH. It was so random but I was<br/>
confused becuase the box it was at didn't have a stamp. We sorted<br/>
everything out - the original boxes journal had tons of notes asking<br/>
about where the stamp was. I didn't have my stamp but I signed it and<br/>
so did my friend. I wound up bringing the thing all the way back to<br/>
the east coast. I feel so lucky- this was only my 5th box ever anyway.<br/>
