Mad Hatter's Hitchhiker Hostel, 2.5 stars<br/>
SE PA mystery box<br/>
http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box52.html<br/>
<br/>
I created 9 hitchhikers.  I needed a place to put one of them, so<br/>
I created a hitchhiker hostel.  The idea is to take a hitchhiker,<br/>
leave a hitchhiker, and write about it in the logbook (with apologies<br/>
to Dave Ulmer).  If you don't have a hitchhiker to drop off, you can<br/>
still visit the box, but you're supposed to leave the HH there for<br/>
someone who can make an exchange.  There are two logbooks, one for <br/>
HH stamps, and one for personal stamps.<br/>
<br/>
The good news for you number folks is that you can get an F2 for <br/>
finding this, as there should always be a HH here.  The bad news is <br/>
that you have to solve two sets of clues, as I have sponged off of <br/>
one of Shred's fine clues.  This way, I get a P2 for writing only <br/>
one set of clues :-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

Randy, I love this idea! People are "guaranteed" to find a hitch <br/>
hiker....but they already have to have one in their possesion...but <br/>
if they don't they can visit anyway without making an exchange...cool!<br/>
<br/>
I like that it's in a mystery spot, linked to another mystery box, as <br/>
well as a themed letterbox in its' own right.<br/>
<br/>
Oh just very well done indeed! Hope you don't mind if I shamelessly <br/>
plagurize it and plant one here in CT.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a terrific and creative addition to the letterboxing world.<br/>

Well of course :)  All ideas are open to reinterpretation, fusion, and<br/>
downright copying ...  I think some of my experiments would play really well <br/>
in a dense area like CT ... the playing field around here is a bit big ... <br/>
I mean, I've got 9 hitchhikers to get out, I'm sure I could do that in<br/>
Mansfield in about 10 minutes :-)<br/>
<br/>
... and the stamp for this box isn't too bad either, I'm committed to taking<br/>
the time to at least do decent stamps, tho not masterpieces of course, and <br/>
go back to all my old boxes and replace the lame ones.  If someone wants to <br/>
replace the stamps in my Oregon boxes (which are the lamest), feel free, I'm <br/>
not sure when I'll get out there again.<br/>
<br/>
Thx for your comments -- I have some other stuff in the hopper that might be<br/>
fun also ...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
<br/>
PS - my first HH find was F134.  Is that a record?  If you plant this box<br/>
in CT, my record lives forever :-)<br/>
