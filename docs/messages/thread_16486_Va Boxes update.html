We had a great Sunday this weekend, even though we only increased our "F"<br/>
count by one!<br/>
<br/>
We found the "Green Tea" box in Norfolk. It was there and in good shape, for<br/>
which we were thankful after the long roundabout way I steered us to it.<br/>
(oops!)<br/>
<br/>
While there, we planted a new box. We will have the clues up shortly.<br/>
<br/>
Then we headed of to Red Wing, to check up on the "Old Maid" and the<br/>
"Japanese Dragon". Much to our great surprise they both survived the<br/>
hurricane and the clean up crews.  We were a very happy car-ful on the ride<br/>
home!<br/>
<br/>
I just want to thank all the boxers who visited these boxes, as they have<br/>
converted my kids for life.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all, and happy boxing,<br/>
Kerri<br/>
