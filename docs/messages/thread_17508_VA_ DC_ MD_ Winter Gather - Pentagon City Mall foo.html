Pentagon City Mall food court<br/>
Arlington, VA<br/>
Saturday, January 24th<br/>
10:30am - 2:00pm or whenever (open to timing suggestions)<br/>
<br/>
Draft Agenda:<br/>
<br/>
- 10:00am - Organizers arrive and round up tables (Me and who else?)<br/>
- 10:30am - Letterboxers wandering around trying to find each <br/>
other. :-)<br/>
- 10:00am - 2:00pm - Ongoing exchanges everywhere.<br/>
- 11:00am - Welcome.  First of many introductions all around. Praise <br/>
and welcome for the out of towners.  Announcments.<br/>
- 11:30am - Food.  Try to beat the lines of teenage student <br/>
tourists.  Though that may be minimal in Jan.<br/>
- 1:00pm - Group picture.<br/>
- 1:15pm - hitchhiker exchange<br/>
<br/>
What else?<br/>
<br/>
The place is a little noisy to try to do a seminar though I hope many <br/>
will show samples of their crafts.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Randy Hall can come and sign his book?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone want to contribute an event stamp?  Do we need a theme?  The <br/>
mall isn't much of a theme to work with.  Arlington maybe.  I hope to <br/>
carve a new stamp for "It's A Holiday" which is very nearby.<br/>
<br/>
If there is interest I will make a booklet of nearby VA and DC <br/>
letterboxes which I'll pass out.  Though the intent of a winter <br/>
gather is more to get together and socialize than to box.<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone interested in a mystery dinner gathering that evening? If <br/>
only a couple people are interested I'll still organize it (because <br/>
that would make 3 of us).<br/>
<br/>
Looking for ideas, as always.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Scarab, You indicated that you might be flexible on the <br/>
timing. Are there any others who would like to push <br/>
this to later in the day? I can't be there before 2PM. <br/>
I wouldn't expect it to start that late, but if it went <br/>
from 12 - 3 or so I should be able to make it. I wouldn't<br/>
want to make it impossible for someone else so please <br/>
speak up about your preference.<br/>
<br/>
I do realize that it will be harder to stake out tables <br/>
at noon than earlier in the day.<br/>
<br/>
I have some homemade logbooks I would like to bring, but <br/>
I would hate to travel all that way only to find an <br/>
empty food court. I'd have to stop strangers and show <br/>
them my logbooks and stamp their hands.<br/>
