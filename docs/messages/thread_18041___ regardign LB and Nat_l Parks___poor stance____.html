<br/>
Appealing to the administration of the NPS to change rules that <br/>
prohibit us from us enjoying a hobby that has less environmental <br/>
impact than other permitted activities is not circumventing the <br/>
rules (http://www.m-w.com/ ). It is following standard procedures to <br/>
effect change. No one has proposed skullduggery or intrigue. Most <br/>
letterboxers maintain their boxes; they are not abandoned. The NPS <br/>
doesn't prohibit camping because of the few campers that leave trash <br/>
behind. Letterboxes can hardly be an eyesore given that concealing <br/>
them is the raison d'etre of letterboxing. Almost all mammals, bears <br/>
and raccoons included, locate food by scent then return to locations <br/>
where they've found food or seek out new sources being drawn to it <br/>
by scent, so I don't think that boxes are frequently mistaken for a <br/>
food source. All I suggest is that we educate the NPS about the <br/>
hobby and the numbers of participants and work out a compromise, why <br/>
not a simple system where boxes are registered with the park, if our <br/>
existing database is not simple enough for them, with a check off <br/>
system to show regular maintenance so they know that we are <br/>
monitoring them. I would like to see a system to ensure maintaince <br/>
of all boxes, unmaintained boxes annoy me too. They could even set a <br/>
limit on the number of boxes in a given park if they are worried <br/>
about excessive traffic. If Yosemite limits the numbers of campers <br/>
then limiting the number of letterboxes is acceptable. It seems <br/>
unfair however that the NPS goes to great lengths to accommodate <br/>
other activities, and not just accommodate but encourage through the <br/>
construction of permanent facilities for them, and then maintain <br/>
such a rigid stance against letterboxing. My letterbox left behind <br/>
cannot be as offensive as the porta-potty placed in the camping <br/>
areas. Other activities don't need to leave things behind for the <br/>
continued enjoyment of the activity by themselves and like minded <br/>
enthusiasts (abandoned using the same rationale used against <br/>
letterboxes)because the NPS puts them there for them! Maybe the <br/>
solution is to require the NPS to hide boxes and post clues for us...<br/>

I know that this was not addressed to Ryan, but for some reason I <br/>
thought of him( may be due to his chatter- although the Gods of <br/>
Letterboxing did answer my prayers). <br/>
<br/>
This could be Ryan's next adventure. I'm assuming that he isn't <br/>
trekking the Pacific Coast Trail this year or any other famous long <br/>
trails that are located in this world, and he is still independently <br/>
wealthy.<br/>

<br/>
Well, speaking as someone who has worked for years in a federal<br/>
regulatory agency, yes and no.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the Congress makes the ultimate rules, in the form of laws.  And<br/>
certainly a law passed by the Congress that specifically permitted or<br/>
prohibited letterboxing in national parks would dramatically affect<br/>
any discussion between the NPS and letterboxers.  But laws are<br/>
generally not that specific or detailed and, as a result, Congress<br/>
empowers federal agencies to develop and issue regulations to<br/>
implement the laws that Congress passes.  Regulations have the same<br/>
legal force of the law they implement but regulations are developed,<br/>
and can be modified, by the agency that is responsible for those<br/>
regulations, without the further involvement of Congress.  The<br/>
development of federal regulations must follow a very exacting<br/>
process, including public comment, but in the end it is the federal<br/>
agency that determines the requirements found in their regulations.<br/>
<br/>
And "policy" is an even more flexible concept.  Policy amounts to<br/>
further intepretation of a law or its regulations.  It might be<br/>
derived directly from the original law or the regulations, or it might<br/>
be no more than an expression of current thinking, political point of<br/>
view, preference, convenience or status quo on the part of the federal<br/>
agency involved in a question.  If neither law nor regulations speak<br/>
to a certain issue, then it may be resolved by policy.  And policy can<br/>
be changed at any time and for any reason.<br/>
<br/>
Telling us to go to Congress to change the rules is certainly a proper<br/>
suggestion but it is also a time-honored bureaucratic way to cut off<br/>
debate and discussion.  Typically it includes a strong element of "go<br/>
away and don't bother me," as I suspect was the case with the ranger<br/>
who made the suggestion.  <br/>
<br/>
So, no, one doesn't necessarily have to go to Congress to change the<br/>
rules.  A suggestion that "we educate the NPS ... and work out a<br/>
compromise" is entirely legitimate, could be fruitful, and certainly<br/>
is easier and faster.  Don't let the bureaucrats scare you off.<br/>
<br/>
The catch is that someone actually has to do it...<br/>
