Months ago, I had posted a link to the Smithsonian Letterboxing article to the volkmarching listserve and promptly forgot about it. Then yesterday I went to the Rubberstampmadness website and discovered the link to the UK letterboxing site quite by chance. I noted it and went back to work. This morning, I found a letter in my work inbox from Graham Howard, who had come up with my earlier volkmarching posting after doing a websearch on the keyword "letterboxing." He directed me to you!<br/>
<br/>
Now all of this is rather an odd twist of circumstances! So, in response to reading your earlier postings about how to promote the letterboxing interest, I'd like to add the category "odd twists of fate!"<br/>
<br/>
We're planning to get out on a hike this weekend, so maybe we'll scout out a letterbox location.  How much maintenance does a letterbox take?  Also, have you ever invited folk to leave their thoughts as well as their stamp in a letterbox book (much like folk do on registers on top of mountains)?  <br/>
<br/>
Well, this sounds great!  I can't wait to get started!<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to our group, Mary.  Very interesting story... I'm glad fate twisted<br/>
you in our direction (with some help from The Moorland Wizard, of course).<br/>
I'm also glad to hear that you were able to utilize our archive page to catch<br/>
up on earlier postings.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  We're planning to get out on a hike this weekend, so maybe we'll scout out<br/>
a <br/>
&gt; letterbox location.  How much maintenance does a letterbox take?<br/>
<br/>
Great!!  I'm sure you will find that ''perfect spot''.  A letterbox requires<br/>
very little maintenance.  Personally, though, I have to make a conscious<br/>
effort to convince myself not to run off and check on the ones near my house<br/>
every week.  Just knowing they are out there makes me long to go see if they<br/>
are OK and if anyone has visited them.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I have placed others in very remote areas that I almost<br/>
never return to.  Some of the ones I will be placing next season may very well<br/>
never be visited by me again.  Assuming that no damage or vandalism takes<br/>
place, the only maintenance that might eventually be required would be to<br/>
replace the guest book when it gets full, or possibly to restock the<br/>
information sheets that I enclosed.  Some people also like to leave self-<br/>
addressed stamped post cards in their boxes.  The remote locations I have in<br/>
mind, however, will likely not be visited often enough to fill the book for a<br/>
long time, and I doubt that I will be energetic enough to make it there more<br/>
than once in this lifetime!!! <br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Also, have you ever invited folk to <br/>
&gt; leave their thoughts as well as their stamp in a <br/>
&gt; letterbox book (much like folk do on registers on top of mountains)? <br/>
<br/>
Most definetely!!  I always jot a few notes in the book when I place a<br/>
letterbox, just to set the mood and encourage visitors to do likewise.  I<br/>
usually try to make a comment about the location or the theme of the box.<br/>
Sometimes, when I do make it out again to check on a box, I take a minute to<br/>
write a bit more.  Often, I find that other visitors have also written<br/>
something, even if it's just a simple greeting or a comment about what they<br/>
thought of my clues or letterboxing in general.  This really makes things more<br/>
interesting!!<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck on your hiking trip!<br/>
