We ran into some RI boxers who tried to find it 6/19/04 and said it was missing then too.  We did contact the placer but wanted to make sure anyone who might go looking would know.<br/>

even 2 (out of place) rocks behind the pole which looked like they <br/>

Unless you are the placer of the box, and know for sure it's missing,<br/>
you're safest saying you "couldn't find" it. False reports of missing<br/>
boxes, however well-intentioned, may keep others for looking for boxes<br/>
that are merely well-hidden.<br/>
<br/>
Hancock Hill is a notable example. Reported as "missing" by several<br/>
boxers over a period of more than a year, it was found exactly where<br/>
the clues said it would be.<br/>
