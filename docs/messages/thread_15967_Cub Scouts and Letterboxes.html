There's a box hidden in the park where we're having our pack campout next <br/>
month, and I'd planned to have our Webelos den carve their stamps tomorrow night <br/>
at the den meeting, and then go as a den to find the box when we camp out.<br/>
<br/>
My husband just raised a concern, however, that the boys, once they know the <br/>
box is there, will leave our camping area, both on this trip and future trips, <br/>

it exposed.<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, we don't want them messing with the box once they're stamped in, <br/>
and we certainly don't want to tempt them to leave the Scout camping area on <br/>

They're all 10 or 11.  I know most of them from previous years, but there are <br/>
a few new ones, too.  They're mostly good kids who follow the rules, but who <br/>
knows if it might seem "cool" to head off on their own.  :::sigh:::<br/>
<br/>
My husband suggested hiding our own box just for the occasion, and making it <br/>
clear to the boys that it won't be there anymore after we find it.  Maybe <br/>
that's the answer.<br/>

Then, you can always hide it in another location after the event for <br/>

the importance of not being reckless about hiding places. They usually <br/>

it to be too easy for the next person. However, they will sometimes get <br/>
impatient too quickly if they are boxing with someone who hasn't found a box yet. <br/>
They will want to show them where it is without letting them find it on their <br/>
own. I just remind them how great it feels to find it on your own, and tell them <br/>
to come away from the area and let the other person find it themselves.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Idea! How about tasking each scout with not only carving a small <br/>
stamp about a particular theme but with actually creating a clue and <br/>
a box, too?  The boxes don't have to be big--several of mine are <br/>
merely 35 mm film canisters which aren't expensive if you pick up a <br/>
bag of empty ones at your local film developer--I'm sure they'd be <br/>
happy to get rid of them.  Then cut printer paper into thin long <br/>
strips--about 1-1/2" in width.  Stack several of these strips on top <br/>
of eachother, fold in the middle, staple three times along the <br/>
fold/crease at the top--and you've got your logbook.  Cut your <br/>
carving medium into 1"x1/2" pieces and let them carve away. You've <br/>
got an inexpensive letterbox and a great tool for teaching so many <br/>
incredible things to the scouts.  Have the scouts come up with their <br/>
own trail names.<br/>
<br/>
Ideas for clues:<br/>
using a compass for directions<br/>
pace count<br/>
research local history<br/>
or stick to a theme for the entire troop<br/>
<br/>
Then, during the campout they're tasked with actually finding a <br/>
hiding spot and drafting clues that would lead others to the box.  <br/>
Instant craft, history, orienteering, problem solving, hiking, <br/>
writing skill craft badge! ;)  Oh, if the kids get really excited, <br/>
it may wear off on their parents and then you may have a whole new <br/>
letterboxing community in your midst!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Hope you have a great meeting tomorrow evening!<br/>

And you're darned good at it, too!  I'll have to think about this one.  Maybe <br/>
if they seem to like letterboxing, we can do it at the next campout.  We go <br/>
once a month, so there's ALWAYS a "next" one, it seems!<br/>

 HI<br/>
I'm a scoutmaster in RI and I've found that scouts love the search. Letterboxing helps them understand the use of a compass like I've never could get across by anyother method. Although most of the boxes we have visited have been far from home,the scouts have treated the boxes with respect. <br/>
<br/>
At your campout try planting some of your own letterboxes for the event, maybe have the stamps spell out the Scout Law. After the event Ask the scout families that attend if they would like to adopt a box. Cub Scouting is a family run group and letterboxing fits right in. In the 6 months that I've been letterboxing, 3 families from my troop have started boxing. <br/>
<br/>
Have a Great Campout.<br/>

instead of having them find an established box, placing a  few boxes just<br/>
for the scouts.  Maybe even startign with simple boxes arouund the school<br/>
to teach them the ethics of boxing--discretion, careful rehiding, respectign<br/>
the environment.  I think it wouldl be good to have them place a box or two<br/>
as well, to get that "ownership" high.  My tentative plan is to do thsi in<br/>
an area where there are o boxes yet so as to avoid spoiling others;'.  I<br/>
still havne't decided , so will be interested in what others say.<br/>

   Leaving the campsite for any reason would be a major violation of the<br/>
rules for us--as I am sure it is for you.  Never hurts to emphasize the<br/>
"rules" and consequences!<br/>

Den camping with the pack in a few weeks, and my<br/>
daughter and I are going to go and hide a few boxes in<br/>
the park where they will be, then give clues to our<br/>
den at least, if not the whole pack.  Even my husband,<br/>
the Wolf den leader, won't know where the boxes are! <br/>
We do plan on picking them back up at the end of the<br/>
weekend though.  We considered doing real letterboxing<br/>
with them, but decided we wanted to test the waters<br/>
with them with our own placed boxes, so they don't<br/>
mess up someone else's boxes either inadvertantly or<br/>
deliberately.  Once we have a better feel for the<br/>
boys' affinity to letterboxing, we will probably take<br/>
them venturing out to real boxes.  Of course, our<br/>
little guys are a little too young (7 years old) to<br/>
carve their own stamps!<br/>

If you go to the letterboxing.org site and click on the kids section there is a section for carving stamps for kids. In fact it says, "Want to carve stamps &amp; not say "OW!" ? Carve without sharp tools... We'll show You how!"  It looks pretty easy and I think 7 year olds could handle it with proper adult supervision!<br/>
<br/>
I was planning on doing letterboxing with my Webelos group. But I might try introducing the whole pack at our camping trip next month with specially placed boxes just for them! <br/>

I think we may try boxing and letting them sign in<br/>
first, to see how the hunting goes.  If they have fun,<br/>
we can carve stamps and add the stamping element at<br/>
the next campout.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My daughter and I went out yesterday to plant our<br/>
boxes for this weekend's cub scout campout.  We<br/>
planted five boxes in Mission Tejas State Park, here<br/>
in Texas.  All the boxes are within walking distance<br/>
of our campsite.  I expect it will take them about<br/>
three hours to find them all.  We'll be taking them<br/>
back up at the end of the weekend, although we may<br/>
replant them at a later time with good stamps.<br/>
<br/>
We used a variety of hints - paces, compass direction,<br/>
and visual clues.  For the boxes themselves, we put<br/>
stickers in them, so that each boy will get a sticker<br/>
to put into their book and then we'll let them<br/>
thumbprint in per your suggestion DebBee! We figure<br/>
we'll see how they do with the boxing itself, and if<br/>
they enjoy it, we'll work on carving and getting more<br/>
creative.<br/>
<br/>
Silver Eagle and Baby Bear have two boxes planted in<br/>
the same park.  We had already found them on an<br/>
earlier visit, but we walked right past them as we<br/>
planted our own!  Kind of fun knowing these boys will<br/>
be running past the real thing on their way to the<br/>
ones we planted!  We did try to check on Baby Bear's<br/>
box, but we couldn't remember precisely where it was. <br/>
We checked the area pretty thoroughly and didn't find<br/>
it, so we are going to take the clues for her box back<br/>
with us this weekend to check it.  We'll check Silver<br/>
Eagle's while we are there too.<br/>
<br/>
My 7 year old son went with us too, although he forgot<br/>
to take his shoes - remembered his gameboy but forgot<br/>
his shoes to hike in? - grrrr!  He wound up staying in<br/>
the car and ran the battery down - another grrrr!  We<br/>
got back to the car after the ranger's station closed,<br/>
were parked well out of cell phone range, so I started<br/>
the hike to the station anyway in hopes of finding a<br/>
place where my cell phone would work, or at least<br/>
planning on finding a pay phone at the entrance. <br/>
Fortunately, we ran into the only camper in the park<br/>
and he had cables, so we got a jump.  As it happened,<br/>
the camper was an old friend of my parents'!  What a<br/>
small world!  Good thing we ran into him too - we had<br/>
to drive about 10 miles out of the park before my cell<br/>
phone started working again!  Note to self - check the<br/>
kid for shoes before we walk out the door!<br/>
<br/>
Even in spite of the car trouble, it was a good day<br/>
all in all.  Now to find out how cub scouts fare with<br/>
letterboxing!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Now to find out how cub scouts fare with letterboxing! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do report back on how it goes!  I guess I'll whip up a few boxes for our <br/>
campout.  Since I may very well have 8-9 boys from our den there, it'd be better <br/>
if they're not all going after the same box at the same time anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Our campout is NEXT weekend, so maybe I'll get to hear how yours went before <br/>
we do ours.  (Handy bit of scheduling, there.)<br/>
<br/>
DebBee, who has *NO* problem believing your son remembered his Game Boy but <br/>
not his shoes!!!<br/>
