the Hurricane Katrina Funds that have opened up.  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It seems in times of distress there are those who call out and hear no<br/>
replys...<br/>
<br/>
Voices in the night crying for help and relief from the pain that a natural<br/>
disaster can cause..<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes all it takes is a helping hand to lift our spirits up and help us<br/>
to regain our strength.<br/>
<br/>
In our time of need, you have been there to be that helping hand and words<br/>
of comfort when it looked like our world was destroyed forever.<br/>
<br/>
Someday you may need that same helping hand and I want you to know that ours<br/>
will be here for you.<br/>
<br/>
You may be wondering why I am writing this. thinking " They have said thanks<br/>
enough." or " We only did what anyone would do." but I don't think that I<br/>
can ever be thankful enough for friends such as you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you get a chance please try to watch a program that National Geographic<br/>
produced called "Inside Hurricane Katrina"  I want you to all see what you<br/>
are helping and why your aid has been so important to us.  If you see a<br/>
donation bucket somewhere and can afford the dollar please slip it in.. The<br/>
Gulf Coast will need your help for a long time to come.  If you cant, thank<br/>
you for your previous donations.  They mean a lot to those with nothing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sunday, November 6, 6:00P  is the next showing of Inside Hurricane Katrina<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again from the bottom of my heart,<br/>
<br/>
