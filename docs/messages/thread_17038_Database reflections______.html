<br/>
Seems to me that some are more worried over databases, clues and other things than what I've been shown letterboxing to be by the Moorland Wizard.  A fun hobby the entire family can enjoy.  <br/>
<br/>
Please, everyone, lets just drop these threads and try to remember why we're here... To enjoy this hobby, not to bicker about whether or not the sun rises in the east or the west or how to pronounce potato.<br/>
<br/>
To the people that complain about alternative databases, I've a few questions that I want to ask.... Are you policing every website on the internet to ensure that your boxes are not spoken of in any manner? Are you planning on censoring each and every email that is passed in private that people discuss your letterboxes in?  Are you going to put a gag order on each person that finds your letterboxes to ensure that they don't say anything to anyone?  Are you going to require permission slips be signed in triplicate before anyone can go and search for your boxes?  I, for one, certainly hope not, that ranks right up there of elitism and a very myopic view of the world.<br/>
<br/>
To the people that run the databases other than LBNA and NLC where only the owner can comment or change the status on a letterbox, I've a few questions to ask.... Why? Why do you insist in not complying with the requests of the owners of the letterboxes?  Why, if they don't wish their letterboxes listed anywhere else, in a public venue, do you insist on doing so?  Respect and  Responsibility.   Two words missing from far to many people's vocabulary.  Respect for themselves and for others and their property.  Responsibility, not only to themselves, but to others and to the environment that supports and nurtures us.<br/>
<br/>
Each time I find a letterbox, I am thankful.... I have discovered, through the eyes of another, the beauty of nature, in a place that I would have never seen. I see another's artistic abilities placed on display, for all to see, and far too many people are afraid to even do that anonymously. Yet, here we are, carving our hearts out, searching for just the right spot to hide it, crafting the clues as best we can in the hope that someone will come and seek it out and discover it, waiting to see if they appreciate what we appreciated, if they see what we saw or if we've failed to express ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, here we sit, typing away madly, our words flowing before our better judgment kicks in, saying things, flaming people, attacking them, talking about them behind their back, griping and moaning and crying like a 3 year old who had his lollypop taken by the bully on the schoolyard. And all for what?  So that we can feel better about ourselves, we certainly showed that person!<br/>
<br/>
I for one am saddened by the way that some of the people on these lists have handled themselves.  I took a month long break from posting for one simple reason... Because I let others get to me and compromise my principles. We are who and what we are, for better or worse. No one person is any better or any worse than the other.  Almost everyone has done something to upset or hurt another here, and, perhaps, if we all stepped back and remembered why we're here in the first place, this family oriented hobby could become a family again.  Stranger things have happened!<br/>
