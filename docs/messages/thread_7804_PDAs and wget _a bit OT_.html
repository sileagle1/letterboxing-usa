I don't know PDA's from apple butter, but I know a bit about computers, so<br/>
I have a suggestion for those who have too much time on their hands and<br/>
feel like doing something cool.<br/>
<br/>
I run unix, and in the unix world there is something called 'wget'.  Properly<br/>
configured, it simply sucks websites down to your personal computer.  Pretty<br/>
handy, because with a slow connection I can run it overnight, then view <br/>
the clues over a local network when I want to.  Then, the next night it will<br/>
just download the portions of the websites that have changed.<br/>
<br/>
Having such a utility on a PDA, configured to suck down all the clues,<br/>
would be cool.  I don't know what OSs and tools are available for PDAs,<br/>
but I assume there is an http client, and the thing can run on wall power<br/>
overnight.<br/>
<br/>
Then, you always have all the clues.  I think it would be cool, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion that may be totally lame ... please don't bombard the list <br/>
with mountains of technical discussion in any case :-) (or flag it in the<br/>
subject line).<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
