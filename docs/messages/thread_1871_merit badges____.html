 The merit badges offered will be F (for found), P (for planted), X (for <br/>
exchanged)<br/>
 The denominations will be  10 ,  25,  50,  75,  100,  <br/>
   Before now, I haven't considered above 100.    What would the Web Masters <br/>
like to see offered here?  150, 200, 250, etc  or more of a challenge like <br/>
200, 500, 1000 ? :oP<br/>

 Let me know,  Mohmers<br/>
<br/>
THose wanting to order just send a self addressed stamped envelope to <br/>

<br/>
$4 per merit badge.  Please clearly specify the Letter and Number.<br/>
<br/>
To avoid confusion with the order that Val is sending in, there is no order <br/>
form yet. So it is up to you to write neatly.  :o)  {gufaw}<br/>
This is only for merit badges not the logo patch.<br/>

I don't think its up to the webmasters, but up to the list (or the <br/>
letterboxer that want these things).  The webmasters aren't interested <br/>
in setting policy for the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
I think the question is how many different denominations can be gotten<br/>
in one run?  I don't know how these things work, but if the limit<br/>
is 5 denominations per run, I would throw the 75 and/or the 10 overboard <br/>
and replace it with a 500 and 1000.  The 75 definitely seems useless, <br/>
IMHO :-)<br/>
<br/>
It also depends on how frequently one of these orders can be mustered.<br/>
If it is more than once a year or more, getting 500s at least in the <br/>
pipeline now makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
So, if it were me, I'd do 25, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and sort of make<br/>
that a standard, for now.  But like I said, I really don't understand<br/>
how these things work.  If we can do 10, 25, 50, (75), 100, 500, 1000<br/>
now, fine, but I personally would order a 500 if one were possible.<br/>
<br/>

should be Gold, and then maybe use a silvery thread for the 200? At any<br/>
rate, my basic idea is that maybe there could be a different color thread<br/>
for the text of some chosen number such as 100, 200, or even 500 which i'm<br/>
sure is an attainable number given the number of boxes in the WORLD.<br/>

   Thanks Kay for considering the kids in your denominations. I think <br/>
increments of 25 at the lower end are important. We are trying to <br/>
encourage participation so a little reward is due.  You will be <br/>
getting our order soon. Carol<br/>
