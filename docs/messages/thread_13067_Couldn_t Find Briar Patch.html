I'm new to this list and need some help. Try as I did, I couldn't find the<br/>
first box and altho I'm very positive I had the clues correctly, when I<br/>
approached the hiding area-gone was the box. Could I have miscalculated. Has<br/>
anyone seen the Briar Patch boxes. I was out there on 5/18/03 and couldn't<br/>
find. Advice? Can the person that placed the box check on it?<br/>
Thanks<br/>
