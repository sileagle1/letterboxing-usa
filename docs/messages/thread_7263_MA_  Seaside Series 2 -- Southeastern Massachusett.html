We have been placing them over the last several weeks as we traveled <br/>
about the area.  Enjoy, and please let us know about any problems.  <br/>

SEASIDE LETTERBOXES<br/>
This is a continuation of the series of letterboxes in Southeastern <br/>
Massachusetts.  Series Two includes boxes in the towns of Marion, <br/>
Fairhaven, and Gosnold (on Cuttyhunk Island).  The numbers of the <br/>
boxes are sequential after the numbers of the Series One boxes.  <br/>
These boxes were placed during the month of August by The Yachtman <br/>
and The Catnapper (aka Mary Manatee).<br/>
<br/>
SEASIDE LETTERBOXES -- SERIES TWO<br/>
<br/>
5. Old Landing <br/>
<br/>
This letterbox can be found in the town of Marion.  From Route 195 <br/>
East or West, take exit 20, and go south on Front St.  Cross Route 6 <br/>
at the traffic light, and pass Plymouth Savings Bank on your right.  <br/>
Immediately after passing Burr Brothers Boat Yard, Old Landing is the <br/>
boat launching area on your left across from the Marion Sport Shop.  <br/>
If you do not have a Marion/Rochester sticker, you will have to park <br/>
either in Burr Brothers lot, at the Sport Shop, or in the lot on the <br/>
corner of Route 6 by Cumberland Farms.  The box is placed in the <br/>
Northwest corner of this well-kept lot, that contains memorials to <br/>
several groups of Veterans of foreign wars.  When you reach the NW <br/>
corner, look into the trunk of the ample old tree, and you will find <br/>
your reward.  Please be careful that nobody sees you removing your <br/>
prize, as this area can be quite busy.<br/>
<br/>
6.  Ft Phoenix<br/>
<br/>
At the foot of the harbor in the town of Fairhaven, is a historic <br/>
fort that dates from the Revolutionary War period.  Some twenty-five <br/>
days after the "shots heard round the world" at Lexington and <br/>
Concord, a naval battle was fought at  Ft Phoenix.  British soldiers <br/>
captured and burned the fort; later local militia turned them out of <br/>
the town of Fairhaven.  Fort Phoenix was rebuilt during the Civil War <br/>
to repel a Confederate attach that never came.  In the latter part of <br/>
the 1800's, it became a recreational area with bath houses and <br/>
pavilions; at the same time, the for fell into disrepair.  <br/>
Massachusetts acquired the site for a state park in 1960.  A local <br/>
man, Donald Bernard, was instrumental in restoration of the fort, and <br/>
the documentation of its history.  <br/>
To reach the fort, take Route 6 (West or East) to Main St (a traffic <br/>
light), which is across from the Fairhaven High School.  Go south to <br/>
the intersection of Ferry and Main Streets.  Jog right to Fort St, <br/>
and continue to the end to Fort Phoenix.  Park in the parking lots <br/>
inside the gates if they are open, or outside on the street if they <br/>
are not.  Please be aware that the town seriously means not to "angle <br/>
park" along the street outside (this includes no head in parking --- <br/>
parallel park only).  This may seem silly, since you will undoubtedly <br/>
see cars parked head in there.  If a traffic policeman comes along, <br/>
however, you will receive a ticket for illegal parking.<br/>
Explore the fort and/or the hurricane barrier that extends out into <br/>
the harbor shared with New Bedford.  Then proceed south towards the <br/>
water.  Walk  west on a path along the water until you reach the end <br/>
of the wall.  Keep walking (towards the beach area) until you see a <br/>
very large flat boulder.  Sit on this boulder.  From here, Butler <br/>
Flats Lighthouse bears190 degrees, and a flagpole at the fort bears <br/>
280 degrees, and a prominent smokestack across the harbor in New <br/>
Bedford bears 236 degrees.  Reach down under the end of the large <br/>
boulder, and find your reward.  Please be careful at this site, as it <br/>
is very heavily visited in the good weather.  <br/>
<br/>
7. The Slugger<br/>
<br/>
This box was placed  to honor the late Ted Williams, who died in the <br/>
middle of the summer of 2002.  It can be reached by car, or by <br/>
bicycle along the Phoenix Bike Trail.  If you have just found the Ft <br/>
Phoenix box, and wish to travel by bike, proceed several blocks north <br/>
to the intersection of Main and Ferry Streets, and park in the lot <br/>
adjacent to Margaret's Restaurant (a good place for breakfast).  The <br/>
bike trail proceeds east from here along the site of the old <br/>
Fairhaven Branch Railroad.  For more information on the history of <br/>
the railroad, and on the bike path itself, visit one of the <br/>
following  internet sites:  <br/>
www.millicentlibrary.org/biketrail/bikmap1.jpg; <br/>
www.nbwclub.org/announcements/Matta_bikepath/phoenix_trail.html.  The <br/>
Slugger letterbox is found near the eastern end of the bike path, 3.2 <br/>
miles from the start near Margaret's Restaurant.  If driving from Ft <br/>
Phoenix, take Route 6 East until you have almost reached the <br/>
Mattapoisett line.  Turn right on Shaw Road, and proceed south, <br/>
passing the town Little League fields on your right.  After crossing <br/>
the bike path, there is a small dirt pull-off on your left.  You can <br/>
park here.  From Shaw Road, The Slugger letterbox is found by <br/>
proceeding west from Shaw Road.  After passing the dirt path leading <br/>
to the baseball fields, proceed 72 paces to a "jumble of rocks" on <br/>
your right.  Your treasure can be found on the back side of the rock <br/>
pile, in front of several oak trees.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Note:  One or several more boxes are planned for places along the <br/>
Phoenix Bike Trail  stay tuned)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
8. &amp; 9. Cuttyhunk Island (Two Boxes)<br/>
<br/>
The Island of Cuttyhunk is the southernmost (and westernmost) of the <br/>
Elizabeth Islands.  It can be reached by power or sailboat if you <br/>
have one.  If not, you can ride the ferry, the Alert II from New <br/>
Bedford any day during the summer months, and on a more erratic <br/>
schedule during the other months of the year.  If you are really <br/>
adventurous, you can fly in on the small seaplane operated by Bayside <br/>
Air.  Cuttyhunk was first discovered by Bartholomew Gosnold in 1602, <br/>
and is a haven for boaters, fishermen and those who like the quiet <br/>
life.  There are very few gas-powered vehicles on the island, and <br/>
most folks get about in electric golf carts.  During the summer <br/>
months, the Island's inhabitants swell with a flood of visitors, <br/>
including hundreds of boaters who moor or anchor their boats in the <br/>
tranquil waters of Cuttyhunk Pond, or in the outside harbor.  <br/>
Cuttyhunk has one tall hill, from which you can see all from the Cape <br/>
Cod Canal in the North, to Gay Head in the East, to Newport, Rhode <br/>
Island in the West on a clear day.  One of the favorite pastimes of <br/>
visitors is to flock to the wooden platform at the top of the hill to <br/>
see a spectacular sunset over the waters of Rhode Island Sound.<br/>
<br/>
8. CH 400<br/>
<br/>
After arriving in Cuttyhunk, proceed to the town wharf.  If you are <br/>
on your own boat, this is adjacent to the dinghy dock; if you come in <br/>
on the Alert II, you will have to walk a ways along the only road <br/>
into town.  From the dock, head up the road that goes uphill.  About <br/>
halfway up, look for a road to your right that goes past the <br/>
Cuttyhunk Historical Society, the town library, and the elementary <br/>
school.  Climb the hill to the top, and see the spectacular views <br/>
from the wooden platform with the flag waving.  From the base of the <br/>
stairs, site the Gosnold Monument at 250 degrees.  Take the dirt path <br/>
at 270 degrees (the first path on your right when climbing down the <br/>
stairs).  Go left at the first fork, then right at the next fork.  <br/>
Climb a hill, and pass through an open gate.  Bear right towards a <br/>
concrete bunker.  At the southeast corner of the bunker, the Gosnold <br/>
monument bears 256 degrees, and Gay Head Light bears 154 degrees.  CH <br/>
400 lies under a pile of rocks at this corner of the bunker.<br/>
<br/>
9. Church's Beach<br/>
<br/>
Return to the town dock area, and facing uphill, take the road which <br/>
is the farthest to the right.  Proceed to the end, passing the yacht <br/>
club on the way.  Enter the beach by the rockey path at its end.  <br/>
Turn right and walk along the flat boulders on a heading of 150 <br/>
degrees for 12 paces.  You will have reached a large, flat boulder <br/>
with a pointed end.  From this rock, a building on Penikese is <br/>
visible at 360 degrees, the flagpole at the yacht club is at 156 <br/>
degrees, and the old Coast Guard Station building is at 115 degrees.  <br/>
The Church's Beach Letterbox is under your feet.<br/>
