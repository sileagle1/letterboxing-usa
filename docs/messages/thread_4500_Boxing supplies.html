                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have been using Aero Houseware's 2.5 cup food storage containers, as they <br/>
are way cheaper than Rubbermaid (2 for $1), made in America (MA), and have <br/>
pretty tight-fitting lids.  The Dollar Tree sells them.<br/>
<br/>
Until yesterday, though, I could not find pens that would fit inside.  I <br/>
found that Bic makes a new pen, sold in packs of 4 ($1.39 at Office Max), <br/>
called Cristal Pocket.  They look just like regular Bics, but are only about <br/>
4" long.<br/>

Thanks Lucy for that info!  I will have to look for those.  I like to <br/>
leave a pen in my boxes for any non-letterboxers who stumble across <br/>
them...then they can leave a message.<br/>

A while ago there was a discussion on stamp making supplies and what<br/>
different people use. About three weeks ago I was at Art Media in<br/>
Beaverton Oregon and picked up a small wood-bloc carving kit. It comes<br/>
with five knives of different shapes and sizes and has worked<br/>
beautifully on all of the stamps I have used it on.<br/>
The set cost me about $6, a major improvement over a speedball carver<br/>
and you don't have to buy all of the separate tips. An added bonus for<br/>
me at least is that you don't have to fumble around with tips when you<br/>
want something different to carve with.<br/>
<br/>
It comes in a green box with the word NIGI written on it.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought some of the carvers out there would like to know<br/>
