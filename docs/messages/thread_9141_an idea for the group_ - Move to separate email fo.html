I manage all those emails by creating a separate folder under my <br/>
InBox called LBNA and a rule that automatically moves all subjects <br/>
containing "LBNA" into it.  My regular email is free of LBNA stuff <br/>
all mixed up in it.  My LBNA stuff is all together in one place.  <br/>
Then it is easy to go through and delete most posts from other <br/>
states and subjects that don't look interesting.<br/>

&gt; Lately, due to my limited internet availability and<br/>
&gt; the number of posts, I have shifted back and forth<br/>
&gt; using digest mode. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What would save alot of time is for folks to try to be<br/>
&gt; much more clear in the subject line. For example, a<br/>
&gt; comment about "A Good Day Boxing" would be easier to<br/>
&gt; read or pass on if it began with the state<br/>
&gt; abbreviation. The region would be nice as well, but<br/>
&gt; the state, IMHO, should always be included.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If the thread gets away from the initial subject, to<br/>
&gt; something off topic or of general interest, then<br/>
&gt; change the subject to reflect that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know the webmasters ask us to ID the state for a new<br/>
&gt; box due to their own time crunch. I think many of us<br/>
&gt; who love to read posts for our specific areas are also<br/>
&gt; in the same position and so a state ID would help<br/>
&gt; greatly. Just my 2 cents.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Howdy group.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; With more and more boxers each week, (hurrah!) when<br/>
&gt; &gt; I sit down to check my <br/>
&gt; &gt; e-mail, I'm overwhelmed by the number of posts.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; wondered if there could be <br/>
&gt; &gt; a way to split the list between letterboxing clues<br/>
&gt; &gt; -vs- socializing posts?  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Both important to those involved, but honestly 7 or<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8 posts a day from two or <br/>
&gt; &gt; three people add up add that to the clues and I too<br/>
&gt; &gt; find myself deleting <br/>
&gt; &gt; without being able to read every post...I'm sure I'm<br/>
&gt; &gt; missing good schtuff.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just wondered how the group as a whole feels about<br/>
&gt; &gt; two different lists...or <br/>
&gt; &gt; something in the memo line that defines what's to<br/>
&gt; &gt; follow....or my least <br/>
&gt; &gt; favorite idea, ...taking the multiple posts off list<br/>
&gt; &gt; unless they are clue <br/>
&gt; &gt; related.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Any thoughts from others lurking?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance!<br/>
