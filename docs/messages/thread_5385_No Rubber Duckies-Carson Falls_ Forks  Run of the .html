<div>Hike: About a mile of easy going along the 
river.  Check yourself and dogs for 
ticks.  Once the box is found one can continue up river for several more miles.  This hike is one of the 
most accessible yet pristine rivers walks in the lower Sierras.  
Activities:  river rafting experts only, fishing and camping.  No 
swimming here, the rapids make it too dangerous!.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Directions:  From the home of the Troll drive 
east to Sierra Highway and turn north.  Pass by the Kernville chicken at 
1/10 of a mile and drive  19.4 miles to Johnsondale Bridge.  Park in 
the lot and walk back across the old bridge.  Walk down the steps to trail 
33E23-5.  Take this trail up river.  About 6 or 7 minutes beyond the 
point where you last see the bridge you will come across little paths going down 
to the river.  Continue on the main trail approximately 150 paces beyond 
the first river path.  You will see a huge cement gray colored boulder just 
to the left of the trail.  This boulder is directly east of the drop at 
Carson Falls. Look for the letterbox behind some movable rocks under the area 
where the large boulder meets a smaller round one next to the 
trail.</div>
<div>Carson Falls is the last large rapid on "The Forks" 
of the Upper Kern River.  The Forks has some of the toughest whitewater in 
California.  Carson Falls is feared and respected by all boatmen.  It 
tends to make knees weak and makes it difficult to even swallow a gulp of 
water.  Most boatmen are a lot happier on the down river side of the 
rapid.  Even the most avid letterboxer who is boating The Forks will 
probably not stop and stamp in as his mind is on the river.  For those 
hiking up to this letterbox be sure to see if anyone is rafting or 
kayaking.  Normally boaters reach this spot in the afternoon during the 
spring-early summer runs.  If commercial companies are boating there will 
be photographers catching the action at Carson Falls so try and catch it 
yourself.  Enjoy!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Caution:  The Kern River in this area is too 
dangerous for wading and swimming, The letterbox title, "No Rubber Duckies" refers to the cheap rafts that some people of 
diminished intelligence try and use on the river and thus become 
statistics.</div>
