I am saddened by this news.  I enjoyed his letterboxes, which are <br/>
nearby.<br/>
<br/>
At the 1st VA Icebreaker letterboxing gather, in 2004, Towncrier was <br/>
the first guest to arrive.  I was very nervous hosting the event.  <br/>
As he sat and talked with me he calmed me down.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember he had a really cool personal stamp, an astronomical <br/>
armillary sphere.  I will have fond memories of him when I come upon <br/>
his stamp again in another letterbox log.<br/>

&gt; Dear letterboxing friends,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am saddened to announce the death of Towncrier74 of northern <br/>
Virginia  this past Monday.  His daughter Joy has decided to honor <br/>
her father by maintaining  his three boxes.<br/>
&gt; Considering that she and her siblings have many obligations at <br/>
this time, I am asking you to be particularly helpful when visiting <br/>
these boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Condolence messages may be posted to the talk list and when Joy <br/>
has more time, she will happily read them, do not expect a response <br/>
immediately.  I am confident that the letterboxing community will <br/>
respond with kindness and perhaps an anecdote or two.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Regards,<br/>
&gt; Susan<br/>
