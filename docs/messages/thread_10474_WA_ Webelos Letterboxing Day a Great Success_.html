                    <div class="plaintext-content">Saturday, Jan. 25 the Webelos Cub Scouts of Pack 211 in <br/>
Olympia Wa had an outing to Kennedy Creek Salmon Trail just <br/>
west of Olympia.  <br/>
<br/>
The event was planned as a routine outing for the boys to <br/>
achieve one of their basic requirements of a cub scout hike.  I, <br/>
Nailhead, father of one of the 3 Webelos, posted a request to the <br/>
local Letterboxing community to place a few boxes at the site so <br/>
that the boys might enjoy the hike further. I recieved an <br/>
overwhelming and enthusiastic response from area boxers and <br/>
within 2 weeks of the request there were many boxes placed in <br/>
the trail system.  <br/>
<br/>
The 3 boys were supplied with clues, log books, and ink pads, <br/>
they fashioned their own custom sig stamps a week prior and <br/>
were accompanied by the fathers of the boys. The boys had a <br/>
great time despite a constant rain at the trail site.  <br/>
<br/>
The boys were successful in finding  7 out of 8 boxes planted in <br/>
the area and also recieved a special surprise.  Patricius <br/>
Delavarius, an East Coast Letterboxer,  had contacted me off list <br/>
asking if he could come and meet the boys and bring a surprise.  <br/>
I agreed and he met the boys on the trail as they were logging <br/>
into their first find.<br/>
<br/>
Pat tagged along with the boys and gave pointers as well as <br/>
chatted with the other dads about letterboxing on both sides of <br/>
the continent.  At the end of the day, Pat announced that he <br/>
himself had planted a special box for the occasion and gave the <br/>
boys verbal clues to follow.  The boys were delighted to find a <br/>
beautifully crafted event stamp commerating the hike as well as <br/>
a gorgeous hand made log book, both handmade by the famous <br/>
Alafair of CT.  <br/>
<br/>
The boys graciously logged into the event letterbox and were told <br/>
by Pat that the box was a gift to their Webelos den from himself <br/>
and Alafair.  The boys are about to bridge up to Boy Scouts and <br/>
have been trying to come up with a gift to bestow on their pack as <br/>
is the tradition for graduating cub scouts.  They have decided to <br/>
replant the box and create clues that incorporate many cub scout <br/>
reqirements and give the letterbox and clues to their pack as a <br/>
legacy to future Webelos!   The clues will be kept off list and <br/>
used by the pack for future outings.  <br/>
<br/>
The boys' leader and the other father were quite impressed with <br/>
such a gift given by folks from clear across the country. They <br/>
were also very grateful for the favors of the local letterboxers in <br/>
placing the boxes for the boys to enjoy.  One of the boy's father <br/>
has already taken his family out on a letterboxing hunt with some <br/>
success and the leader has talked about taking the rest of his <br/>
family out for a hunt also.  <br/>
<br/>
On Sunday, the Nail Family (Webelo Cub Scout- Garrett <br/>
included)  met the local boxers along with visiting benefactor <br/>
Patricius Delevarius for a mini-gathering at Pt. Defiance Park in <br/>
Tacoma, WA.  The Nail Cub Scout had the pleasure of thanking <br/>
the local boxers who placed the letterboxes for the scout outing <br/>
on behalf of Pack 211 and presenting the event letterbox stamp <br/>
and log book to the local boxers to log into.  Local South Puget <br/>
Sound Letterboxers who placed boxes for the event and who <br/>
attended the gathering included: DVN2RCKR (and her little <br/>
ones), Fudrick, Hoopoe, and Trial n Error (Evil Glenn who also <br/>
placed a box for the event did not attend the gathering although <br/>
there was rumor of a mysterious stranger lurking about).  All the <br/>
attendees logged into the event box and exchanged sig stamps <br/>
with Patricius Delavarius who was on a business trip to Olympia.  <br/>
All the boxers had been out earlier in the day and wrapped up the <br/>
day talking and sharing stories about their adventures.  <br/>
<br/>
All the folks had a great time and were sorry that other S.Sound <br/>
invitees could not attend (apparently the Super Bowl was too <br/>
much of a draw to compete with a small letterboxing event)<br/>
<br/>
A final thanks from the Webelos of Pack 211, their parents, and <br/>
the Nail Family to all who contributed to a great outing and a <br/>
great gathering as well.  A special thanks to Patricius Delavarius <br/>
and Alafair for making the event truly special.  The letterbox will <br/>
be a treasure to all the boys of Pack 211 in Olympia, WA.<br/>
