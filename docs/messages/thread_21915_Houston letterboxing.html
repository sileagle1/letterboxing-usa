If you have time coming from or going to the airport, I really <br/>

boxes:  Bamboo to You, mercer monarch, geisha doll, coy box, <br/>
backwards box, tibetan tiger, end of the trail, and tree man.  It's <br/>
not exactly drive-by, but you can spend as much or as little time as <br/>
you like.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; From where you are staying, you could easily make a short drive <br/>
(by <br/>
&gt; Houston standards) to Memorial Park.  There are lots of boxes <br/>
there <br/>
&gt; to keep you occupied, including Team King's excellent Trivial <br/>
&gt; Pursuit series, Koala-ty Time Togeher, Foghorn Leghorn, Lone Star <br/>
&gt; Dilla, Orange You Glad?, Pumpkin Pi, &amp; Rodeo Rest Stop (those last <br/>
&gt; two are drive-bys).  Also near there is another one of ours, Beer <br/>
&gt; Can House, which is a drive-by and gives you a nice flavor of <br/>
&gt; Houston. Finally, Ho Hum is near there, in a beautiful and <br/>
historic <br/>
&gt; spot.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not boxing, but lots of fun:  you will be here Art Car weekend, <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; a parade up Allen Parkway.  It is worth seeing if you have time <br/>
&gt; Saturday morning, you can visit the cars at Allen Parkway &amp; Taft.  <br/>
&gt; My kids adore seeing all the different cars.  For more information <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   I will be flying to Houston this weekend for a wedding and <br/>
&gt; would <br/>
&gt; &gt; like <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   to try to squeeze in a few letterboxes (we fly in the day <br/>
&gt; before <br/>
&gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   wedding and fly home the day after).  I am the mother of the <br/>
2 <br/>
&gt; &gt; flower <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   girls (as well as hubby being a groomsman) so I will have <br/>
&gt; little <br/>
&gt; &gt; free <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   time, as I will need to get them ready.  I looked at both <br/>
LbNa <br/>
&gt; &gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Atlasquest and found a TON of boxes in Houston (my best guess <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   100+).  Any suggestions for some easy, drive-by boxes?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Thx for any suggestion.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
