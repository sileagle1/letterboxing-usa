Methinks the Lady doth protest too much....<br/>
<br/>
I seem to remember a certain genteel Lady doing a little naked letterboxing  <br/>
of her own.  <br/>
<br/>
It was a dark and foggy night.  A covert operation was in  effect.  Don't <br/>
believe a word she says!<br/>
<br/>
Give the Lady a little booze and she'll strip down to her birthday suit  <br/>
faster than you can say "Tupperware"<br/>

Yes, I'll say  it again - I will box and tell!<br/>

Shocking June, just shocking. And dear, dear unfortunate Firefly; her<br/>
Ladyship is not surprised at your misguided attempt to slander her<br/>
impeccable character. You know it was perfectly innocent and modest,<br/>
at least her Ladyship thought it was. You see dear letterboxers; it<br/>
was in fact a covert operation. Her Ladyship was planting a box for<br/>
guests to find but had to slip out late at night to do so. Innocently<br/>
her Ladyship asked Firefly if she might enjoy a moonlight cruise down<br/>
the lake, we slipped away from the guests and embarked on our "Voyage<br/>
of Discovery". Arriving at the pelagic placement site Her Ladyship<br/>
decided to commune with the earth Goddess. Overcome with the beauty of<br/>
the moonlight sparkling on the lake like millions of Swarovski<br/>
crystals on black silk charmeuse, her ladyship, realizing that<br/>
darkness would offer her the necessary concealment to protect her<br/>
modesty from lurid prying eyes, slipped of her stunning evening gown<br/>
and peau de soi sling back pumps and executed a flawless swan dive<br/>
into the welcoming arms of the Lady of the Lake. What her Ladyship<br/>
didn't realize is that the lurid prying eyes were traveling up and<br/>
down her curvaceous figure like a search light all the time. It seems<br/>
that Firefly was stirred by more than just the beauty and fecund<br/>
promise of the warm sparkling water. Emerging from the water, her<br/>
Ladyships milky white flesh twinkled with droplets of water glinting<br/>
in the moonlight. Handing her Ladyship a towel, Firefly made a<br/>
presumptuous and unanticipated inappropriate advance. Her Ladyship<br/>
found herself, standing there in the sultry evening moonlight a<br/>
Sapphic siren and Firefly the fabled sailor wrecked on the rocks of<br/>
unrequited passion. It is no wonder that her wounded heart has caused<br/>
her to lash out at her Ladyship's unassailable character. Be gentle<br/>
with her she can't help her lot and her misplaced lust is not beyond<br/>
comprehension. I'm sure she'll find someone who will return her<br/>
passions. Rest assured however that her Ladyship's foray into naked<br/>
letterboxing was completely innocent and modest.<br/>

your meds again?<br/>
<br/>
It's amazing how much a few martinis and a few prescription drugs can  cloud <br/>
one's memories isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
You say "innocently invited..."  I say "kidnapped"<br/>
You say "Voyage of Discovery"  I say "Scary Boat Ride From Hell"<br/>
You say "stunning evening gown and peau de soi sling back pumps"  I  say <br/>
"sweat pants and bunny slippers"<br/>
You say "swan dive" I say "inebriated belly flop"<br/>
<br/>
But darling Lady P, it's all semantics, isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
As for what you call my "unanticipated inappropriate advance, " I suppose I  <br/>
should apologize for touching you there, but in the process of hauling  your <br/>
drunken um... person... back on board the boat, I really just grabbed what  <br/>
ever I could.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is safe to say that your foray into naked letterboxing was far  <br/>
from innocent and modest simply because nothing you ever do is innocent or  <br/>
modest.<br/>

With affection,<br/>
Firefly<br/>
