I used to do that too -- in fact, I got a bunch of erasers there that <br/>
looked kinda like Pink Pearls except they were green.<br/>
<br/>
Now I know better, though.  For the price they are *not* worth <br/>
picking up.  In fact, when I pulled one of the stamps made from one <br/>
of those erasers it had pieces falling off of it.  Gritty to carve, <br/>
too small, not durable -- in general, not worth buying.  Much better <br/>
to buy PZ Kut from Stampeaz.com.<br/>
<br/>
These Dollar Tree things look better, though.  More than twice the <br/>
size of those little erasers and made of what looks like vinyl.  <br/>
Hopefully they'll prove to be good to carve and durable.<br/>

Thanks to Funhog's advice, I went to my local Dollar Tree store today and grabbed myself 5 packs of those great "erasers" to use for carving material. A few years ago, I found the same sort of thing there, great for carving but they were too small to do anything really fancy so I was dubious at first when I heard about these.<br/>
<br/>
Not to worry: these are a very good size for many fine carving ideas. Thanks, Funhog!<br/>

That's *probably* better.  The type of rubber used in erasers varies <br/>
greatly, but most of the white ones seem pretty good.  White may be a <br/>
sign that the eraser is made of vinyl rather than regular rubber, I <br/>
dunno, but they generally seem to be good stuff.  Most pink erasers <br/>
are lousy IMHO, and the green things I used to buy at Big Lots were <br/>
even worse.  Brown is no good either, usually crumbly.<br/>
<br/>
I once found a whole pile of erasers in geocaches -- one or two per <br/>
geocache, I eventually amassed quite a few -- that were very good.  <br/>
They came in several different colors including orange, red, and dark <br/>
blue.  They cut just great -- but the dark blue proved to be <br/>
unworkable because you couldn't see an image on it.  I vastly <br/>
preferred the orange when I could find them.  Still, they were still <br/>
too small for anything but tiny stamps, about 3/4" x 1-1/2".<br/>

<br/>
Actually, there are some intangibles there that make the comparison <br/>
even worse.  Consider, for example, whether it'd be preferable to get <br/>
that PZ Kut as a single 10 x 4.75 piece or pre-cut into four 5 x <br/>
2.375 pieces.  You'd rather get it as the single 10 x 4.75 piece not <br/>
only because you can carve bigger stamps but because there is less <br/>
waste when carving smaller stamps.  When you start with a bunch of <br/>
smaller pieces, you're constantly throwing away little scraps that <br/>
are too small to make a stamp from.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Don't mean this to sound cheecky by why do we spend<br/>
&gt; so much time(and gas) looking for cheap carving material and making<br/>
&gt; due with inferior products? <br/>
<br/>
The gas is another factor that more people should take into account.  <br/>
By the time you add up all the costs of driving -- gas, tire wear, <br/>
oil changes and other maintenance, insurance, depreciation on the car <br/>
itself, you'll usually find you're spending perhaps 25 cents per mile <br/>
or more.  It doesn't take too many miles before that cheap eraser <br/>
starts to look pretty expensive indeed.<br/>
<br/>
Even so, the package of three 1.5 x 3 erasers for $1 at Dollar Tree <br/>
comes out OK.  If you laid three packages of erasers out together you <br/>
can add up 9 x 4.5 -- just a bit smaller than a piece of PZ Kut.  <br/>
You've spent $3.  A fourth package would clearly provide more surface <br/>
area than a piece of PZ Kut for $4, perhaps even enough extra to make <br/>
up for how much scrap you're throwing away.  And if you're driving <br/>
past the Dollar Tree anyway, it's not costing you much to stop in.<br/>
<br/>
That leaves the question of how good the erasers are.  Having tried <br/>
them, I find them to be very good -- but being a razor knife carver, <br/>
I still prefer orange PZ Kut and probably won't buy any more erasers. <br/>
 However, those who don't like PZ Kut, those who prefer MasterCarve, <br/>
will probably like these erasers a lot.<br/>

Ye gads, is that eraser really thick enough to make six slices?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  So,<br/>
&gt; in kaneone12590's example, the eraser is cheaper.  If no slicing<br/>
&gt; occurs of said eraser, the PZCut is far cheaper.<br/>
<br/>
I think I'm going to keep my eye out for one of those food slicers <br/>
being sold as surplus or something.  They're waaay too expensive to <br/>
buy a new one just for cutting up rubber, but if I can pick one up <br/>
cheap...<br/>
<br/>
Do you think the deli at Publix would balk if I handed them an eraser <br/>
and asked them to slice it into 1/4" thick pieces for me?<br/>
<br/>
Many years ago, somebody passed a law saying that all the kitchen <br/>
equipment used in restaurants and other public food preparation <br/>
establishments had to be all stainless steel.  A whole pile of <br/>
industrial-quality white porcelain slicers promptly got pitched.  I <br/>
wish I had picked one up.<br/>

PZ Cut for me too.  By the time you spend the money for feul to drive <br/>
all over creation to find these erasers, you are better off just <br/>
ordering a butt load of PZ Cut online and having it sent to you.<br/>

Oh, and small stamps for me, so I get lots out of that big sheet.  And <br/>

<br/>
Are you talking about the orange or the white?  I'm gonna guess the <br/>
orange, since I haven't heard anyone complain about the way the white <br/>
inks up.<br/>
<br/>
I've personally never had a problem with the orange inking up.  But I <br/>
don't use markers, maybe that's it.  Or the fact that I do the <br/>
"acetone scrub" on *every* stamp before carving, whether it needs it <br/>
or not -- which seems to put a very good texture to the surface for <br/>
inking.  As received, sometimes the orange has a surface that's so <br/>
shiny and waxy-looking that I can imagine problems with inking.<br/>
<br/>
I dunno why anyone who likes Speedy-Stamp wouldn't like the white PZ <br/>
Kut.  They're very similar, I think, except that the PZ Kut is white <br/>
instead of pink and costs half as much.<br/>
<br/>
The white erasers at Dollar Tree are just the ticket for people who <br/>
prefer MasterCarve.  I think those who try them will find they are <br/>
very similar to MasterCarve in carving, they're a somewhat more <br/>
reasonable thickness (although still thicker than necessary for <br/>
rubber stamps), and I think they may actually be *more* resistant to <br/>
physical damage and "pilling".  The only downside there is the size <br/>
limitation, but for many people 1-1/2" x 3" is big enough.<br/>

was because I started out on Mastercarve and moved onto Speedy Stamp<br/>
in the interest of making thinner stamps.  I find PZ Kut far too hard<br/>
to carve out small pieces accurately.  I have to push too hard with my<br/>
gouge and all accuracy is gone.  The white seems to be harder to carve<br/>
than the orange and is farther away in consistency with the pink stuff.<br/>
<br/>
With Mastercarve and Speedy Stamp, I can use the vertex of the V to<br/>
pull out a tiny crevice, but this does not work on PZ.<br/>
<br/>
Again, keep in mind that I started with Mastercarve.  PZ Kut is the<br/>
other extreme from that.<br/>

<br/>
I think that is what it really comes down to.<br/>
<br/>
I carve with just exacto blades, and I prefer the PZ Cut because it is <br/>
harder and does not move around.  I can see why someone using a gouge <br/>
might like Mastercarve because it is softer and easier to make a cut.  <br/>
All work well, and I too have seen fantastic stamps done on both as well <br/>
as the pink stuff.  Folks just need to try different things and see what <br/>
works for them.<br/>

me about something he found at a surplus store.  It is a flat, <br/>
smooth, thin, (1/4 in) flexible material used to seal gaskets or pipe <br/>
fittings in plumbing or something like that.  It is dark reddish-<br/>
brown and it is a teeny bit stiffer to cut into than PZcut, but it is <br/>
still quite carvable and gives a seriously sharp edge on your image.  <br/>
The surface is a bit slick, which I like, because excess ink isn't <br/>

I am new to carving and had been mainly using erasers but my dad told <br/>
me about something he found at a surplus store. It is a flat, <br/>
smooth, thin, (1/4 in) flexible material used to seal gaskets or pipe <br/>
fittings in plumbing or something like that. It is dark reddish-<br/>
brown and it is a teeny bit stiffer to cut into than PZcut, but it is <br/>
still quite carvable and gives a seriously sharp edge on your image. <br/>
The surface is a bit slick, which I like, because excess ink isn't <br/>
absorbed into the stamp, leaving a weird composite color of every <br/>
previous ink color. (I hate it when I try to use a light-colored ink <br/>
and the stamped image turns out looking muddy because of all the dark <br/>
ink soaked into the stamp.) I'll be stopping by my local plumbing <br/>
store to see what it runs. My dad paid $1 for a 6 x 8 in slab at the <br/>
surplus store.<br/>
