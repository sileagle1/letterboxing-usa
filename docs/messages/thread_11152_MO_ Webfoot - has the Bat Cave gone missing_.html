Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I'm Webfoot.  Last I knew, the Bat Cave letterbox was in place and safe,<br/>
but I'll go out and check for it and let you know if it's gone missing.<br/>
It was the first box I ever placed.  I'll be very sorry if it has<br/>
disappeared!!  Anyway, I'll let you and the list know what I discover.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry you didn't find it.<br/>
<br/>
Webfoot<br/>
