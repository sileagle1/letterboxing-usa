                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've added a new feature to my Bike it or Hike it web page-MAPS! On <br/>
almost all of my letterboxes (still working on a few) you can now <br/>
click on a map of the bike/hike trail and print out a copy. If you <br/>
live near Uconn, in Storrs, CT, just go to the campus library and <br/>
copy services (first floor) and they can scan a map or picture for <br/>
you for only 50 cents. Just bring a floopy to download it too. FYI, <br/>
the Windsor Locks Canal trail in CT is now open for the summer. They <br/>
close from November 14-April 1 of each year. Also of interest, there <br/>
is a brand new bridge over the Farmington River in Farmington,CT on <br/>
the FVG Trail. Built over the old railroad trestle along the rail <br/>
trail. Looks as though they are getting ready to pave along this <br/>
section. See the FVG South Letterbox for directions. Visit www <br/>
geocities.com/haalck@snet net for the Bike it or Hike it web page.<br/>
