http://www.justdeals.com/ is having a special on five different sizes of these containers for $9.77, which includes shipping. As I type this, the deal lasts for only another 9 hours. This seems like a very good price, to me, even though the smallest might "only" be useful for food storage :-o<br/>

Hope everyone is having a good Easter/Passover weekend!<br/>
