<br/>
I saw your Bottecchia LB come out the other day &amp; thought it was a cool<br/>
idea. Next time I'm over in that area (I still need to figure out your<br/>
blasted Indian Peace Medal clues b/c that is now my nemesis--been there<br/>
twice with no flashes of insight) I thought I'd check it out. Without yet<br/>
being there, and seeing the constellation of bikes, I did wonder whether I'd<br/>
end up snooping around in other bikers' pouches. I'd worry more about that<br/>
possibility than about the bike not being there--this latter part is what<br/>
makes it such a cool idea!<br/>

   The idea about the bike/box came about because one<br/>
of my clue for a letterbox at the same station is<br/>
located under the seat of an abadoned bike there. Then<br/>
leaving notes on Bottecchia as a way of saying "HI." I<br/>
then got a pouch for Bottecchia as a way of hiding a<br/>
Hitchhiker there. Finally turning the pouch into a<br/>
full letterbox. If you commute by bicycle think of a<br/>
safe place for leaving the bike/box. Just give a good<br/>
description of the bike; color, mens/womens,<br/>
racer/mountain/kids and speeds. Maybe a pouch with the<br/>
LBer's patch on it. How about a kid's bike with a<br/>
pouch and have the child make the stamp. Maybe the<br/>
child would ride it and look for other's pouches that<br/>
have the patch on it. Might be a great way to get them<br/>
to ride on the bike paths without them thinking it is<br/>
exercise.       <br/>
   Bottecchia is a old bike from the 60's that I got<br/>
for free and fixed up to ride. I have other bike that<br/>
I ride also. "Centurion" will only be left at my work<br/>
on Saturday between certain times weather permitted or<br/>
after a certain time at another MBTA Station.<br/>
   The train station is RT 128 Amtrak/MBTA station in<br/>
Westwood, Massachussetts.<br/>
   I have 8 letterboxes here in Mass. located around<br/>
Railroad stations. Some of them you have to find the<br/>
right parking spot at the station. Just ask anyone<br/>
trying to do some of the math. Sometimes the person<br/>
goes back to the station 3 times before finding it.<br/>
   Now they have to hit the box in the 4th dimension,<br/>
"TIME".  <br/>
<br/>
Just a little brain storming there.<br/>
