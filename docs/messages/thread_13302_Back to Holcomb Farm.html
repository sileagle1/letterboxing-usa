<br/>
Made time today to go back to Holcomb Farm and get the<br/>
boxes that have been placed there since we last<br/>
visited.<br/>
<br/>
What a Face: Wonderful series. The boys loved doing<br/>
this one. <br/>
<br/>
The Tree Box: All the rain the last week has made this<br/>
area very buggy. Consider yourself warned. <br/>
<br/>
X Marks the Spot: See above note. This box was half<br/>
full of water. The logbook was damp, the stamp was<br/>
broken, and the bag was torn. This one needs some<br/>
serious love. <br/>
