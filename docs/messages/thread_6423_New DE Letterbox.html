The box was in good condition.  There was a lot of frisbee golf <br/>
trafic. We had to wait for the golfers to move on before re-hiding <br/>
the box. <br/>

Thanks for a fun letterbox hunt. It was nice to have a new letterbox <br/>
in DE!!!!    <br/>

&gt; A 30-45 minute easy hike located in the northern Delaware <br/>
countryside <br/>
&gt; in scenic Brandywine Creek State Park.<br/>
&gt; Getting there: From I-95 South, Take exit 8 (Rt.202 North). Turn <br/>
left <br/>
&gt; onto Rockland Road. Pass by the Rockland, DE Post Office. Follow <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; road left-becomes Adams Dam road. Across the bridge and up the hill <br/>
&gt; you will find the park entrance. Start your hike at the park <br/>
office. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Clues<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the park office follow the multi-colored trail through the old <br/>
&gt; growth forest. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Soon the blue trail will break off and pass through a stone wall. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Follow the tree line until passing through a perpendicular line of <br/>
&gt; trees. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Through the trees and to the right you will see a set of restrooms. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Near the restrooms there will be two brick water fountains<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Standing at the eastern most water fountain, look towards 210 <br/>
degrees <br/>
&gt; where you will see the intersection of 3 stone walls, that's your <br/>
&gt; next point.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From this intersection look for a Y shaped tree @ 220 degrees. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the tree look towards 255 degrees, you will see a stairway <br/>
next <br/>
&gt; to a tree.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Behind this large tree you find the box tucked under a rock. After <br/>
&gt; stamping in go to the top of the stairs. Your car is in a 20 degree <br/>
&gt; direction across the fields. Happy hunting!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This hike is not difficult. The park is a beautiful place to <br/>
explore. <br/>
&gt; I recommend continuing deeper into the woods. That's where you<br/>
&gt; will <br/>
&gt; find the Brandywine. The park does charge an entrance fee from May <br/>
1-<br/>
&gt; Oct 31. Daily $2.50 DE residents &amp; $5.00 out-of-state residents.<br/>
