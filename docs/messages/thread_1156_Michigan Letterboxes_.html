<br/>
I am new to this group (and completely new to the wonderful world of <br/>
Letterboxing). I found Tom Cooch's virtual "Letterbook" last week and <br/>
now I am hooked.<br/>
<br/>
My question is, are they any other Michigan Letterboxes besides the <br/>
one in Dexter (as indicated on the LBNA site)? My family and I are <br/>
going to find that this weekend. If not, my next opportunity to <br/>
Letterbox isn't until I visit my sister in Connecticut next June!<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I already have plans to place three more in Michigan <br/>
(and our list of possible locations is growing). We'll announce them <br/>
when we do. I'd love to see this become as popular in Michigan as it <br/>
is elsewhere in the States!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any input!<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In order to promote the hobby in your area a few things you can do:<br/>
<br/>
1) The best way to get it rolling in your neighborhood is to start putting<br/>
some boxes out.  I do enjoy finding boxes, but I do have to say: it is<br/>
even more fun hiding them.  I know that some people are simply hooked on<br/>
hiding the boxes. Then the real joy is when you go back to find who<br/>
came for a visit.<br/>
<br/>
2) Take a friend or couple along with you who enjoys nature. If you are<br/>
able to get them interested in the hobby, then it will take off very<br/>
quickly. You will start to swap clues and find the boxes hidden by the<br/>
other.  <br/>
<br/>
3) Visit a local outfitter or wilderness club.  AMC, Serria, EMS, REI,<br/>
etc..  I am sure they would love to hold a workshop on letterboxing if you<br/>
are able to get one of their members/managers interested in the<br/>
hobby. You will not believe the amount of advertising power this may<br/>
provide...<br/>
<br/>
Just a few suggestions...<br/>
