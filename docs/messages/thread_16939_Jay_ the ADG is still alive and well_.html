encouraging comments in his interview.  <br/>
<br/>
I honestly stopped posting on this site because I got bitter due to <br/>
all of the sniping.  (uh, oh, I smell a flamewar!)<br/>
<br/>
Plus we were totally obsessed for the first year but then our lives <br/>
started creeping back in and we just didn't make time to box a lot.  <br/>
We are still in contact with the local boxers and hope to make a <br/>
comeback next year.<br/>
<br/>
Sarah, our master carver, also got involved in lots of other crafty <br/>
projects but I am sure if I ask and inspire her with new ideas that <br/>
she will carve some new marvels for the ADG.  <br/>
<br/>
So thanks for the reference.  It is nice to know that someone out <br/>
there enjoyed the stamps, the clues, the humor and the slightly off <br/>
kilter remarks.<br/>
<br/>
Box On,<br/>
