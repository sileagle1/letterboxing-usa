I've come across a Krylon (Spray Paint) product called Plastic Primer. Using<br/>
it on the Tupperware boxes first then allows mew to spray any other spray<br/>

All of this is to cover up one thing... The glaring whiteness of the<br/>
Tupperware boxes themselves.  I was able to see one of my boxes that had<br/>
become uncovered recently from almost 25 feet away.  The white stuck out<br/>
like a sore thumb.  Since I've started camouflage the boxes, I've had people<br/>
walk right over them and not see them.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
ScoutDogs!   I knew I'd get it backwards.   The other problem I had with the <br/>
tape was, if I made the decision to put it on there right before I planted the <br/>
bos (i.e., out on the trail) I never had a good pair of scissors with me to <br/>
trim it, so the ends were all raggedy.   Still, it looks darned good, and <br/>
blends in way better than the bright blue tops on my boxes did.<br/>
<br/>
I'll get around to trying paint pretty soon, but I've heard stories of those <br/>
who've tried it only to have it scrape off if you even look at it too hard, so <br/>
I want to be sure I get good paint that'll stick awhile.<br/>

That's why I use the Krylon Plastic Primer.  It makes it so the other<br/>
Krylon<br/>
(And perhaps other brands) paints will stick to the plastic.  I've also<br/>
discovered that when I use paint, if I let it cure for 72 hours, it<br/>
adheres<br/>

I've purchased it at hardware stores and WalMart in the spray paint section.<br/>
<br/>
They also have the camouflage paint colors in the same section - those that<br/>
I have are also by Krylon and do say 'camouflage paint system' right on the<br/>
can.  They're easily identifiable by the green and black camo color on the<br/>

I got mine at Lowes in their paint section, not sure if it is available<br/>
elsewhere, but I don't think craft stores would carry it, it's primary<br/>
use<br/>
is for prepping lawn furniture for painting.<br/>

That works just as well, though I think I figured the cost per container to<br/>
be cheaper by using the Krylon Plastic Primer then using another cheaper<br/>
$0.99 spray paint.<br/>

&gt; I wanted to share some camouflage information with everyone.  Given <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; recent loss of 40% of our letterboxes, I was getting worried.  We <br/>
went out<br/>
&gt; and looked things over and I've come to the problem is not <br/>
necessarily with<br/>
&gt; just poor re-hiding, but maybe even poor initial hiding.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've taken to now camouflaging our new boxes being placed in the <br/>
field.<br/>
&gt; I've come across a Krylon (Spray Paint) product called Plastic <br/>
Primer. Using<br/>
&gt; it on the Tupperware boxes first then allows mew to spray any other <br/>
spray<br/>
&gt; paint color I want. I use Tan, Olive, Black and Brown as my primary <br/>
colors,<br/>
&gt; in a sorta camouflage type of pattern.  I've also started following <br/>
Warrior<br/>
&gt; Woman's idea of using burlap as an addition wrap as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All of this is to cover up one thing... The glaring whiteness of the<br/>
&gt; Tupperware boxes themselves.  I was able to see one of my boxes <br/>
that had<br/>
&gt; become uncovered recently from almost 25 feet away.  The white <br/>
stuck out<br/>
&gt; like a sore thumb.  Since I've started camouflage the boxes, I've <br/>
had people<br/>
&gt; walk right over them and not see them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, my fake rock experiment was a resounding success.  Not one <br/>
person<br/>
&gt; asked to look in a certain area to find the beta test letterbox <br/>
could even<br/>
&gt; see it, let alone discover the letterbox.<br/>
