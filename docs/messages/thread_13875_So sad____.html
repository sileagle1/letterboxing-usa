<br/>
After careful and agonizing deliberation, the Alphabet Bandits have decided to prioritize and not attend the Bucks Co. gathering.  boohoohooo!<br/>
<br/>
With camp just a week away, there just not enough DAYS in the hour to get it all in.... so alas, we wish you all great boxing weather, lotsa wonderful exchanges, many boxious finds and a great day with friends.<br/>
<br/>
We will be very scarce of the next few weeks, going no-mail on Sunday (6/29) until mid August.  We hope to get at least one box in during July... hey! you never know.<br/>
<br/>
It's been great, and we can't wait to get back on list!<br/>
<br/>
Have a Happy 4th of July<br/>
<br/>
