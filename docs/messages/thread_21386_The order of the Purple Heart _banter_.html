"I actually got nominated and AYED! twice.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Going out to confirm that a friend's letterbox really, really,<br/>
really, REALLY was missing..."<br/>
<br/>
...Well, there was that big rock that held 2 missing boxes until a third <br/>
was ready and we found them just because we kept looking...and digging... <br/>
deeper and deeper... And then there were _3_!  Viking Ships at Sunrise... <br/>
so ya never know!  Of the things one can admire about fellow or sister <br/>
'boxers, tenacity is high on my list.<br/>
<br/>
"I stepped barefoot on a large buried oyster shell that was wedged in<br/>
the sand at a 90 degree angle to my foot.  It lodged into my foot so<br/>
deep that when I lifted my foot, the oyster shell was *still* stuck<br/>
into my foot!  After I yanked the shell out of my foot, I had to go<br/>
back along the rather long trail to my car - at which point I knew I<br/>
needed medical attention, and had to say to myself "what would<br/>
MacGyver do?".'<br/>
<br/>
But I really think you should've stayed with me that day of the bloody <br/>
shell, cuz that turtle of Aesop's had the right idea.  You left out the part <br/>
where you took a shortcut on the "road less traveled." (i.e. - a slippery, <br/>
eroded bank down to a beach of flotsam, jetsam, and storm tide debris.) <br/>
Maybe that oyster shell was not meant to be discovered by your poor foot. <br/>
You were wearing sandals, yes?  I'm not scolding, maybe chiding; you'd best <br/>
any Spartan, WW.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I whipped out a bottle of Windex to wash and<br/>
disinfect my foot, then wrapped duct tape around it to keep it<br/>
covered.  Then I went after another letterbox in the same park."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That gash was gross.  When does tenacity become "excessive stubbornness" or <br/>
even "boxing with a vengeance"?  I'm glad I didn't have to carry you.  <s> <br/>
You still should get an award.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"2.  Hunting down boxes in Hopkinton State Park, MA (Danielle's 15th),<br/>
yes, that was me, covered in yellow jackets, screaming and ripping<br/>
off my clothes.  Although I was welted up for some time, I only have<br/>
about 5 nasty scars from the 20+ stings I received."<br/>
<br/>
And you looked absolutely drop-dead gorgeous in an elegant bare-back gown <br/>
just days later.  You are a marvel.   Order of the Purple (but I prefer <br/>
plum) Heart indeed.  Could the new ink pad be a pretty plum color?  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"That's why I was wondering if the Order of the Purple Heart PLB was<br/>
an urban myth.  It never came my way either time."<br/>
<br/>
Well, boxes have a way of reappearing, so hang in there.  Maybe we need a <br/>
new one to be created in order for the original to resurface.  Boxes are <br/>
like that. Yah, they are.<br/>
