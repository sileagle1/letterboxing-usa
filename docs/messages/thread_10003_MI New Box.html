<p><strong>Good Dogs need Socialization</strong></p>
<p><strong>By DogIsMyCoPirate</strong></p>
<p>(Dog Scouts of America "Good Dog" series)</p><b>
</b><p>State: Michigan</p>
<p>County: Roscommon</p>
<p>Nearby Towns: Houghton Lake, St. Helen</p>
<p>Approximate distance: A little over a mile</p>
<p>Approximate time: (depends on your pace, and whether you stop to play in the 
playground!) 30 minutes?</p>
<p>Difficulty (Clues): Easy</p>
<p>Difficulty (Terrain): Easy (flat ground, narrow 2-track in a township 
park)</p>
<p>The clues for finding the letterboxes in this series all have to do with 
creating a good dog. To "decode" the clues, answer the questions on this short 
quiz. For more information about properly socializing your dog see the Dog 
Scouts of America web site </p><a href="http://www.dogscouts.org/">www.dogscouts.org</a>. There’s 
lots of free information there to help you raise a dog to be a perfect 
companion. 
<p>The "Socialization" letterbox is a small tupperware-type container with a 
white lid. The entire thing is in a large zip-loc baggie, because I didn’t trust 
the integrity of the box in the Michigan weather. FYI the steps constitute ONE 
footfall, made by a 5’7" adult.</p>
<p>This letterbox is in Wa-ku-i park in Prudenville (on M-55, about 1  miles 
west of I-75 exit 227). It is a little roadside park, but actually includes many 
acres with woods and hiking trails. You will have a nice walk of a little over a 
mile. You can park in the parking lot (near the picnic table) and proceed to 
locate the correct trail by answering the following question:</p>
<ol><b>
<li>True or False</li></b> By properly socializing your puppy during his critical 
  socialization period, your dog will be less likely to fear unusual situations 
  as an adult, and less likely to bite because he is terrified of new stimuli. 
  He will have fewer phobias and behavior problems and will be very 
  self-confident and intellegent. In short, taking the time to socialize your 
  puppy to all environments, people, sights, sounds, and surfaces is 
  <b>critical</b> to having a calm, attentive, easily trainable dog.<b>
</b><p>T If you answered "True" then take the trail that goes <b>west</b> of 
  the lake.</p><b>
</b><p>F If you answered "False" then take a the trail that goes parallel to 
  the telephone poles, <b>east</b> of the lake, and promise you’ll only ever get 
  stuffed dogs.</p>
<p>Follow the two-track north, through a gate and continue along until you see 
  a small playground off in the woods beside the trail. Just past this spot, 
  there will be a circular turn-around spot. To find out where to go, answer 
  this question:</p>
<p> </p><b>
<li>True or False</li></b> The critical socialization period for puppies is from 8 
  weeks to 16 weeks, during which time they must be introduced to as many 
  different kinds of people, other animals, places and situations as possible to 
  maximize their learning as an adult. After the age of 16 weeks, you have 
  pretty much lost your window for making an impression, so it is critical to 
  introduce your puppy in a neutral or positive way to as many things as 
  possible before he reaches 4 months of age.<b>
</b><p>T If you answered "True" then continue on down the two-track that winds 
  around behind the marsh (about 70 degrees)</p><b>
</b><p>F If you answered "False" then take a the trail to the left, beyond the 
  turn-around (280 degrees), and read up on the critical importance of early 
  socialization.</p>
<p>Up ahead, you will come to another trail splitting off to the right. Answer 
  the following question to see where to go:</p><b>
<li>True or False</li></b> There is no such thing as a "fear imprint period." If 
  your puppy is frightened or has a traumatic experience between the age of 8 to 
  9 weeks, he will not be scarred for life. So you don’t need to be particularly 
  careful during this time not to startle your puppy, or allow him near 
  unsupervised children, and you should not postpone traumatic surgeries (like 
  ear cropping) until after this period is over.<b>
</b><p>T If you answered "True" then take a compass heading of 115 degrees and 
  increase your homeowner’s insurance coverage.</p><b>
</b><p>F If you answered "False" then take a compass heading of 45 degrees and 
  stay on the main trail<b>.</b></p>
<p>You’ll notice some signs that warn "no hunting or firearms" on the left as 
  you continue down the trail. You’ll come to a spot where the road splits and 
  you could go right or left. Answer the following to get your compass 
  heading:</p><b>
<li>True or False</li></b> The "rule of sevens" says that during each of the 8 
  weeks of your puppy’s critical socialization period, you should introduce your 
  puppy in a neutral or positive way to:</ol>
<dir>
<p>7 different people (old, young, male, female, wearing hats, using canes, 
walking funny, etc)</p>
<p>7 different surfaces (carpet, tile, linoleum, grass, dirt, sand, gravel, 
cement, carpet grass, steps, wet surfaces, etc.)</p>
<p>7 different places (vet’s office, park, pet shop, baseball game, friend’s 
house, back yard, woods, puppy training class, buildings with elevators)</p>
<p>7 different kinds of food </p><b>
</b><p>T If you answered "True" then take a compass heading of 345 
degrees</p></dir><b>
</b><p>F If you answered "False" then take a compass heading of 90 degrees and 
think about getting a goldfish instead of a dog.</p>
<p>You’ll be walking beside an area that has been clear-cut. There are many 
stumps of Maple, Birch and Pine trees. Answer the question below to find the 
number of steps you take before you arrive at your next clue:</p>
<p>5. <b>True or False </b>It is okay to adopt a puppy any time after it is 
weened at 5 weeks of age. Your puppy will can make up for all of the valuable 
training, social skills, and dog language he would have learned by staying with 
the litter until at least seven weeks of age by reading books. Your puppy will 
not bite your hands because he never learned bite inhibition from his 
littermates between 6 and 7 weeks of age. He will also not ever accidentally 
bite down too hard when he is an adult, possibly causing the need for stitches, 
because he never learned to inhibit his biting from age 6 to 7 weeks with his 
littermates.</p>
<dir><b>
</b><p>T If you answered "True" then count off 130 steps, buy some bandages and 
increase your homeowner’s insurance coverage.</p></dir><b>
</b><p>F If you answered "False" then count off 205 steps.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the correct number of steps, to your right, you’ll see the stumps of 
three large Maples cut off near ground level, with lots of little baby Maple 
shoots springing out of the trunks. It makes them look like three shrubs 
parallel to the trail about 12 feet off the trail. When you reach the third of 
these "triplets" answer the question below to get the compass heading for where 
to go next:</p>
<p>6. <b>True or False</b> Some people’s concern about taking a puppy out before 
he has received all of his shots prevents them from properly socializing their 
puppy. When this dog grows up without proper socialization, he’s probably going 
to be fearful, overly excitable, difficult to train, and possibly dangerous to 
own. Chances are, he’s going to end up being banished to the back yard because 
of his poor behavior, or taken off to the pound. Eighty percent of dogs that are 
surrendered to animal shelters and pounds are given up due to behavior problems. 
Only 20% of dogs that are surrendered to pounds and shelters ever find homes. We 
can guess which 80% are having to be euthanized (killed). When forced to choose 
between socialization and possible exposure to germs and viruses that could 
potentially harm your puppy, remember that an unsocialized dog often ends up a 
dead dog, anyway. Socialization is the first step in a long and happy 
relationship with a <b>good dog</b>.</p>
<dir><b>
</b><p>T If you answered "True" then take a compass heading of 40 
degrees</p></dir><b>
</b><p>F If you answered "False" then take a compass heading of 230 degrees and 
go take a tour of your nearest animal shelter.</p>
<p>You’re going "offroad" 28 steps in this direction, where you will find a 
double-trunked pine. The letter box is at the root of this stump, just as lack 
of socialization is at the root of most behavior problems. </p>

people play with their dogs. If you’re not familliar with this author, <b>look
