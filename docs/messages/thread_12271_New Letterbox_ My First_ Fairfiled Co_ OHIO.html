The Hidden Ankh<br/>
<br/>
By Imothep The Discoverer<br/>

<br/>
Greenfield Lake Recreation Area<br/>
Lancaster, Fairfield County, Ohio<br/>
First Letterbox placed in Fairfield Co.<br/>
Difficulty:2<br/>
NOTE: You will need a pen, an ink pad, a compass, and a pair of old <br/>
shoes as this park tends to be muddy.<br/>
<br/>
DRIVING DIRECTIONS: From Columbus, take U.S. 33 south toward <br/>
Lancaster.  Go left(east)on Coonpath Rd.  Entrance to park is on the <br/>
left side of the road, 0.8 mi. past the 4-way intersection with <br/>
Election House Rd.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES: Take the western trail leading from the parking area.  Turn <br/>
right at the junction.  The trail will begin to wind up and down a <br/>
group of small hills and slight turns.  Ignore the smaller paths <br/>
branching off to the fishing areas.  The trail begins to level off <br/>
as the path gets smaller.  Soon you will come to a junction.  The <br/>
left path leads to a fishing spot and a bog, while the right path <br/>
leads into the woods.  Take the right path and start counting.  <br/>
After 35 paces, stop and look right(east).  You should be able to <br/>
see a large, wooden, double-poled power line support tower with <br/>
three large ceramic arms.  Walk to the easternmost point of the <br/>
support tower, carefully avoiding briars, and take a reading of 48 <br/>
degrees.  Walk in that direction in a straight line for 25 paces <br/>
until you come up on a pile of old, dead logs.  The Letterbox is in <br/>
the center of the pile underneath a white log. <br/>
<br/>
This is my first letterbox, so feel free to e-mail me and let me <br/>
know how it went finding it or if it is damaged.<br/>
