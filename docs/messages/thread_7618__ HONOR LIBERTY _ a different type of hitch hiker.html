" HONOR LIBERTY " will be launched at Pt Vicente Lighthouse letterbox in 
California. Please pick it up soon and replant it quickly and POST WHERE IT WAS 
PLANTED ! It will be in it's own container , have it's own book , and stamp 
pads. The object is to move it across the country with the utmost haste logging 
in the locations it visits and the sentiments it collects .On 9-11-03 we would 
like the box returned to us , instructions are included, and we will post the 
locations and sentiments on the list when we receive the box back. Remember to 
post it's current location not where it's been. Don &amp; Gwen</div>
