                    <div class="plaintext-content">I understand there is a Renaissance fair scheduled for McCormick Park in the <br/>
end of July, put on by some Portland organization.  Some construction on the <br/>
park roads while we were there and maybe putting in an additional parking <br/>
structure?   I suspect that the two events are related.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I am still happily learning and continue to appreciate any input <br/>
from other letterboxers.   Thanks.  <br/>

Good hunting!<br/>
