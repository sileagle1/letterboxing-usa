&gt;  Don't discount the possibility of wildlife causing vandalism.<br/>
&gt;  ...Wild animals have excellent senses of smell, and deer<br/>
&gt;  have been caught red-handed stealing orienteering controls.<br/>
&gt;  ...don't reuse a container that once contained food (its<br/>
&gt;  impossible to wash the smell out),...<br/>
<br/>
I've heard that before, so I want to confirm it here.  If a<br/>
container has had food in it, then even if it is washed animals<br/>
may be attracted to it.  This would be true of anything inside<br/>
the container also.  I suppose if you had been eating salami or<br/>
potato chips just prior to putting your box together it will<br/>
leave behind an odor.<br/>
<br/>
I've heard stories about deer, racoons and bears that were rutting <br/>
around where only the most remote trace of food or food smell had<br/>
existed.  Apparently, if animals are hungry enough they will find<br/>
whatever trace of food smell there is.  And we know that rats (of<br/>
the animal type, that is) are excellent at rooting out stuff that<br/>
smells like... well, just about anything -- it does not even have<br/>
to be food, just something which gives off a pungent odor.<br/>
<br/>
So I just want to confirm Randy's strategy.  Since we can't be<br/>
one hundred percent certain about causes in all instances, let's<br/>
narrow down the likelihood of boxes disappearing through things we<br/>
could have controlled.  So please ensure that your containers are<br/>
fresh/new.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the input Randy.<br/>
