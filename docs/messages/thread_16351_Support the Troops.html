  It has been a long while since I have heard from the Support the Troops HH. As I mentioned once before I would like to see it keep moving as someone very special to me (brother-in-law) is in Iraq right now in an area of heavy action. <br/>
  Please Support The Troops HH was last heard of at Bradbury State Park in Maine. I think it may actually still be stuck there but I am not sure. If someone has seen it recently could you please report it and if someone in the area of Bradbury State Park in Maine would be willing to check on it and move it on it's way, I would really appreciate that too. <br/>
  If you would prefer to mail it back to me to get it into a new area I'll  pay shipping. <br/>

THE PATRIOT FILES<br/>
FILE #3<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 By, C. W. Standiford<br/>
 Author, BURY ME WITH SOLDIERS<br/>
 WWW.burymewithsoldiers.com<br/>
<br/>
 I was born an American, I live an American and I will die an American.<br/>
Daniel Webster<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Twenty-six year old Cody Standiford<br/>
nears completion of his training.<br/>
<br/>
 Back when William Jefferson Clinton was president my son Cody had enlisted<br/>
in the Navy. As a veteran who witnessed the politicians waste young blood on<br/>
a long protracted war I had some concerns that history might repeat itself<br/>
with a leader whom I felt had no understanding of honor, sacrifice and duty<br/>
to country. After a heartfelt conversation with Cody he opted to leave the<br/>
Navy and pursue other goals. I knew if our nation came under threat Cody<br/>
would serve and fight to protect our freedom.<br/>
<br/>
A few months back Cody calls me and states he has enlisted in the Army. I<br/>
had mixed emotions of pride and concern. I wished I was eighteen again and<br/>
could go in his place, but I am not and the torch has been passed to him and<br/>
his generation to fight the fight.<br/>
<br/>
A month ago Cody was home on a short leave. I watched his young son Wyatt<br/>
follow him around like a lonely puppy. The two missed each other dearly and<br/>
Codys wife Diane gripped Cody with loving holds that also proved she missed<br/>
her husband. It was a vivid picture of another cost of freedom.<br/>
<br/>
 As Cody nears the completion of his training in helicopter mechanics the<br/>
fatherly pangs follow me around as I hear of our young and brave paying the<br/>
ultimate price for our freedom.  I still fight the battle of trusting my<br/>
government with the blood of my blood, yet I understand that America is<br/>
bigger than any politician in power and it is the soldier that guards the<br/>
gates of freedom, not those sipping champagne as the fight continues. <br/>
<br/>
 Sooner or later Cody will be in a hot zone somewhere on this planet. I<br/>
realize that his life could be taken suddenly. I know the hazards of his<br/>
occupation and the price he, his son, his wife and our entire family could<br/>
pay. So I pray for his safety and the safety of all that serve, yet I know I<br/>
am not exempt from receiving that dreaded call. That knowledge has caused me<br/>
to ponder the dangers he might face and the discomforts of military combat<br/>
he could soon endure. It also makes me question if I could bury my son and<br/>
still hang on to my love of America. I ponder the possibility and shudder. I<br/>
also ponder the loss of my country and I tremble more. Do I love my country<br/>
more than my son? No, I love them both, but all of my children would not be<br/>
who they are if they were not Americans. The greatest gift Cody has offered<br/>
is his willingness to guard our land. If Cody were to become a mortal<br/>
casualty of war I would stand stoic over his flag draped coffin and save my<br/>
grief for my private closet. I would gently hand the folded flag to his son<br/>
with the knowledge that someday he may be called to fight and offer yet one<br/>
more gift to America.<br/>
<br/>
 If I could, I would turn back the clocks and slip into Codys skin and take<br/>
his place in this war. This would not be born out of my courage, but rather<br/>
it would quell the fear I have for him. Cody would reject this with words<br/>
that would sound something like,  It is my turn Dad, you stay home and let<br/>
me have the honor of serving my country.<br/>
<br/>
 From the Revolutionary War through today there have been thousands of men<br/>
and women like my son. We can sleep at night with assurance we will wake up<br/>
as a free nation. If you cannot get out of bed in the morning and understand<br/>
this simple fact then you either do not comprehend or you do not care. I<br/>
have become weary of the citizen and the politicians who have used the fog<br/>
of war in attempt to gain political power and advance their parties agenda<br/>
or to simply complain. Their hollow words echo through this land and then<br/>
onto the battlefields. We must reject the words of those who continually<br/>
look for faults as we struggle to keep America free. We must know our enemy<br/>
and continue the fight even as he has become the flea on the dog. We must<br/>
support our troops and our resolve must not waiver. Anything less will cause<br/>
the crack the enemy is waiting for. The men and women who stand guarding the<br/>
tree of liberty have offered their gift to you and I, they are the best we<br/>
have America, don't turn your backs on them. <br/>
<br/>
 In the next file- a young man dreams of becoming a Marine and states there<br/>
is nothing nobler than becoming a United States Marine. His dream is tested<br/>
in the first Gulf War as his heart attempts to go through his chest in the<br/>
very dark desert of Kuwait. <br/>

Hello Irish Tinker et all,<br/>
<br/>
I know that I cannot do much for helping the HH move along right now with my being here in Iraq. <br/>
<br/>
However, I can assure you that when I do return home to the good ol'USA I will do my best to track it down and push it a little further along on its journey.<br/>

If you run into any HHs and you want them to move, snail mail them to <br/>
me and I'll make *sure* they move.  Or, if you plan to attend the <br/>
Winter Gathering (I'm meeting with Jim Harvey over coffee next week <br/>
to pin down the dates and times), bring them along, and we'll have <br/>
them scattered to the four winds!<br/>

I went to Bradbury Mountain in early November of this year <br/>

Bradbury Mountian Letterbox, but there was no HH with the box.  This <br/>
sight had apparently been found by several people just by accident, <br/>
so it might have been picked up by any one of them and transported on <br/>
it's way.  Hope you have some luck finding it.<br/>

    I went to Bradbury Mountain in early November of this year <br/>
    specifically to rescue the "Support the Troops" HH.  We found the <br/>
    Bradbury Mountian Letterbox, but there was no HH with the box.  This <br/>
    sight had apparently been found by several people just by accident, <br/>
    so it might have been picked up by any one of them and transported on <br/>
    it's way.  Hope you have some luck finding it.<br/>
