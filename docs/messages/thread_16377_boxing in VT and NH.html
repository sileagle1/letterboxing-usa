<br/>
We, Bald Eagle and I, had a wonderful time boxing this past weekend!  What a gorgeous weekend up north and the foliage was spectacular!<br/>
<br/>
We camped at Quechee State Park, VT.  Actually placed 2 boxes nearby, check for clues later today or tonight!<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, after planting those 2 boxes we drove out to Killington to check on my first planted box, Kent Pond.  I was notified a couple of months ago that the book was gone so we were going out to replace it. I was afraid that the box might be missing since I had not heard anything more about it!  When we got there, there were several people nearby and we quickly realized that they had the box and were stamping in!  So not only was the box there but we got to meet the people who had just found it!  We also tripled our exchanges!<br/>
<br/>
They were from CT also.  We met Teddy Bear, Callie,KiaKahi, Queen B, NZJ, and Nicholas M.  The last 2 don't have stamps, this was the first time for them and they said they're hooked and can't wait to plant a box near their cabin in VT!<br/>
<br/>
After finishing with them we planted 2 more boxes in the area!  Check for those later also!<br/>
<br/>
On to finding boxes:<br/>
<br/>
Brownsville Lighthouse; good shape but not as easy a walk as we expected!<br/>
<br/>
Brownsville Cemetery; good shape, found Fall Journey HH<br/>
<br/>
A Box for Nonnie (i-89); good shape<br/>
<br/>
Sunday we went into NH for these:<br/>
<br/>
Mom's Rest Stop; could not find it<br/>
<br/>
Lake Mascoma; Very pretty area, we were first finders!<br/>
<br/>
Two-Fer; good shape but out in the open, we hid it much better!<br/>
<br/>
The One That Got Away;  another beautiful area, good shape<br/>
<br/>
Had to quit after that, those trails are hard on your feet!  Some of these were on the Northern Rail Trail, very pretty but hard packed surface.<br/>
<br/>
On our way home we looked for the Vermont Flower, it seems to be missing.<br/>
<br/>
We replaced many zip-locs for most of these boxes so they should all be dry for a while longer!<br/>
<br/>
It's just too bad we had to come home on such a beautiful day!<br/>
