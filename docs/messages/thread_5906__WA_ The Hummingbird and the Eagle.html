<br/>
Located in Tacoma, south of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. <br/>
Follow 6th Ave to Titlow Park<br/>
<br/>
Fairly easy terrain, one slight hill. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* Hummingbird Box<br/>
<br/>
Fitness it is the key to starting any physical activity correctly.<br/>
<br/>
Turn 360 and go that way.<br/>
<br/>
If you make it past that right pool without looking like a fool the remains<br/>
of slaughtered and carved up trees lead you across the water on the left.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. T says, "Go right fool!"<br/>
<br/>
Keep to the high road and soon the track will be left to you. Are those<br/>
Letterboxers signs on the tracks?  He placed 50 and found 60 and what is<br/>
that last one? How curious.<br/>
<br/>
Bends are for divers so you must be okay!<br/>
<br/>
Leaping logs stampers, from the "boarder" north is it T/4 or T/2 down the<br/>
trail to get to the right?<br/>
<br/>
I know it has to be the two out of one! The hummingbird is free for the<br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* Eagle Box<br/>
<br/>
Continue down the trail and then left<br/>
<br/>
Pull?<br/>
<br/>
Sit-up?<br/>
<br/>
Pushup bars right. Right?<br/>
<br/>
Go left<br/>
<br/>
See asphalt? Left.<br/>
<br/>
Over the steel rails and down past TOA you go.<br/>
<br/>
Second right.<br/>
<br/>
When you see the water best to be left.<br/>
<br/>
Always choose to be close to the water<br/>
<br/>
Covered area, Picnic tables, a wood bench and  bench and BAR-B-Q's you will<br/>
pass.<br/>
<br/>
A Madrona tree divides the trail but if not careful, you will go left so be<br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
Seven paces to a larger Madrona tree and you are there.<br/>
<br/>
The Eagle has landed.<br/>
