directed at the group because I felt so bad about your stamp being<br/>

person could be shamed into returning it.  I know that some people on<br/>
the list can be quite blunt and this is why I said "nice, polite,<br/>
non-flaming" messages requesting it's return. Nasty messages might <br/>
make the person think "tough sh-t" and keep it.  <br/>

Oh good then, your post made me all 'a flustered' and re-read my <br/>
posting on the geocaching site BIG SMOKE cache - I am thinking, well <br/>
now being a geek sometimes I do come on a bit strong so lets <br/>
see  ..gee I was trying to be nice, but I did put a angry face next <br/>
to the comment about combining the boxes. but on the other hand I <br/>
used the magic please word and offered to pay postage...so ha ha Oh <br/>
well to update you all on lost little fox: a person did contact me <br/>
perhaps it was earth moma but I am not sure, here is what I recieved <br/>
but since this I have responded back (politely I think) and I have <br/>
heard nothing again so far...<br/>

We are a little confused by your request. Can't remember a "Island <br/>
Fox Stamp" but asume it was in one of the Catalina caches. We are <br/>
searching through our stuff and hope to come up with it. Our house <br/>
is a bit dissorganized at present and the stamp could have got mixed <br/>
in with any of several groups of clutter. <br/>
