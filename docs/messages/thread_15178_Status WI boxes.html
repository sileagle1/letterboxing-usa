<br/>
* Eagle - Kettle Moraine South<br/>
    - box is there and in a good location. it was quite wet, however.  we dried the box out (it had alot of water inside), repackaged the log book in a new ziploc (soggy but still readable), and put the entire box into a heavy duty freezer ziploc bag.  the location it's in seems to get alot of run off rain so we wanted to do what we could to assure dryness.<br/>
<br/>
* River Watch Letterbox - Fort Atkinson<br/>
    - box is probably MIA.  we found the part, the railroad bridge and the exact location, but no box.  they are doing some heavy duty construction in the area and it looks like the bridge will be gone eventually anyway.<br/>
<br/>
*Cam-Rock Canoe Launch - Cambridge<br/>
    - box is in a good location and well hidden.  however, the river is gone!  :-)  locals said the dam has been removed so the river used for canoeing from this launch has altered it's course.<br/>
<br/>
*Tyranena Letterbox - Lake Mills<br/>
    -finally found it despite some errors in the clues which led us all over the town!  it's dry, hidden, and has had many visitors.<br/>
