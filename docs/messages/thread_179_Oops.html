<br/>
"Re: Clues form",<br/>
<br/>
was meant to go out to Erik Davis as a private email.<br/>
Its not terribly private so I hope it is OK.  In it I talked about<br/>
how Erik's had a tough year, trials, etc.  Its up to him though<br/>
if he wants to discuss the details of that with you.<br/>
<br/>
I also said in it that I have private correspondence with Randy<br/>
(PA) and Bonita (MA).  I actually have private correspondence with <br/>
many of you.  I want to say that my impressions of everyone I've contacted<br/>
beyond letterboxing discussions are very positive.  I think you are all great<br/>
people, very good to know some of you at whatever<br/>
personal level email will allow.<br/>
<br/>
But I guess I shouldn't be using the list here to go too deeply into this. <br/>
Mainly, I just wanted to do some "damage control" here.  I hope no one was<br/>
offended too badly at my mistakenly transmitted private message.  If anyone was,<br/>
esp. those mentioned, I'm very sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Daniel<br/>
