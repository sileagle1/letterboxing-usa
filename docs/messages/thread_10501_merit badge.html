&gt; I was a boy scout growing up in the 90s, there is already an orienteering<br/>
&gt; merit badge which works off a system where each flag found has a hole<br/>
&gt; punch specific to itself...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Maybe as a start, it could be an alternate requirement in the orienteering <br/>
&gt; MB.<br/>
<br/>
Orienteering and American-style letterboxing have nothing in common.  <br/>
Orienteering is a map reading sport.  American-style letterboxing rarely<br/>
involves a map (the crux of orienteering), and is a hiking, puzzle solving, <br/>
artistic pastime.  I don't know too much about how the boy scouts set up <br/>
the requirements for these merit badges, but I personally feel making <br/>
orienteering and letterboxing interchangible doesn't make sense.<br/>
<br/>
Ed Scott (http://www.talon.net/scottdvoa/) has a good page on Scout <br/>
orienteering, including the requirements for the orienteering merit badge.<br/>
As can be seen, not at all related to letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
In my mind, the Valley Quest program is closest to what seems appropriate<br/>
for this merit badge, as the whole motivation for the program is to use<br/>
"treasure hunt" models to get kids to discover and explore the communities'<br/>
history, environment, and heritage.  Of course, alot of boxes listed on<br/>
lbna have educational value, but the VQ program just feels more like a<br/>
merit badge ... hard to describe ...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
