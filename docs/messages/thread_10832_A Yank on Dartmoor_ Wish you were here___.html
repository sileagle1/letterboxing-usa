                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi there, <br/>
            just thought that some of you in the states would like to <br/>
know that a member of this group.. letterboxer2002... has arrived <br/>
from the states safe and well and is currently camping in Princetown, <br/>
Dartmoor.On Sunday we took him to Cranmere Pool. It was freezing <br/>
cold, the ground was frozen but alas no snow.<br/>
Today he has been out and about collecting large numbers of stamps <br/>
and having a ball!<br/>
The Dartmoor Letterboxing Club is currently taking good care of <br/>
Letterboxer2002 and I hope he returns home with a mass of stamps. I f <br/>
any of you have plans to come to Dartmoor, just let me know and we <br/>
will do the same for you. You never know a group of us limeys might <br/>
just visit the states one day to collect a few of your stamps.<br/>
Hope the big freeze soon thaws over there, we have the same problem <br/>
over here when it snows. Because of all the rocks on Dartmoor you <br/>
have to be so careful where you put your feet!. Usually the boxes are <br/>
weel frozen in under the rocks too.<br/>
I will put a photo of letterboxer2002 on the photo page for you all <br/>
to see. Hope he doesn't mind!<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

If I EVER  get there, be sure you will know and can ferry me around to all the best spots.<br/>
