                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, I am brand new to this Yahoo Group. I wanted to send this to the <br/>
letterboxing site but don't see a contact mail address to do that so <br/>
I will post this here and maybe someone can benefit from this <br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
I did one letterbox hike last summer with my children and another <br/>
family. I hope to do more family letterboxing hikes and I may even <br/>
place some letterboxes. I am so happy that so many letterboxes are in <br/>
my area.<br/>
<br/>
I am also considering starting a letterboxing club for homeschooled <br/>
children, I homeschool my kids. This would be a way to get out in <br/>
nature and of course, have fun. It is nice with homeschooling, to <br/>
have the freedom in our schedule to hike 7 days per week, and during <br/>
regular "school days" such as great spring days and crisp autumn <br/>
days. <br/>
<br/>
Making own stamps:<br/>
Thanks for the instructions on the site about making our own stamps. <br/>
I want to share an idea I came up with which is an adaptation of your <br/>
foot pad idea. I hope you share this idea on your website if you feel <br/>
it is worthwhile. You have my permission to share this idea and to <br/>
use any of my writing in order to put the information online. <br/>
<br/>
After reading your directions, I intended to use the foot pads but <br/>
only could find one package/style that was not medicated! The non-<br/>
medicated pads were $3 for one pack (Dr. Sholl brand) and they were <br/>
weird oval shapes. I felt this was too expensive and didn't allow <br/>
enough options for designs.(There were about a dozen different shapes <br/>
in the medicated version.)<br/>
<br/>
I had an idea to use regular craft foam sheets aka "foamies" instead. <br/>
These foam sheets may be purchased at any craft store or on the <br/>
internet. They are sold individually, with one 8.5"x11" sheet ranging <br/>
from 40 cents to 80 cents. They are also sold in packets, such as 40 <br/>
sheets for under $4. These are more versatile than the foot pads as <br/>
they allow the person to cut out any shape they want and make the <br/>
stamp any size they want. I tested the foam sheets and they work fine <br/>
as stamps, both the very, very thin ones, and of course the sheets <br/>
that are thicker at 1/4 inch thick, work as well. These foam sheets <br/>
don't require peeling as some of the foot pads do, you just cut, glue <br/>
it on, and you are done.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an example of a foam sheet packet of 40, selling for $3.71:<br/>

ProductID=86682&amp;GCID=C10601x061<br/>
<br/>
Here is an example of one single foam sheet:<br/>
http://www.createforless.com/products/productDetail.asp?<br/>
ProductID=86680&amp;GCID=C10601x061<br/>
<br/>
Buckets and sheets of die cut shapes are also sold, such as basic <br/>
geometric shapes and even fancy holiday themed shapes. Some of these <br/>
even have peel-off backings with adhesive already on them, while <br/>
others require glue. These precut designs could be used with very <br/>
young children who are too young to use scissors and create their own <br/>
shapes. Buckets are inexpensive also at about $8 full retail or as <br/>
low as $5 on sale.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The sheets tend to have the intricate holiday designs or a theme <br/>
(i.e. sea creatures). Here is an example of a 50 piece packet that <br/>
sells for just $2:<br/>

<br/>
I am using recycled wood scraps as the base, which I had purchased <br/>
(in the past and already had on hand), for a very low price at a <br/>
craft store, labeled as factory seconds pine wood scraps. The jar <br/>
lids I had were not flat because they had a vacuum seal style, which <br/>
is so common now, and it caused problems with uneven stamping when I <br/>
did a trial run. If jar lids are used perhaps you can suggest to make <br/>
sure the surface is entirely flat.<br/>
<br/>
Making your own blank journal book:<br/>
I also found a great site with instructions to make your own hardback <br/>
journal book, a small sized book. I adapted these directions by <br/>
omitting the spine and by using two signatures only as I felt these <br/>
young children didn't need a very thick journal, theirs is 44 pages. <br/>
If you follow these directions, the book would be 144 pages. Many <br/>
different recycled materials (paper, cardboard, wallpaper sample <br/>
books, old wrapping paper, etc.) may be used to make these journal <br/>
books.<br/>

<br/>
Children's Birthday Party-Letterboxing:<br/>
Today I am hosting a letterboxing children's birthday party for my <br/>
son who is turning five years old. The 16 children, aged 2-8, will be <br/>
designing their own stamp at the clearing at the trailhead. I am <br/>
giving a small, inexpensive compass as a "gift" and will teach them <br/>
how to use it. They will each get their own journal book which as I <br/>
said before, I made by hand using some recycled materials. I will <br/>
teach them the "no trace" ethics protocol. They will hike and find <br/>
the letterboxes as a group (hiking with parents as well). We will <br/>
conclude by having cupcakes, picnic style, at the preserve's field. <br/>
Wish me luck! <br/>

<br/>
Welcome to LbNA. I've tried making a stamp from foam sheets and didn't<br/>
c are for the results. It works better as a backing and you're right<br/>
that it sounds like a good way for kids to make their own stamp more<br/>
safely. <br/>
<br/>
I found it hard to transfer an image to foam and it was difficult to<br/>
get detail when cutting it. Also, the stamped image wasn't as dark<br/>
unless I really worked the ink into the foam.<br/>
<br/>
We'd prefer that you post comments that include commercial links into<br/>
a talk list designed for that, BoxHeads, as many members prefer not to<br/>
see commercial references in this main list.<br/>

Thanks and welcome!<br/>
