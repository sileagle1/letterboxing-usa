                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are new to letterboxing. This is the second letterbox we have <br/>
looked for. We were successful with our first search but unsuccessful <br/>
with our search for this one. Each of us tried seperatly to find it <br/>
and made several attempts but without success. We are wondering if <br/>
anyone has been at this box lately or if has been removed either <br/>
intenionally or unintenionally. Being new to to this activity it <br/>
shook our confidence in our navigation skills.<br/>
Thanks for any and all help.<br/>
