I'll be hiking the Buck Hollow/Buck Ridge trail this weekend.  Unless <br/>
I can convince my 16 year old daughter to join me, I'll be hiking <br/>
solo.  It seemed a very popular trail in October.  Did you encounter <br/>
many hikers last weekend?  I'll be starting at the 211 trailhead <br/>
which will be the reverse of the route we took in October, as we <br/>
entered from the Drive.  If there's much ice left, we might be <br/>
sliding down the steep section of the Buck Ridge Trail.  I've got two <br/>
more boxes ready to plant there.  Hopefully many more letterboxers <br/>
will seek them out and enjoy a great trail at Shenandoah NP.<br/>

I have a bad ankle that doesn't want to hike long or climb high so an easy <br/>
box for the Squirrel would be nice and a very hard one for the Jolly G-man. <br/>
Have fun and be safe. <br/>
<br/>
Virginia is really filling up. Good job!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Have no fear Squirrel...when you next scurry through Richmond, you'll <br/>
find some easy and fun hunts to take.  All the boxes at Pocohontas, <br/>
York River, and Virginia Beach area pretty flat and enjoyable walks.  <br/>
There's a short, but very steep and slippery hill at Belle Isle, but <br/>
once on the top, the walk to the box is very easy.<br/>
<br/>
Come on down....<br/>
