<br/>
There will be no white shirts!  I would like to do a dark color but I don't know how well the image will show up on them.  Gray might be the finall choice.<br/>
<br/>
Sizes: Adult small to I believe 2 or 3x.  I would say go with your regular size.<br/>
<br/>
The t-shirts are short sleeved and the sweatshirts are long sleeved.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I can do kids sizes, I don't know how those run, maybe order a size up so they last longer!  Those kids have a way of growing as soon as you buy them something new!!<br/>
<br/>
NO  I will not be posting an image of the design online.  The image on the shirt is a full color imprint of the event stamp and will be kept secret until Oct. 2nd.  I suppose if you really don't want to take a chance in advance you can pay the extra $5.00 and I can make you one after the event and mail it to you!  Trust me, you'll like it!<br/>
<br/>
For everyone who has contacted me already I will reply back to you in the next day or two.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great weekend, should be perfect for boxing, at least in New England!<br/>
