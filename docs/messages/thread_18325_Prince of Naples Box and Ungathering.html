<br/>
Looks like we pulled off a good surprise - on most of you. Our Prince<br/>
of Naples 2 hour, limited edition letterbox was a front for an<br/>
ungathering, starring Randy Hall/Mapsurfer.<br/>
<br/>
I arranged this with Randy shortly after he did the interview for us<br/>
on our website back in the fall. Randy wanted something quiet, not<br/>
advertising his name and in such a way that we had to get boxers to a<br/>
place, then have them find out that it was a gathering!<br/>
<br/>
So I came up with a 2 hour letterbox and you know the rest of the<br/>
story. Randy was there but the biggest stars were those 35 loyal,<br/>
wonderful letterboxing friends of ours who braved the rain and the<br/>
mud. Hopefully the gathering was their reward and Randy was a bonus.<br/>
<br/>
How do you find people willing to drive from RI, MA, NY and the far<br/>
reaches of CT except in this crazy letterboxing world of ours?<br/>
Special thanks to Randy, Jay Drew for carving the ungathering stamp<br/>
and all of our friends who showed up and made this a most special day.<br/>
The day ended with about 10 of us sharing stories over some grinders<br/>
and beer at a local restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
Sue and I want to thank all who attended from the bottom of our<br/>
hearts. This was truly above and beyond!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

Hey Mark,<br/>
<br/>
I am recently new to letterboxing. However, due to your great webpage, I've<br/>
read your interview with Mapsurfer/Randy Hall. Thanks for that one and all<br/>
of your other great interviews.<br/>
<br/>
What a great letterboxy way of having dedicated seekers meet on the QT. It<br/>
must have been quite a surprise for everyone when they found their way to<br/>
the ungathering.<br/>
<br/>
I'm way out in Washington state; so couldn't quite make it. But next time<br/>
for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Keep on seeking,<br/>
