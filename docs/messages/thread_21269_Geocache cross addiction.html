I've kind of ignored it for awhile, but I couldn't<br/>

didn't call for GPS.  In the cache was $1.05 (ugh!  I<br/>

AFLAC duck (hubby's an AFLAC agent).  <br/>
<br/>
Frankly, it seems a little stark.  The log I found<br/>
wasn't much to look at and enjoy.  I doubt I'll ever<br/>
go out of my way to find a cache, but I'll probably<br/>
check around to see if there are any where I'm going,<br/>
particularly while I'm boxing.<br/>

I tried looking for a few geocaches after borrowing a GPS,<br/>
but was unsuccessful, since even with coordinates you have<br/>
to tramp over a large area looking for the cache and I hated <br/>
doing that to the environment.  I have found a few accidentally<br/>
while looking for a letterbox and some have been pretty nice.<br/>
In one cache I got a pair of glasses with magnifying lenses<br/>
that I now wear while carving stamps!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's what I was wondering-how much of what would be<br/>
found in geocaches would be junk?  I thought the money<br/>
we found was kind of a no-brainer thing, but I wanted<br/>
to leave something that was kind of cool - not<br/>
necessarily expensive, but fun.  When someone opens<br/>
the cache we found, they're gonna see it is chuck full<br/>
of duck.  The AFLAC duck is made of stress ball<br/>
material and I have folks ask me if I can get them all<br/>
the time, so I figured it would be a fun, yet<br/>
inexpensive, something to leave behind.  But then, I'm<br/>
the one who loves to give and receive weird gifts -<br/>
once gave my father in law a sculpted bust of a<br/>
gorilla.  My mother-in-law proudly displays it in the<br/>
study and tells folks it is HIS great-great<br/>
grandfather.  <br/>
<br/>
Do you think the geocaching folks sit around on their<br/>
lists and talk about the merits of the trinkets and<br/>
what should and shouldn't be left in a cache???  I'll<br/>
bet they do!<br/>

We started with letterboxing,  but my husband got a GPS for the <br/>
search &amp; rescue team he is on so we started doing Geocache as a way <br/>
for him to learn how to use the GPS.<br/>
<br/>
And although we like the hunt of the stamps and the log books of the <br/>
letterboxing,  we have done all that are within an hour and less <br/>
than a 2 mile hike (since we have a 3 year old with us).  <br/>
Therefore,  at this pouint,  Letterboxing takes preparation and a <br/>
good bit of driving time (with a 3 year old).<br/>
<br/>
The fact that there are over 100 geocaches within about 30 minutes <br/>
of our house is a BIG draw since our primary goal was to get <br/>
outdoors and get our sons endurance up.<br/>
<br/>
Since there is such a concentration of geocaches,  we have found <br/>
lots of parks and other places where I hope to start placing boxes <br/>
next spring.<br/>
<br/>
I think Letterboxing will always be first- as we still jump to do <br/>
new ones and are planning two camping trips next summer around <br/>
letterboxing- but geocaching does have its draw.<br/>

I actually own a cheapo, but accurate GPS that I used to find a <br/>
couple LB/Cache hybrids in the Allentown area.  The experience was <br/>
not nearly as mentally stimulating or fulfilling as finding a well <br/>
crafted letterbox.  I liken it to eating a couple potato chips or <br/>
driving a car with automatic transmission (just put it in gear and <br/>
aim).  By contrast, letterboxing is like a rich chocolate cake with <br/>
nuanced flavors and like driving a car with a standard transmission <br/>
(you need to be thinking about what you're doing). Much more <br/>
intellectually satisfying.<br/>
<br/>
My son likes exchangiong the junque.  Someday anthropologists will <br/>
stumble across some fully laden geocaches and wonder "what the heck <br/>
is going on here?"  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The perception amongst geocachers is that letterboxers are snobs, <br/>
however the cachers that I have met are really cool people (just like <br/>
letterboxers).  Different Strokes.<br/>

We are also a letterboxing family that also lb's to get Bunny Boy (21 <br/>

I placed one hybrid geocache/letterbox and have found it <br/>

&gt; I am wondering how many of us are cross addicted to geocaching? <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately we have had only bad experiences with geocachers, but <br/>
that may be just bad luck?<br/>
<br/>
One of our 6 letterbox series was used by a geocacher for 5 way <br/>
points to reach his geocache. When we wrote him about his misuse of <br/>
our letterboxes, the letterboxes disappeared. There was one he <br/>
hadn't found-- a mystery clue box. Apparantly he couldn't figure out <br/>
the clues.<br/>
Another geocacher placed a geocache next to our letterbox in the <br/>
middle of the Greenhorn moutains. We moved that one, and wrote a <br/>
note advising that it is a big forest out there.<br/>
There have been at least two of our letterboxes that have had stamps <br/>
replaced with a toy.<br/>
Before we plant a letterbox we always scour the nearby likely spots <br/>
and look for any caches that might be stashed, and if any are found <br/>
then we find a different spot.<br/>
Maybe California geocachers are not as slick as those in other parts <br/>
of the country, but we have found that caching and letterboxing <br/>
don't mix well here.<br/>

One really neat thing tho, there is an avid cacher in my area who also<br/>

appeal to all three groups and works hard to insure smart placement of<br/>
caches and boxes.  I have to admire that!<br/>

&gt;flora.  The geocaches I have sought often have no clear trail leading to the<br/>
&gt;area and require one to tramp around a good bit before honing in on the<br/>
&gt;exact spot.  In fact, this has caused a lot of conflict within the local<br/>
&gt;parks and has given both letterboxers and responsible geocachers  a bad<br/>
&gt;reputation.  Anyone else finding this?<br/>
<br/>
I think that the more likely explanation isn't the attitudes or practices <br/>
of geocachers vs. letterboxers, but that there are so many more geocachers <br/>
than letterboxers. I wouldn't be surprised if there are 10 geocachers to <br/>
every one letterboxer, and that would result in 10 times as many attempts <br/>
to find a geocache compared to a letterbox. In dense letterboxing country, <br/>
you'll find social trails leading to a letterbox just as you would to a <br/>
geocache. I would agree that geocaching commonly comes to the attention of <br/>
parks officials well before letterboxing does, and both activities suffer <br/>
as a result, but I think it's more a result of numbers than practices.<br/>

&gt; I am wondering how many of us are cross addicted to geocaching?<br/>
<br/>
We've done a couple, and it was really fun, but it didn't "take." I <br/>
think the reason for us is that the thing is so regulated, so <br/>
actively managed. Maybe they have to do that since it's so BIG, but I <br/>
think it's more to do with them being commercial. The managers (can't <br/>
think of the name they use, maybe "facilitators?") have to approve <br/>
your clues and will edit them before allowing them on the website. <br/>
They will also delete your clues, even if you ask them not to. At <br/>
letterboxing.org, a crucial (and often overlooked) difference is that <br/>
you maintain the creative rights to your letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Still, come April 1st, we hope to do some more boxcaching! ;)<br/>

in an area that only has one and make sure that it's not <br/>

their loss. ;)<br/>

Geez.  It's like you're reading from a poster I have hanging in my <br/>
