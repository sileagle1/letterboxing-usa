<br/>
Welcome to letterboxing, I hope that it will prove to be as enjoyable to you<br/>
as it has to so many others before you. Everyone was new to letterboxing at<br/>
one time or another, and I am sure that everyone has had some assistance at<br/>
the start, so it is good to see new ones ask for help, and be shown the<br/>
ropes as you say. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am sure that there are letterboxers in your area, and hopefully some of<br/>
them will get a hold of you so that you may be able to make new friends in<br/>
your local letterboxing community. From time to time you will notice on this<br/>
list that there will be gathering announcements for fellow letterboxers. The<br/>
locations of these gatherings vary so I encourage you to keep your eyes open<br/>
and perhaps you will be able to find one close soon. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know that pandora and I truly love to go letterboxing with other people,<br/>
it ingrains in us the spirit of why we are out in the mighty timber to begin<br/>
with.  To enjoy the world around us, to value the simple things in life,<br/>
such as friends new and old friends alike, to accept the challenge whatever<br/>
that might be, and conquer it with what skills we have. And once we have<br/>
found our prize to leave it better than we had found it to begin with. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope that Saturday you are able to find some of your first letterboxes. I<br/>
also hope that you will be able to find some local boxers to go out with.<br/>
In the meantime you might find it helpful to ask questions about<br/>
letterboxing in general here on this list. I am sure it will prove helpful<br/>
to you. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I bid you well, and welcome once again. <br/>

  Thanks for the welcome.  I've been reading all that I can.  I even <br/>
tried to carve my own stamp, but it looked dumb when I got finished.  <br/>
I'm going to try again. I have lots of questions, but I think I'll <br/>
rummage through the site first and see if I can't find the answers.  <br/>
I'm hyped for Saturday.<br/>
