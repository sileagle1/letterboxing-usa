<br/>
The following is from an Ann Landers (or Dear Abby) column from the 70s:<br/>
<br/>
"A former neighbor once asked me, "doesn't it make you sad to know that <br/>
your dogs will live and die in your lifetime?"<br/>
<br/>
Of course it does. I can't imagine the grief I will feel when their lives<br/>
with us have ended. All we can hope is that they will live long, healthy<br/>
lives, unencumbered by debilitating illness. That they won't be taken from<br/>
us by an untimely accident. That they will die peacefully and painlessly.<br/>
And that we won't cry for too long.<br/>
<br/>
As painful as their loss will be, we will probably invite more dogs into <br/>
our lives, make them our companions, share our lives with them, and finally<br/>
mourn them as well. At the end of my life perhaps a dog will mourn for me. <br/>
I can think of no greater honor."<br/>
<br/>
Mourning your loss with you,<br/>
<br/>

I am so sorry to hear that you lost your Molly.  Our critters become <br/>
an integral part of our family, their loss is keenly felt, my sincere <br/>
condolences.  Treasure the memories you made together. <br/>

                 --Jim Willis<br/>
<br/>
You run in different fields now. Effortless. <br/>
You jump and play with wild abandon. Painless. <br/>
Eternally young and carefree. Timeless. <br/>
<br/>
There is a shroud over my heart. Darkness. <br/>
Days are longer and empty without you. Cheerless. <br/>
I still keep your pillow next to my bed. Sleepless. <br/>
<br/>
The years march on. Ceaseless. <br/>
The memories never wane. Impervious. <br/>
I feel the moment of my fading, then...Brightness. <br/>
<br/>
We run in different fields now. Effortless. <br/>
We jump and play with wild abandon. Painless. <br/>
Together for all eternity. Glorious. <br/>
