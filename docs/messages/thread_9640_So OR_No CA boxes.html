Knowing full well what they mean when they say, "all work and <br/>
no play...," I naturally included letterboxing as part of the itinerary. <br/>
The first night out, I pulled into the infamous Applegate Rest Area <br/>
in Southern Oregon to look for the box there. It was getting dark <br/>
and I had only completed the umpteenth compass heading in a <br/>
list as long as Michael Jackson's plastic  surgeon's bill when I <br/>
realized that taking bearings in total darkness is pretty much a <br/>
waste of time. So, I headed back to my room for the night where I <br/>
attempted to communicate with the ghost of Clark Gable.<br/>
<br/>
Since Clark was not being particularly talkative, I studied my map <br/>
instead and made an unfortunate discovery. Earlier in the day, I <br/>
had stamped the first of the three part Southern OR Covered <br/>
Bridges series into my book.  The clues to these boxes are not in <br/>
a North/South sequence and the Interstate is. The stamps need <br/>
to be printed one above the other.  I had the top one and was <br/>
now closest to the bottom one and many miles from the center <br/>
section. I could leave a blank in the center and try for the nearby <br/>
box. Hmmm...Having no idea if all three stamps were the same <br/>
dimensions, I decided that I would have to skip the closest box <br/>
and go for the center of the three. I would have had to drive 30 or <br/>
so miles back to snag the bottom... So my picture is incomplete <br/>
until the next  road trip.<br/>
<br/>
A few days later, I had actual work to do in Mt. Shasta, CA. Here it <br/>
was December but the termperature was in the 50s with a lapis <br/>
sky overhead. Finished with the money making portion of my day, <br/>
I headed for the Source of the Sacramento letterbox. Being so <br/>
close to the freeway and an easy walk, it has had quite a few <br/>
visitors. My own local contribution to letterboxing, the Mountain <br/>
View box, hasn't been nearly so lucky. It has had but one visitor! <br/>
Part of the problem may be that some bonehead decided to cut <br/>
down the "baby cedar" which was an important landmark in the <br/>
clue. Little did I know that this forest is open to Christmas tree <br/>
cutting. Joy to the world... The clue has been revised and has <br/>
been posted to the Talk List. <br/>
<br/>
Not being one to let the carving tools sit idle for too long, I left a <br/>
little mustelid in my wake for travelers along CA Highway 101. <br/>
Thanks to a those who did the same for me on my most recent <br/>
journey. Funhog<br/>
