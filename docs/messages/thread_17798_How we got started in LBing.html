They had a two sentence blurb about it. I think one sentence was, " <br/>
Letterboxing is geocaching for Luddites." I have not seen one local <br/>
stamp or letterbox in my area, but I am fortunate that some well <br/>
known boxers have left some here.<br/>
     I agree with Silver Eagle. The fact that letterboxing requires <br/>
some effort doesn't appeal to most casual participants. I have <br/>
wondered how many new letterboxers started after seeing what I saw in <br/>
Backpacker. That magazine has a huge circulation, but I don't think <br/>
it had much effect on letterboxing. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You know... I can't even remember when I first read about <br/>
letterboxing. It was few years ago...I want to say at least 3. I <br/>
remember reading the article, thinking "Cool." I think perhaps it <br/>
was an article in Rubberstampmadness, just a little blurb, but <br/>
enough to peak my interest. It seemed like a nice off shoot of <br/>
rubberstamp art and looked pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't start doing anything about it until last year. Why? I don't <br/>
know... I was in NYC for one, and didn't get out of the city much. <br/>
When I moved back to Maine I googled letterboxing and found all <br/>
sorts of good stuff and boxes locally (ish).<br/>
<br/>
Now I have created a monster, having introduced Camera <br/>
Obscura to the pasttime. He'll call me on occasion and gloat that <br/>
he is in Cape Cod or some other place and finding tons of <br/>
boxes. He's almost reached my number, which is low to be fair, <br/>
in F count in just a few months. <br/>
<br/>
So that's it. Since then I've introduced my sister and <br/>
brother-in-law and mom and gram and the somewhat reluctant <br/>
Brat, who actually prefers geocaching. She's 9. I have done my <br/>
best.<br/>
<br/>
Even my other sister, who is infinitely cooler than I, will readily <br/>
admit that "as far as goofy hobbies go, that one's pretty cool."<br/>

are too serious to have fun doing something as letterboxing.  One of my <br/>
fellow hikers are finding letterboxes with her grandson  and I did get someone to <br/>
check out letterboxing with her son.  I enjoy letterboxing but we have too few <br/>
on Long Island and the one I planted is gone.  It just disappeared no trace to <br/>
be found.<br/>
I have found some in Ct. ( letterboxing heaven) with my granddaughter  and I <br/>
have  found a HH and recieved one postal letterbox with one on its way.  I <br/>
still am too timid to try to carve  <br/>
my own stamp but I'm beginnning to feel guilty I don't  a home made stamp <br/>
yet.<br/>
So maybe this year I will carve my first stamp.<br/>

  As long as everyone else is telling how they got started I guess Ill chime in.  I heard about it on another yahoo list (for camp fire leaders).  I think it was probably a post from Camp Fire Lady.  I then have joined every list I could find<br/>
  about it...<br/>
  Unfortunately I havent been able to pursue it as much as I would like as I have try to do way too many things, and of course the lovely weather we are having. Hopefully Ill squeeze some in when the freezing weather in Colorado lets up a little.<br/>

<br/>
I am brand new to letterboxing! As a matter of fact - I haven't even <br/>
looked for one yet! My husband, daughter (13) and I are planning our <br/>
first letterboxing outing for this coming Saturday. (In South Jersey, <br/>
the weather is supposed to be mild, so we're taking advantage of it <br/>
to get started!) We have logbooks, compass and are getting our <br/>
personal stamps finished and can't wait to hit the trail!<br/>
<br/>
We stumbled onto letterboxing in an interesting way. In the fall, my <br/>
husband, Eric, and I spent a weekend hiking in the Catskills. We had <br/>
a fantastic hike to Kaaterskill Falls and when we got home, wanting <br/>
to find more information about the local lore of this neat site, we <br/>
started searching on the Web. One of the most interesting links we <br/>
stumbled upon was the clue page for the Kaaterskill Falls letterbox. <br/>
We were so excited to see that we had been only feet away from a very <br/>
neat secret! We found out more about letterboxing and determined that <br/>
after the holidays and when weather became a little less cold, we <br/>
would give it a try. <br/>
<br/>
Strangely enough, two weeks ago, I was browsing my local bookstore <br/>
and came across a new book on letterboxing "The Letterboxer's <br/>
Companion", so I picked it up and we immediately started preparing <br/>
for our first search. We're hoping to be able to find a couple on our <br/>
first outing, there seem to be several opportunities nearby. We're <br/>
also starting out with easy ones, to get a feel for the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
As a special treat, we do plan to return to Kaaterskill Falls in the <br/>
spring to get what we did not leave with last time!<br/>
<br/>
We'd be glad to receive any advice to beginning letterboxers, <br/>
although, it certainly seems the nature of this hobby is finding out <br/>
things little by little on your own.<br/>
<br/>
Very excited to get started,<br/>
Monica<br/>

<br/>
I had gotten an email from a gentleman (Kris) who said he was a <br/>
soldier in Iraq who wanted to know whether I could possibly get him <br/>
a donated Pocket PC handheld computer.  (My name is listed on <br/>
several websites as a user group leader for Pocket PC.)<br/>
<br/>
My "scam radar" went up immediately.  I thought, "Yeah, right.  I'm <br/>
just going to send a $300-$500 item to some Bozo who claims he's a <br/>
soldier."  If I had one, that is...<br/>
<br/>
And so I went to Google to seach the man's name.  I found his name <br/>
on several sites about letterboxing! Which led me to wonder what in <br/>
the world letterboxing is. Which led me to letterboxing.org.  Which <br/>
led me to carve my sig stamp within 48 hours.  And plant my first <br/>
box within a couple of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Kris, of course, is legit.  Many of you know him.  If I'm not <br/>
mistaken, he's even a native of Louisiana - where I am.  <br/>
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to help him obtain a used Pocket PC - I <br/>
sure hope someone was able to.<br/>
<br/>
Kris, thanks so much for inadvertently clueing me in to <br/>
letterboxing!  Thanks for your service to our country.  And I'm <br/>
sorry I couldn't help you get a Pocket PC.<br/>

I'd hike.  To my suprise I find a clue sheet for a hidden treasure on <br/>
one of the trails.  Why couldn't I had found this before I went on my <br/>

clicking the link to LBNA I discover there's none in LA or MS and I <br/>
would have to do something about that.  After hiding 3 or 4,<br/>
