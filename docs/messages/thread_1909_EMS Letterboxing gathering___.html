                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey folks!<br/>
Just to let you all know that the Eastern Mountain Sports store of Waterford<br/>
will be hosting a letterboxing hike/gathering on Saturday Feb 17th, 2001.<br/>
Yes, that's this coming saturday, sorry for the short notice. However, we'll<br/>
be meeting at Bluff Point Coastal Reserve in Groton, CT and will be placing<br/>
at least one letterbox and searching for one or more of the eight boxes in<br/>
the area of that park. We'll be meeting at 10am at the information board<br/>
near the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
To get there:<br/>
Off of route 95,<br/>
			take exit 88 for route 117... head south toward<br/>
groton<br/>
			when you come to the lighted t-intersection, turn<br/>
right<br/>
			when you see dairy queen on the right there will be<br/>
a road 				to the left... head down it. you will come<br/>
to a stop 			sign (new) go straight until you come to a<br/>
small sign in 			front of you pointing out bluff point and<br/>
follow the road 			under the railroad tracks down the<br/>
VERY BUMPY dirt road 			and into the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Please dress for the weather. Remember in cold weather, you can dehydrate<br/>
quicker (as I found out hiking the Blue Hills Reservation near Boston, good<br/>
boxes though). Also, bring a snack or lunch. We will be out for a couple or<br/>
few hours... depends on how creative we will be in placing our box! We will<br/>
provide the box materials and the stamp. Hope to see a bunch of you there!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This sounds great, Eric.  Whether we can make it kinda depends on the <br/>
weather and if we are under it....that is, we LB with a 4-year-old, <br/>
and we've all had colds lately.<br/>

Hope to see you,<br/>
