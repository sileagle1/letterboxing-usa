and you can follow our foot prints in the snow right to the boxes even<br/>
though we tried like the devil to make lots of other false tracks. Any<br/>
letter boxer would know just what we were doing ?. Had fun in the 6 0r 8<br/>
inches  of 'new ' snow as there is none at the shore where I live.  We<br/>
were first to stamp in and I was so surprised that I think I only signed<br/>
my name !  There are so many of us 'new' winter boxers, as last year we<br/>
hardly even saw snow. It is a whole new wonderful world out there. Enjoy<br/>
and have a butterfly day.<br/>
