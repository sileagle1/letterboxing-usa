<br/>
Things have been so quiet of late around this state that I'm <br/>
starting to wonder if there are only 4 or 5 of us still out there in <br/>
this great state.  I see dozens of new &amp; recent signature stamps in <br/>
area letterboxes from the Columbia River all the way to the northern <br/>
Seattle letterboxes but haven't heard a peep from most of you.  <br/>

Letterboxing that you're welcome to join--search Yahoo Groups for <br/>

<br/>
**Plan on attending some sort of letterboxing gathering in the Puget <br/>
Sound region in the next couple of months (probably November'ish).  <br/>
We'll come up with a central location that will allow for folks from <br/>
all around the area to attend.<br/>
<br/>
**Also, there are several Washington &amp; Pacific Northwest themed <br/>
letterboxing websites out there.  You can find links to them at <br/>
either my website, Mischief's or Team Rayvenhaus' new site and via <br/>
many others I can't recall at the moment.  Remember finding clues to <br/>
some letterboxes are challenges in themselves!!!<br/>

Hope to hear from you soon or to meet you along the letterboxing <br/>
trails someday!<br/>

Let me add a little to this as well dvn2rckr.<br/>
<br/>
The PNWLb website, is just that. A website that is dedicated to letterboxing<br/>
in the Pacific Northwest. It is not just a personal website, oh no!  (grin)<br/>
It's so much more.  We've got forums to post in, we've got a letterbox DB to<br/>
drop clues into, we've got FAQ's and Tips and Tricks, Oh! My!<br/>
<br/>
It's just a place that offers an alternative to the main LbNA site to post<br/>
your letterbox clues on.  It's not meant to replace the main site in any<br/>
way, just to offer a gathering place for the PNW.<br/>
<br/>
And, although I do host it, code it and maintain it, it's not mine.  Oh, no.<br/>
It's yours.  If it was mine, then it wouldn't get very far at all. It's very<br/>
dynamic, since I maintain the codebase.  You want a change, let me know and<br/>
if it's feasible and it's not something that's already been tried and<br/>
removed by the users, I'll make it happen.<br/>
<br/>
Come on over, take a look, I think you'll like what you see......<br/>
<br/>
And who knows...... If enough people from another state want to be included,<br/>
like say, California, I may just add that state into the Database.<br/>
