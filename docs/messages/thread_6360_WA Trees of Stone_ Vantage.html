stamp in on this great site with a pretty (if not ooopish) stamp<br/>
<br/>
The hike IS a hefty three miles. If you start thinking you went the <br/>
wrong way on the clues keep going it is a long way up over the top.<br/>
<br/>
It was a sunny hot Eastern Washington day.  There is a constant <br/>
breeze though so it is tollerable.  Water is a MUST.  The view from <br/>
the box, excellent!<br/>
<br/>
Eliza, I have concerns that the particular box is not holding up in <br/>
the heat.  The plastic feels somewhat mushy.  I am not familiar with <br/>
they type of box you used and what its original state should be.<br/>

Finally catching up on some email -- sorry this is so late.<br/>
<br/>
I've been using one of two kinds of boxes -- either the mooshy plastic <br/>
ones like that one is (which I thought would just get mooshier and not <br/>
melt completely since it's supposed to be microwave safe, too :&gt;), or <br/>
those gladware things that I'm a little concerned with water safety <br/>
about, but we'll see.  I'm planning another quick jaunt out to that side <br/>
of the mountains one of these days soon (I've got a Northern Exposure <br/>
series for Roslyn! Heehee!), and I'll check on it, then. :)<br/>

Thanks for the update!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi guys--<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought about finding solid (yet cheap) LB containers in the <br/>
Pacific Northwest.  I stopped by Bargain World and Value Village the <br/>
other day and found a smorgasbord of very sturdy plasticware (like <br/>
Rubbermade or Tupperware or other freezer ware type stuff) that <br/>
seemed perfect for letterboxes.  The bonus was that the containers <br/>
were normally 59 cents but on sale for 75% off--so for the grand <br/>
total of 15 cents each I came away with several awesome sturdy <br/>
containers worthy of letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps a bit!<br/>

PS  Can't wait for the Roslyn series.  I just placed one in the <br/>
Olympics Natl Park during a recent camping/letterboxing trip.  <br/>
Perhaps that park is worthy of a full series?  ;)<br/>
