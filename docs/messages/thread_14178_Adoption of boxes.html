Certainly in states like mine and Oregon when there is a bounty of <br/>
boxes, the loss of boxes might not be felt, but in other areas, the <br/>
loss of boxes might be keenly felt.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry that Der Mad Stamper appears to have dropped from sight.  <br/>
He is legend here and you start to feel concern for someone whom you <br/>
have never met.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that it is easy enough to transfer a box to my e mail <br/>
and I can edit in a "status report" when it is checked on.<br/>
<br/>
DVN2R SKR will be moving soon to parts unknown.  We will all <br/>
certainly keep an eye on her boxes if she askes us to . Well shoot <br/>
even if she does not ask.  One of her boxes seems to be every two <br/>
miles around here :-D.  It is easy enough to carry some extra baggies <br/>
and take note of a happy or unhappy box.<br/>
