<div>A question for those who enjoy hiding their 
boxes using a compass. Does any one take into consideration the deviation 
of magnetic north for their given area, or does everyone just set the compass 
for true north and then go for it??  The Six layers of history LB in WV, in 
note 2 states "all bearings magnet unless other wise noted" What other kinds of 
bearings would there be? I have done a bit of orienteering and Boy Scout hiking 
with compass, so I am just trying to see if letterboxers are on the same wave 
length and so I don't assume.</div>

&gt; The Six layers of history LB in WV, in note 2 states "all bearings<br/>
&gt; magnet unless other wise noted" What other kinds of bearings would there be?<br/>
<br/>
True bearings and grid bearings.  <br/>
<br/>
Magnetic bearings are the easiest, and (at least for my boxes) basically <br/>
mean dial the stated bearing into the compass and go (yes I realise these<br/>
can change over time, but what are you going to do about it?).  If the <br/>
clue is using a true or grid bearing then you will have to determine the <br/>
local correction and do the math (there is a web site that will do this<br/>
for you).<br/>
<br/>
As for all letterboxers being on the same wavelength, there are some clues<br/>
I know that use true bearings, but most use magnetic.  There is no one<br/>
wavelength though, each clue writer is free to do what they want (I have<br/>
one clue that uses both magnetic and another type of bearing, for example).<br/>
Hopefully the clue writer will tell you the sort of bearing they are using,<br/>
if not, I have never had any problem assuming magnetic.  (I also note that<br/>
letterboxers are not on the same wavelength as to what a pace is; hopefully<br/>
they will tell you in their clue or give a pace calibration leg).<br/>
<br/>
Also, bear in mind that declination is usually 15 degrees or less, so <br/>
it usually in practice doesn't matter much for the sorts of clues that<br/>
are out there currently (although there are a handful of exceptions).  <br/>
Generally you are looking for a given feature in the given direction, and <br/>
if not, you are looking at doing grid and search anyway.<br/>

Jay, I have often wondered about this myself.  Most times I find it<br/>
doesn't really matter that much (find the tree, rock, etc at xx degrees,<br/>
and there is one of those within 20 degrees of that point.   The only<br/>
time that it was a little difficult for the Tribal Nation letterbox but<br/>
the other clues helped.<br/>
<br/>
Take Care,<br/>
Rick<br/>
