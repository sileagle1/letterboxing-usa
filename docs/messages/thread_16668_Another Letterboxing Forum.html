<br/>
I'm sorry I offended anyone, I posted this as a hopefully friendly solution to a on going problem. My post was to let letterboxers know there are other letterboxing forum's out there and if your not happy with this one, seek another. I'm not even the webmaster of the  questioned forum, just a member, like I'm a member of this one. I never gave the LBNA logo patch on the site any thought when I joined, I just enjoy letterboxing and hope to correspond with like people. As for writing me off list and meeting with some sarcasm and reluctance, you most have been corresponding with someone else. I was never written too and I would never reply to anyone in a sarcastic manner. I'm just a outdoorsman that truly loves nature and I treat everyone with respect and the dignity they deserve. <br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails<br/>
