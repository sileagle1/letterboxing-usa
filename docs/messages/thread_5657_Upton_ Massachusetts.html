                    <html><body><div>Hello there eveyone!  At the bottom of the clues for The Forever Friends Letterboxes (4) for Upton, Massachusetts you ask that we e-mail you and let you know our thoughts.  We wanted to let you know that this has been a fun new experience for us and our dog.  We have been to the Gloucester Lighthouse and to two of the first in the series of 4 in Upton.  </div> <div> </div> <div>It was great.  I like Lonewolf's stamp.  The clues are easy to read and follow and it gives us someting to do while we run the dog.  However, we have discovered that we need to contact the parks before we leave.  We attempted to find one in New Hampshire and were turned away because we had our four legged friend with us.  </div> <div> </div> <div>We are in the process of making a box for Boxford Forest in Massachusetts and will post our clues soon.  We are also going to California at the end of the month and plan to leave a box behind with self addressed stamped postcards, as we will not return to California for approximately one year time ourselves.  </div> <div> </div> <div>I am glad that I read the article in the airplane magazine and found your web-site.  We will spread the news.   This weekend we plan on finishing the last two box's in Upton and we are bringing a cousin along who's interest has been raised.  We will keep you posted!!!! thanks...<br/><br/></div></body></html>

Since I just posted info on my Ennisbrook boxes, I'll add that they <br/>
are indeed on a fido-friendly trail.  They're also on the opposite <br/>
side of the continent from you, unfortunately...<br/>
