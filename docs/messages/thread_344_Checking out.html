<br/>
I recently joined this list after being contacted by a friend on this <br/>
list with whom I had not corresponded in several months. I mentioned that <br/>
I had considered signing up on this list, but was not sure if it was a <br/>
good idea given past disagreements between Dan and myself. From the <br/>
response I received, it was my impression that I was welcome as long I as <br/>
I was actively involved in letterboxing activities. <br/>
<br/>
However, Dan has made it clear to me that as long as I am still going <br/>
"the commercial route with letterboxing" I would not fit in here. That is <br/>
fine, and I hold no animosity. I had hoped to somehow mend some old <br/>
issues, and establish some loose degree of cooperation amongst different <br/>
sites, lists, etc. That is obviously not going to happen, and I think it <br/>
is sad and unfortunate. Consequently, I am signing off after this message <br/>
and won't again attempt to establish any relationship with "Letterboxing <br/>
USA" activities per se. However, I again openly extend an invitation to <br/>
any individuals who wish to be involved with International Letterboxing <br/>
Club, regardless of their involvement in any other letteboxing site, <br/>
list, activities etc. I would ask this one favor. Quite a number of you <br/>
are also subscribers to letterboxing-talk. If individually any of you <br/>
really feel strongly that it is wrong for me to openly state that I <br/>
intend to try to support ILC (to become the best letterboxing resource I <br/>
can make it) with advertising or other commercial revenue, please <br/>
unsubscribe from the letterboxing-talk list provided by ILC. I will post <br/>
more details on this issue to the letterboxing-talk list.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, best wishes again to all, and I will hopefully correspond with <br/>
many of you on the letterboxing-talk list in the future. Bye.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
<br/>
