                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was hard to believe that it was time to hit the road again.  We had just <br/>
gotten back from Wintergreen and these old bodies had yet to recover -- no <br/>
sleep (hard mattresses) and digestive ills (weak plumbing -- and, as firm <br/>
believers in the "leave no trace" policy... enough said)...<br/>
<br/>
Some how Da and I repacked the suitcases, loaded a bag full of snacks and <br/>
drinks (forgot the paper towels again!) printed out the appropriate clues, <br/>
carted pup back off to the kennel and and set off north.<br/>
<br/>
Miss Ma was the only one who had truly prepared for this visit to the NY <br/>
area.  She had her art supply kit, favorite stuffed animal traveling <br/>
partners and the new Lizzie McGuire movie to pop in the TV.  But, most <br/>
tellingly, over the past week she had managed to add the phrase "oooooh my <br/>
gawd!!" to her hourly lexicon with the correct inflection and everything!  <br/>
This is not a phrase we use a lot at home (except when discussing the latest <br/>
reveal on Trading Spaces...) so we don't know where she got it from.  None <br/>
of the other powerful influences on her life (Sponge Bob, Squidworth, etc.) <br/>
could be blamed.  But it sure made her sound like she was ready to take NYC <br/>
(or at least Long Island) by storm!<br/>
<br/>
The newly acquired Lizzie McGuire movie lasted just as long as the <br/>
construction traffic around the beltway leaving four more hours to fill...  <br/>
Mom and Dad survived the drive and the kids managed to survive despite the <br/>
fact that they got an old Happy Meal toy at the Burger King on the Jersey <br/>
Turnpike (surprised?!)   Though not without begging the cashier to exchange <br/>
it for something  more au courant "Ooooh my Gawwwwwd -- we HAVE this one <br/>
already!"...<br/>
<br/>
The next day Grandpa accompanied us to our favorite park in NJ.  Not only is <br/>
it a complete blast -- but, since last visit -- it had become the site for <br/>
three new mystery boxes!!!  Yipppeeeee!<br/>
<br/>
Now, we have seen via recent posts, that one needs to be especially careful <br/>
discussing anything to do with mystery boxes.  So, as not to give anything <br/>
away, let it suffice to say that the [sic] was fantastic and we saw so many <br/>
wonderful [sic], not to mention the special visiting [sic] exhibit which was <br/>
just perfect for Miss Ma and her love of colors!!  Many of the [sic] were <br/>
much bigger than we had imagined them to be in real life, but isn't that <br/>
often the case?!  We had a great time going all over [sic] collecting the <br/>
info needed to complete the mystery box clues - what a great idea!  Make <br/>
sure you pay special attention to the last whistle sign on the [sic] cause <br/>
it comes sooner than you think.<br/>
<br/>
Although we were having a great deal of fun on part one of the boxing <br/>
venture, the day was hot and Grandpa was fading fast.  So we did what BeMa <br/>
does best and looked for the nearest dispenser of all things frozen dairy.  <br/>
We ate in the shade and passed a pleasant half hour quietly disparaging the <br/>
outfits of all the passersby (come on -- you do it too!... And, as long as <br/>
they don't hear you -- what the harm?  It's just like yelling at the TV or <br/>
at the other drivers on the road -- with the windows up and carefully <br/>
avoiding those with gun racks.  Of course, noticing some of the select <br/>
vocabulary words my children have learned strapped in their car seats <br/>
tooling around town with me, that might not be the best idea....)  Anyway, <br/>
grandpa was having a particularly good time pointing out this poor woman who <br/>
was dressed head to toe in black pants and a black long sleeved shirt "In <br/>
this heat, what is she?  crazy?!" (let me not fail to mention at this point, <br/>
that Grandpa himself, though we love him dearly, was, himself, dressed wrist <br/>
to ankle in dark blue....)<br/>
<br/>
Thinking that everyone had gotten their second wind, Da and I whipped out <br/>
the compass and proceeded to try and follow all the clues we had gathered on <br/>
the [sic], at the [sic] and watching Be and Ma go round and round on the <br/>
[sic].  Much to our chagrin -- the clues weren't making sense.  Always a big <br/>
danger sign!  We tried going into one patch of woods and then another with <br/>
no luck.  The ice cream had started to wear off and the complaining began so <br/>
we headed back to Grandma and Grandpa's house for a dip in the condo pool to <br/>
regroup.<br/>
<br/>
On this trip, we had come to realize several things about visiting aging <br/>
parents.  Firstly, really nice seniorish condo community pool regulars do <br/>
not relish when other people's grandchildren canonball into the water, have <br/>
repeated splash fights and shriek (usually -- but not always -- with <br/>
delight).  I think Grandma and Grandpa will be spending the rest of the <br/>
summer indoors...<br/>
<br/>
So as to try and not notice the scowls on the faces of those other grandmas <br/>
I began a study of their feet.  Those ladies have really nice toes!  Forget <br/>
the blue hair -- I want the great pedicures!!  Is that part of the deal of <br/>
getting older?  Maybe once the college educations are paid for...  <br/>
Personally, I'm lucky if I get to redo my own pedicure -- myself -- before <br/>
the color from the last one has completely chipped off or grown to migrate <br/>
off the end of the nail itself -- leaving me with a stripe of red right at <br/>
the end -- and, wouldn't you know it -- red isn't even the hot color anymore <br/>
-- pink is!  The tweens and the generation X'ers know it and the grannies do <br/>
too.   Oooooh my gawd where have I been?!...<br/>
<br/>
The second thing we learned about visiting aging parents is the rule that <br/>
the thermostat of the house must apparently be set to the age of the most <br/>
senior occupant of the residence (roughly 77 degrees!)  (This rule is not to <br/>
be confused with the similar rule concerning the volume of the TV...)<br/>
<br/>
Between hurried walks down to the shallow end of the pool to hush the <br/>
kiddies, Da and I realized that the clues weren't working because we <br/>
probably had the wrong starting point.  Darned if that doesn't just put a <br/>
kink in the whole search!!<br/>
<br/>
Grandma and Grandpa had generously offered to baby-sit for the kids while Da <br/>
and I went out for a romantic dinner -just the two of us -- alone -- with no <br/>
chicken nuggets...  So, we decided that now that we knew the correct <br/>
starting point -- we would run back to [sic] and locate the three mystery <br/>
boxes.  Then, flush with our success, we would dine.<br/>
<br/>
To be continued in Part Two entitled "Where was BeMa When the Lights Went <br/>
Out?!..."<br/>
