I know exactly how you feel! <br/>
My 16 year old has carved our stamps so far and his are great (although<br/>
our first box stamp has a "backwards" treble clef motif ;-)!!!), and my<br/>
oldest son carved an exquisite woodpecker stamp for his girlfriend - so<br/>
I was pretty intimidated...<br/>
Yesterday I actually had a few hours free time and decided to try it for<br/>
myself - I had a hitchhiker stamp in mind that I needed FAST and there<br/>
was no one else to carve it!<br/>
Okay - it's not very good and I almost feel I should add an apology to<br/>
the hitchhiker...but it was terrific fun and very addicting. I learned<br/>
so much that I'm dying to try another one!<br/>
Biggest lesson: My 16 year old came home and gently pointed out that the<br/>
reason I couldn't get that special speedball nib to work is that I was<br/>
holding it upside down...;-)<br/>
