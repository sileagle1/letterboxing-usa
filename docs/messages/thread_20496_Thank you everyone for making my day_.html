                    <div class="plaintext-content">I saw this bit about Bob Weasely (er, Heasely!) on accident this <br/>
morning, since I almost never read all of a digest on a weekend (not <br/>
when I could be letterboxing!). I also thought I was misreading and <br/>
read it again and again, with a huge sinking feeling. I AM African <br/>
American and I happen to enjoy letterboxing, but this suddenly <br/>
tainted my whole world, as do ALL the reminders of racial hatred that <br/>
pop up just when I'm finding a place of full tolerance. We've been at <br/>
parties where someone has said something like this and I had to sit <br/>
there clutching my husband's hand in a death grip to keep him seated <br/>
while trying to politely scold the speaker and NOT ruin everyone's <br/>
good time. It's awful to feel like my reaction is watched by the <br/>
world and even worse to watch my husband, a Caucasian male, have to <br/>
suffer with me because HIS anger won't help either (he gets <br/>
the "well, of COURSE it makes YOU mad...your WIFE'S black" comments).<br/>
<br/>
I was ready to call him in to show him this atrocity, to sit and try <br/>
to understand how you can be ignorant and still have a computer, how <br/>
you can get into a group meant for happy things and still be a <br/>
racist, how you could be so BLIND in your racism to not know enough <br/>
to at LEAST keep comments like that to yourself, that you could <br/>
actually be so backward as to think that there wouldn't be ONE person <br/>
of color reading (or that you wouldn't CARE)...and then I read all <br/>
the subsequent posts. <br/>
<br/>
Folks, I don't know if you've ever been in a bad situation in school <br/>
with a bully teasing you and all your friends no where in sight, but <br/>
if you have, then you can remember that feeling when the teacher <br/>
showed up or a stranger stepped in and said, "Hey, why don't you just <br/>
leave her/him alone, man?" Not only did one person step in, but a TON <br/>
of people! I don't know if you're all white or black (or <br/>
fuschia/blueberry/grape!), but the fact that you SPOKE UP and STOPPED <br/>
him so that he KNEW he'd done wrong (the way you have to with all <br/>
bullies) was enough to bring me to tears. I don't think ANYONE <br/>
besides my husband has ever really come to my rescue in such a <br/>
case...they've always been too embarrassed to do more than half <br/>
chuckle and say, "Oh, that's bad...don't say that" but NEVER have I <br/>
seen outrage. I felt ashamed for ever having thought that I'd have to <br/>
quit this hobby. <br/>
<br/>
If any of you ever comes out Western NY way, be sure to get a hug <br/>
from this sprite, whose wings you all brought the breeze back under!<br/>
May all your boxes be FFs with brand new hitchhikers in them and <br/>
handmade stamps so well thought out that they bring you to <br/>
tears...you're all the best!  :-) <br/>

Man, that fuschia/blueberry/grape thing really cracked me up!  I <br/>
would have stepped in to say something too...but I kept reading what <br/>
he wrote over and over again trying to figure out what the heck he <br/>
was saying.  I may be naive, but I don't even understand where he <br/>
was going...???  Once people started calling racism, I read it a few <br/>
more times, thinking "what the heck?!?" <br/>
Anyhow, I'm glad he's gone...I didn't realize he was the "stealing <br/>
the OH Lb" guy too.  Good riddance. :P<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Especially to Sprite-- I'm sorry I didn't see your post earlier, right after it was written.  I've been traveling every weekend in Sept. (one of the gatherings having been a very wonderful, COLORful women's retreat in NC) and still have over 300 posts to catch up on. I'm so glad I didn't just delete them, as I'd have missed this one. Thank you for expressing yourself, all of the emotions you went through, because it helps me (and I hope others too) to get the courage I need sometimes to go with my intuition and stick my neck out to speak out against ugliness the way I should. It made ME cry to hear that you so rarely have had people confront these racist issues head-on.  I had read with horror the Heasley-Weasley post, and the quick shut-down thanks to Mark, and others' disgust over the original.  I couldn't believe that guy called himself "Mensan" Bob.  Mensan my foot!   <br/>
<br/>
I have spoken out in many ways, but in 11 years of living in an average-sized, mostly decent town and having tenants &amp; workmates of many colors, I have seen a real eyeful when it comes to racial issues.  I'm sorry to say that every one of the bad experiences except one, had to do with policemen who made wrong assumptions due to their own racism.  I've heard too many first-hand stories from my tenants and workmates which made my hair bristle--things that took place within blocks of my house or on my street.  Even though I was not present, I wish now that I had written letters to the police dept. and/or gone to speak with the officers who made offensive assumptions.  I wrote quite a few letters in my head, but never got around to really writing and sending them.  Not out of fear, just out of plain negligence.  After reading your post, I realize it's partly negligence like mine that allows that kind of ugliness to still have a grip in our society. So thank you again, Sprite, for the encouragement we need to remind eachother that it matters, every little bit. Rather than bemoan what I haven't done, I plan to get to work and find out whether these things are still going on (we have a new chief of police &amp; I hope it has helped, but don't know) and will not allow myself to neglect things like this again because I won't be able to stand the regret.  Thanks again for the (gentle) kick in the pants!  If anyone wants to know the particular stories, email me privately &amp; I'll tell you.  I don't want to get flamed here for going on about non-letterboxing.   --lunaryakketyact<br/>
