It's my understanding that the pigment-based are a slow-drying ink <br/>

invaluable here in Oregon.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As a rubber stamp artist myself, I can tell you that there is a vast <br/>
difference between dye and pigment inks.  Dye inks will absorb into <br/>
the paper and pigments sit on top of the paper.  Pigments take <br/>
longer to dry - most need to be heat set in order to dry <br/>
sufficiently.  They are used for embossing and other artsy <br/>
techniques.  Dye are water-based, but some are permanent.  Permanent <br/>
pads that I would recommend are these two brand: Memories and <br/>
Ancient Page.  Both are waterproof, permanent and archival (acid <br/>
free).  DO NOT buy anything that is alcohol based or solvent based <br/>
as this will corrode the rubber.  Always clean your stamp when you <br/>
get home (whether it is store bought or hand carved).  I find the <br/>
best cleaner is alcohol-free baby wipes!  Dye based permanent inks <br/>
will always leave a little color on your stamp, but it won't <br/>
interfere with changing colors. <br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a couple of notes about ink pads.  A "child safe, washable ink pad"<br/>
would not have food coloring in it.  Have you ever tried to get Kool-Aid off<br/>
your floor or counter when a child has spilled it?  That stuff stains<br/>
severely!   No ink is totally washable.  Some wash off easier than others<br/>
but most will stain clothing and very dry skin (which just sucks the ink<br/>
in).<br/>
<br/>
Pigment ink is indeed sometimes used for embossing but that is not it's only<br/>
purpose.  Most archival water resistant inks are pigment inks.  They do dry<br/>
slowly but once dry are pretty permanent and do not bleed under damp<br/>
conditions.  And there are also companies producing quick drying pigment<br/>
ink.  Pigment inks tend to have the most intense color.  I also, in my neck<br/>
of the woods, am able to find tiny "cat's eye" style pads in pigment ink but<br/>
haven't found anything similar around here in dye based ink.<br/>
<br/>
Some companies are now making water resistant dye ink pads.  Many of the<br/>
brands of dye ink pads on the market are not at all water resistant,  but<br/>
they do dry more quickly.<br/>
<br/>
There are also solvent based inks on the market that I have not yet tried.<br/>
Some are alcohol based.  They dry very quickly through evaporation.<br/>
<br/>
I am still making up my mind about which I prefer.  If stamping in with<br/>
pigment ink it would probably be wise to insert a little piece of tissue<br/>
paper to absorb any ink that doesn't dry before you close the log book.<br/>
Maybe a too much of a pain in the neck.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that if people are truly concerned about the type of ink<br/>
they are using in their log books and boxes that they read labels and talk<br/>
with a knowledgeable sales person in a rubber stamping or scrapbooking<br/>
store.  Ask all kinds of questions to be sure you are getting the kind of<br/>
ink you want.  I think we are all looking for different things so no one ink<br/>
will work for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this long response is somewhat helpful.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. If an ink pad is too dry to use you should take it back to the store.<br/>
It is a good idea to buy a reinker for your pad when you buy it - saves<br/>
money in the long run.  Also,  store your ink pads upside down and gravity<br/>
will keep the ink on the surface of the pad.<br/>

I'll just add, that I prefer pigmant inks when using hand carved stamps.  <br/>
Pigmant inks (in my experience) are more forgiving and give a nice image <br/>
more consistantly (with hand carved stamps).<br/>
