<br/>
My wife and I on our first letterboxing experience went to look for the two<br/>
boxes on Belle Isle in Richmond, VA.  We found the first one left by the<br/>
Morgan family with little trouble.  The second one (left by Phillip and<br/>
Lydia), which starts near the first one, we looked for for over an hour and<br/>
never found.  We don't think it was missing we just couldn't follow the<br/>
directions to what seemd the right location.<br/>
<br/>
The last couple directions refer to continuing straight 180 degrees at a<br/>
four way intersection and then looking for three concrete blocks and we<br/>
never really found a 4-way intersection and certainly not the concrete<br/>
blocks.  My wife and I would just like to know if this box has been found by<br/>
others.  If it has then it must be an error on our part and we'll try again.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Shawn<br/>
