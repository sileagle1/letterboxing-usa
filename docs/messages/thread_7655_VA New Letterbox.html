<br/>
The Bee's Knees Letterbox. Planted 9/12/02 by Waterbird.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From I-495, take exit 44 west on Rte. 193 4.6 miles to <br/>
a right on River Bend Rd. Go 2.1 miles on River Bend Rd. to a <br/>
right on Jeffery Rd. Go past the first entrance (to the Visitors <br/>
Center) at 0.9 miles and press on to the entrance to the Nature <br/>
Center. Note: The Nature Center building is closed except for <br/>
special events. Park in the lot and follow the signs to the Center. <br/>
Then follow the signs to the Paw-Paw Trail. Take the trail down <br/>
the hill, across the footbridge and along the boardwalk. Keep <br/>
going until you come to an junction with a service road. Turn right <br/>
here and follow the road/trail up a rise and down a hill to a pond <br/>
on the left. It is about a 7-minute walk from the junction to the <br/>
pond. Leaving the road/trail, follow the narrow footpath that goes <br/>
around the pond, bearing always to the left (don't follow the <br/>
watercourse that leads straight up the hill). Keep on this small <br/>
path around the pond, passing a log that has fallen across the <br/>
trail. You will be on a heading of about 222 degrees. Near the <br/>
end of the pond, you will find a second fallen tree across the <br/>
path, this one with a notch cut in it -- presumably to make <br/>
passage by small fry easier. Don't cross this tree; instead, go to <br/>
the right up the slope and look behind the tree's roots. Bee's <br/>
Knees is hidden under some leaves and sticks.<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: A nice walk, but there is that uphill going back, if you <br/>
have small children. There's only one portajohn at the Nature <br/>
Center, and the building is closed, so if you do have small <br/>
children with you, you might want to stop first at the Visitors <br/>
Center, which has many portables but nice bathrooms as well.<br/>
