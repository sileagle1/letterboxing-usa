The Weekend Crafter: Rubber Stamp Carving: Techniques, Designs &amp;<br/>
Projects by Luann Udell<br/>
Also I liked :<br/>
Art Stamping Workshop by Gloria Page.<br/>
There are lots of tips in both of those.<br/>
Also, I use speedball #1 blades mostly but beware because you can buy<br/>
them new and they often start out dull :( <br/>
So I use a very fine grit sandpaper and sharpen them. <br/>
Also check your carving medium.<br/>
Don't use the white stuff that Speedball makes! It is terrible and<br/>
won't last long in a letterbox. Nasty crumbly stuff.....<br/>
The pink stuff is fine.<br/>
As to the others many folks seem like different ones, so shop around.<br/>
Choices: PZkut, Dick Blick's grey rubber stuff, Mastercarve, Staedler<br/>
erasers, pink pearl erasers.<br/>
I am sure that I have forgotten some here.<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

A couple things that have helped me somewhat are:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Finding a mentor to show you  how to carve  I am very privileged to have<br/>
ScoutDog nearby and  have been able to watch her carve.  She does a<br/>
fantastic demonstration that  helped me with some very basic techniques.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion is to make sure your tools are SHARP.  Carving tools are<br/>
the same as knives in that respect.  Work much better when sharp.<br/>

talented carvers and others at least enjoy it.  But for many this<br/>
hobby is about the hunting and finding not the art.<br/>
So, feel free to use store bought stamps.  Personally I enjoy the hand<br/>
carved stamps but that's not really why I search for the boxes so I<br/>
don't care one way or the other.  <br/>
<br/>
I know some, who've been at this for quite a while, have never carved<br/>
their own stamps, others carve for them or they buy them.  I believe<br/>
in England most all the stamps are bought.<br/>

those who are VERY disappointed when finding them. There are those who<br/>
will not even bother to look if they know the box has such a stamp<br/>

<br/>
The general concensus amongst those who feel this way is that the<br/>
crudest handmade stamp is far better than one made by a machine. If<br/>
you want to maximize the number of folks interested in finding your<br/>
letterboxes, I recommend carving your own stamps. <br/>
<br/>
As for the tools you choose to use, you need to practice, practice,<br/>
practice. That is the only way you will learn which is right for you.<br/>
Some superior carvers use the Speedball gouges and others various<br/>
types of blades or a combination of both. There is no way to know<br/>
which is best for you without just trying. Well prepared art,<br/>
magnification and good light will go a long way to improving your<br/>
results. When cutting curves, rotate the carving medium not your hand.<br/>
Both letterboxing.org and Atlas Quest have carving tutorials that are<br/>
very helpful. Good luck! Funhog <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with CompassPoints regarding store bought stamps - nothing<br/>
wrong with them. But some folks get a little disappointed if they are<br/>
expecting a carved stamp and find a store bought one instead. A note<br/>
in the clues page about what type of stamp is in the box would help<br/>
finders decide on whether to search for the box. You may lose a few<br/>
finders who prefer to find carved stamps but those who are out there<br/>
for the adventure of discovering a new place and finding tupperware in<br/>
the park will go out for the hunt. <br/>
<br/>
I enjoy carving and have been carving for years now, even before I<br/>
heard about letterboxing. I primarily use a speedball lino cutter with<br/>
a #1 and #2 blade: http://www.artmaterials.com.au/images/lino_cutt.jpg<br/>
. I use a disposable testors knife (it has a thin very sharp blade)<br/>
http://www.prop-shop.com/g/t/tes8801.jpg to help cut out finicky<br/>
things like letters and eyes.<br/>
