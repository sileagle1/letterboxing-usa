                    <div class="plaintext-content">Please, help me out when you ask questions.<br/>
These things will help me help you.<br/>
<br/>
 - Read the FAQ before asking a question. It's being updated daily with new<br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
 - If you're having a problem with a specific box, let me know the name of<br/>
the box you were working on, along with at least a state.<br/>
<br/>
 - The 'move-a-box' feature is only available for boxes that have already<br/>
been entered by the webmasters on the new site.<br/>
 If your box exists on the new site, I need your member name in order to<br/>
transfer your boxes to you! Also, a list of box names helps.  If you say,<br/>
"Give me my boxes." I'll probably just write back and ask for a list.<br/>
 If your box is only on the old site, we'd prefer that you create an account<br/>
and put it in yourself.<br/>
<br/>
 - Email me off list, please.  It's just a lot easier for me to keep track<br/>
of things when I don't have to wade through the main list. Plus, we don't<br/>
need to clutter the main list with small issues like "Give me my boxes."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other notes:<br/>
 - Thanks for all the great suggestions!<br/>
 - If you see counties that aren't filled in, please let me know about those<br/>
as well.<br/>
 - As of this email, 1360 total boxes have been entered.  Cool.   Northeast<br/>
Connecticut leads the way with 158.<br/>
