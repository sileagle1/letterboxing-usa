<br/>
	I think that you can count my daughter, Meagan (age 11) and I in for<br/>
the get together on Sunday, Jan. 28.  We were planning to hit the<br/>
Mansfield area boxes on MLK Day but perhaps now we'll wait.  I'm<br/>
familiar with the UConn campus (Class of '94) but could use directions<br/>
to the Vernon fairgrounds.  When you get a firm concensus on food let me<br/>
know how I can contribute.  I like the idea of the<br/>
participation/attendance stamp and a carving contest sounds great; not<br/>
that I could compete with those I've seen (although I did try me hand at<br/>
carving my first stamp this past weekend).  What I'm really looking<br/>
forward to is meeting all of you out there who share in this<br/>
sport/hobby; I've been listening in for some time now and would love to<br/>
put faces to names.<br/>
