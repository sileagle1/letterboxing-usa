I hope the right people see this. <br/>
<br/>
I went out with my two boys today and found two boxes. "Sad Bug" and<br/>
"Spiraling Tree", both in Plainville MA.<br/>
<br/>
Neither box was rehidden when I found them. The first, "Sad Bug" was<br/>
supposed to be in a hole in a foundation wall, nestled next to a tree,<br/>
hidden by a round rock. It was all there but the rock was left 3' from<br/>
the box. <br/>
<br/>
The second, "Spiraling Tree," is located only 50' or so from the main<br/>
road of a cemetary and was supposed to be found hidden "next to" a<br/>
boulder. It was ther all right. Just sitting there in it's plastic bag<br/>
right next to the boulder clearly visible from 100' away. I could see<br/>
where the placers had carefully made a shallow depression and laid<br/>
several sticks and leaves to hide the box, but the last finder made no<br/>
effort whatsoever. <br/>

LOL!!! No I don't think that's needed. The notes indicated that they<br/>
were local to the two boxes and that the day of their finds were their<br/>
first day boxing.<br/>

Not that I'm an old salt at this, only started last summer myself.<br/>
Just wanted to throw the reminder out there. If you are those people<br/>
or maybe you're the one who introduced them to the activity just a<br/>
friendly reminder. <br/>

These people do need to be contacted and welcomed to the game.  <br/>
However, they also need to taught to rehide the boxes in the exact <br/>
matter in which the boxes were hid.  This can be done in a polite <br/>
manner, remember this individuals are newbies.<br/>
<br/>
We recently had a member of this search for a box that we hid.  <br/>
After she found it my daughter went back to retrieve the box as we <br/>
couldn't put it out on a permanent basis till the first of April.<br/>
She came back stating she couldn't find it.  My wife went back and <br/>
found it in the correct place, but behind some leaves as camoflauge.<br/>
Thanks to that individual, we learned something about hiding boxes <br/>
which will be with future hides.  That may be the case with these <br/>
indviduals.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend using the search engine that you found these boxes to <br/>
locate the parties and welcome them politely to the game and use it <br/>
as a teaching moment.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Is it possible that being polite isn't the answer.  If<br/>
you find the box hidden then rehide it so it can't be<br/>

polite won't work.  Even if you are new to the hobby,<br/>
how much more explanation do you need?  This is not a<br/>
difficult concept.  With the right amout of bananas<br/>
you could teach a monkey to hide something.  I'm so<br/>
tired of the newbie excuse.  When I first started, I<br/>
figured out, all on my own, that if the boxes were<br/>
seen it would ruin the fun of FINDING them.  <br/>
<br/>
For the individuals in question, how could you not<br/>
rehide the boxes?  Moreover, how could you not figure<br/>
it out for yourself.  Did your parents leave the gifts<br/>
out at Christmas so you could find them easier?  Get<br/>
my point?  Play right or don't play at all.  Is it<br/>
possible that this is too much responsibility for you<br/>
to handle?  If so, go be irresponsible somewhere else.<br/>
 There's a difference between a newbie and a clueless<br/>
dope.  Please stop confusing the two.  If you haven't<br/>
figured out witch one you are yet, then you are the<br/>
latter!  Same principle of being able to pick out the<br/>
sucker at a poker table.  If you can't spot the sucker<br/>
after 10 minutes....then it's you!!!<br/>

Feeling much better now,<br/>

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of holidays, it makes me think of the Easter Egg "Hunts" that I've <br/>
seen this weekend in this neck of the woods.  The "hunts" where all the eggs <br/>
are just laid out on the grass and the children race to see how many they can <br/>
pick up.  I don't quite understand the pleasure in that -- even when I was a <br/>
child I don't think I would've taken much pleasure in that -- but to each his <br/>
own.  <br/>
<br/>
We need a series of letterboxes that are just laid right out there -- folks <br/>
can "hike" from park bench to park bench, stamping in.  :-) <br/>

Doh!!  Anyhow, I like your idea about laying boxes out<br/>
in the open.  It should be a race to see who gets<br/>
there before some momos vandalize it.  Or how about<br/>
this, we just nail the boxes to trees, paint them<br/>
orange and put  neon signs on them.  Instead of "Eat<br/>
at Joe's" it could be "Box is here, vandals and<br/>
thieves stay away."  Maybe in like lime green so it<br/>
REALLY sticks out. <br/>

&gt; I recommend using the search engine that you found these boxes to <br/>
&gt; locate the parties and welcome them politely to the game and use it <br/>
&gt; as a teaching moment.<br/>

<br/>
And, if they and you are local to Plainville (or was that Plainview <br/>
MA?) you might offer to join them for a boxdate.  I know when I was a <br/>
newbie (almost a year ago) I was invited within the first week of <br/>
posting to LBNA to join Sam-I-am in my local area.  That was very <br/>
educational and fun.  And now I box with her Mom.  Also suggest they <br/>
join http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
<br/>
Hope I have repeated the other posts I haven't read yet.<br/>

Or how about<br/>
this, we just nail the boxes to trees, paint them<br/>
orange and put  neon signs on them.  Instead of "Eat<br/>
at Joe's" it could be "Box is here, vandals and<br/>
thieves stay away."  Maybe in like lime green so it<br/>
REALLY sticks out. <br/>

I did something similar with a box just as kind of a joke.    <br/>
<br/>
For right now at least, we're not putting any clues out about it.  Sometime <br/>
this summer, I'll probably begin posting clues one at a time, maybe beginning <br/>
with a photo of the box.<br/>
<br/>
It looks just like a homeowner's rural mailbox sitting on the side of the <br/>
road, except there's no house there, it's a vacant lot.  The mailbox is painted <br/>
red, white &amp; blue and says "Letterbox" on the side of it.  Inside, pushed all <br/>
the way to the back, is a stamp, inkpad, and logbook.  The first finder prize <br/>
is one of those little yellow eagles with a USPS t-shirt that they sell at <br/>
local post offices.  <br/>
<br/>
Right now we're just waiting to see if anyone happens to notice it.   So far, <br/>
not even the teens who cruise around every so often slamming into mailboxes <br/>
with their baseball bats have noticed it.  :-)   But it's in a neighborhood <br/>
where the teens don't cruise all that often.  The little eagle is still sitting <br/>
there awaiting it's new home.<br/>
<br/>
When I placed it, I figured it as the the ultimate drive-by box.  But hey, <br/>
it'll also work as the ultimate doofus box.  No rehiding necessary.  <br/>

I forget who mentioned it but regarding contacting the offenders via<br/>
the website where they found the clues, that would be Letterboxing.org<br/>
for which this IS the forum, right? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I will have to go back and see if I can find the name again, I have<br/>
forgotten it already. If I can maybe I will do some googling and see<br/>
if I can locate the folks.<br/>
<br/>
I think the idea of the mailbox hidden in plain site is hysterical, BTW.  <br/>

Had a great morning of letterboxing today but found one box not well<br/>
hidden.  Its bags weren't even closed and there was much water in the<br/>
outer bag and in the box itself.  Fortunately, double-bagging saved<br/>
the contents.  But what was iteresting was that the last one to stamp<br/>
was the Winter Boxing Drive which took place recently in Hartford<br/>
County.  Just a reminder of those going on boxing drives, seal those<br/>
bags and rehide well.  This box was in the open and we didn't need<br/>
the last 2 clues since it was in plain sight.  The box I am talking<br/>
about is Coins of the Lane.  We dried it out and gave it new bags and<br/>
completely concealed it.  <br/>
<br/>
Other boxes found, all in good shape:<br/>
Giant African Millipede<br/>
Freedom Schooner Amistad<br/>
The Burnside Letterbox<br/>
Silver Lane <br/>
Hattori Hanzo Series of 3<br/>
Mark Twain<br/>
Stacy's Dolphin<br/>
<br/>
Looked for the Graduate, but it had either been retired or is missing<br/>
- unless that hole under the tree was not the obvious spot as it<br/>
appeared to be with lots of covering material scattered around.<br/>
