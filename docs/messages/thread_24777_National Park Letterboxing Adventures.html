grief from National Park Rangers. This time it is the scary sounding "law  <br/>

So just a reminder to all in letterbox land: it is possible to plant  <br/>
letterboxes on NPS properties if you collaborate with your local rangers. There  are <br/>
several good examples of this on the letterboxing.org website. <br/>

If you do not get permission to box in a national park, please do not  expose <br/>
us little helpers to threats and liabilities. While me may agree with the  <br/>
principles, we can't afford to take on the government. Please do not post  <br/>
National Parks letterbox clues on letterboxing.org. If your box is anywhere  near a <br/>
national park, please consider putting a big fat note on the clues  stating <br/>
"this box is not on national park property." Something even  a gendarme would <br/>
understand.<br/>

<br/>
Here's an excerpt:<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing involves the placement of a cache containing a stamp and an inkpad that enables participants to document that they found the specific location. Participants find the location by following “clues.” Clues often involve map coordinates or compass bearings, but most letterboxes currently in existence do not require the use of a GPS device. Although letterboxing is intended to be environmentally friendly, if the “box” is buried or concealed by manipulated<br/>
vegetation or rocks, or will cause participants to create social trails or traverse sensitive or dangerous locations, the impacts will likely be unacceptable. However, it is entirely possible that some parks, particularly those with a vast expanse of backcountry, will have locations where a letterbox could be concealed and sought out without causing unacceptable impacts. In those cases, the superintendent has the option to designate locations where, or establish conditions under which, the cache could be left unattended—for example, in the same location as an NPSsponsored summit log.<br/>
