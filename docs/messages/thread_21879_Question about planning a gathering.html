Funny, I was wondering the same thing.  I just rented a shelter in a <br/>
county park for a gathering in OCT.  I needed to supply a group name.  <br/>
I told them it was just a group of hiking friends getting together - <br/>
sort of like a reunion.  I didn't want to mention "letterboxing" in <br/>
case it opened up a whole can of worms.  I figured I could just <br/>
say "scavenger hunt" the day of the event if anyone asks what is going <br/>
on.<br/>

out that part of the form. When I was asked, I just said it was a<br/>
bunch of friends from across the Great Lakes getting together. They<br/>
had a sub-rule in their rules that basically stated if I lied on the<br/>
form, I would be held liable, so I didn't offer anything much, and I<br/>
don't think anything was ever written down.  Also, be careful with<br/>
"scavenger hunt".  If I had put that down on the IL form, it would<br/>
have raised lots of red flags, because there was also a clause that<br/>
prohibited any kind of destruction or removal of plants, etc. in the<br/>
park.  If they think you a scavengering for plants, mushrooms, etc.<br/>
they might really take notice.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When we pulled in to Brazos Bend for the recent Texas gathering, the woman<br/>
behind the desk at the State Park office cheerfully asked if we were part of<br/>
"that letterboxing group"...my husband and I looked at each other and<br/>
hesitated, but she went on to say that someone in a car before us had<br/>
explained the whole deal to her and she thought it sounded like a lot of<br/>
fun. <br/>
Later on we met her husband who explained that they are "Campground Hosts" -<br/>
retired volunteers who do a few odd jobs around the State Park in return for<br/>
free lodging etc.<br/>
No one seemed concerned about our gathering - and in fact whoever it was who<br/>
talked to them obviously did a great job of positive publicity!<br/>
