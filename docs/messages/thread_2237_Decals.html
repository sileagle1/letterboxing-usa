&gt;2) While the 6" square decals are big, let's face it, they're still<br/>
&gt;okay. (Not the bumper-sticker shape we were expecting, but they are<br/>
&gt;still fine for the majority of us.)<br/>
<br/>
Speaking for myself, but I never thought of the decals as a bumper sticker. <br/>
I thought they were originally talked about as window decals. At least that <br/>
was my mind set. Truth told, I like the shape, it will stand out more on <br/>
the back, side window on the family wagon and van.<br/>
<br/>
As intelligent and creative a group of people as we have on this list, we <br/>
all should be able to figure out a multitude of good, creative uses for <br/>
these decals.<br/>
<br/>
My ideas:       back windows and decals<br/>
                 scissors and decals<br/>
