The Blue Hills Birthday Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
To celebrate her 11 years<br/>
Maddie invited to a hike her friends' dear<br/>
<br/>
They all knew the Hills of Blue<br/>
What could be done to make this new?<br/>
<br/>
So, a letterbox, carefully hid<br/>
Added a treasure hunt for all the kids.<br/>
<br/>
The hill named for a great signatory<br/>
Was chosen for this special foray<br/>
<br/>
A rocky trail, if they followed the clues<br/>
Would lead them to an awesome view<br/>
<br/>
To duplicate their climbing feat<br/>
First by the State Police Station you should meet<br/>
<br/>
Visit their horses if you like<br/>
Before you begin this pleasant hike.<br/>
<br/>
And here now ends this little rhyme<br/>
To be sure you find this box this time!<br/>
<br/>
This is a short hike at Blue Hills Reservation in Milton, MA. The <br/>
trip to the box may take as little as 15 minutes if you ignore the <br/>
views. However, the trail is steep in places with lots of loose rocks <br/>
and protruding tree roots. Proceed carefully and wear shoes <br/>
appropriate for hiking. <br/>
<br/>
Driving directions to the start: From Route 128/Route 93, take Exit 2 <br/>
toward Milton onto Route 138. Take a right onto Blue Hill River Road. <br/>
Where Blue Hill River Road turns left at a stop sign stay straight <br/>
and the road becomes Hillside Street.<br/>
Continue past the parking lot for Houghton's Pond until you come<br/>
to <br/>
the Blue Hills Reservation Headquarters and the State Police Station <br/>
on the Left. Opposite are 2 small parking lots. If these are full, go <br/>
back and park in the Houghton's Pond lot.<br/>
<br/>
Hike: Enter the driveway next to the stables  at the road is a<br/>
waist <br/>
high post marked for the North Skyline Trail and there is a large <br/>
sign for Reservation Headquarters. Head up the hill, past the visitor <br/>
center (which is a small house on the right). You may want to pick up <br/>
a map for $1.00 there or have with you the map posted at the Blue <br/>
Hills Letterbox Clues, http://www.whiteblazes.com/lbna/bluehills.pdf<br/>
<br/>
Walk past the barrier to cars. About 70 steps further uphill, you <br/>
will see on the right a sign for the North Skyline Trail and a blue <br/>
rectangle  the sign for this trail. Turn right onto this trail<br/>
and <br/>
follow those Blue rectangles up the hill. Depending on the season, <br/>
there will be places where you will see small trails crossing yours <br/>
or bearing off. When in doubt scout for the blue markers. They are <br/>
never far apart.<br/>
<br/>
You will come to a spot where the trail levels out and there is a <br/>
great view to the Right. Admire the view, but then continue. Stop <br/>
where the trail starts going downhill.  Stand on the blue marker in <br/>
the middle of the exposed rock area. The microwave tower on Big Blue <br/>
Hill can be seen at 260 degrees. There will be two small trails off <br/>
to the right. Take the left one that heads off at about 340 degrees. <br/>
(The middle trail, if the Skyline Trail is considered). <br/>
<br/>
Continue a short distance until you come to a clearing. Stop where <br/>
the trail meets the clearing. A pretty pine tree will be to your left <br/>
at 280 degrees. Boston, if the sky is clear, is at 20 degrees. Walk <br/>
at 60 degrees (right) 10 adult steps. Face the continuing trail <br/>
80 <br/>
degrees. See a jumble of rocks going slightly downhill on the left of <br/>
the trail. They might be a good place to sit and look at the Boston <br/>
view if they were smoother.* One of the larger rocks leans on <br/>
another, leaving a tilted rectangular shaped opening. Go around the <br/>
rocks to where the opening comes out. To the right, see a flat <br/>
triangular rock leaning against the big leaning rock and another <br/>
oblong one. Look in the gap under the triangle rock for your prize. <br/>
[Please replace triangle rock carefully after you put away the box.]<br/>
<br/>
*If you haven't found the box, from the asterisk above, try these <br/>
alternate instructions: Notice that 2 of the larger rocks, at about <br/>
320 degrees, have points toward the sky. Go the point furthest from <br/>
you. The point is lichen covered and, if you put your compass on it, <br/>
you will see it points toward Boston and nearly true north. Go around <br/>
the rock so you are downhill from it. (Careful  the smaller<br/>
rocks <br/>
are loose). A shorter oblong rock is beside you and meets the pointed <br/>
one. A flat triangle rock has been placed to mask the gap between <br/>
these two. Remove that rock and reach into the gap for your reward.<br/>
<br/>
To return, retrace your steps until you meet up again with the Blue <br/>
skyline trail. To go back to Headquarters and your car, follow the <br/>
blue path toward the left. To continue onto Big Blue Hill or the <br/>
either of the Blue Hills Letterbox or City Lights Letterbox, follow <br/>
the blue trail downhill to the right  see those clues for<br/>
further <br/>
directions. <br/>
