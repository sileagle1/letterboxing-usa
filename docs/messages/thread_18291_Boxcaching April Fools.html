I appreciate an April fool's joke like the next person, but I don't<br/>
appreciate our web site being associated with your April fools joke. Please<br/>
take the "boxcaching" joke site down immediately. At the bare minimum,<br/>
remove all associated logos and references to Geocaching.com<br/>

If that's the case, then you can relax. It'll be gone tomorrow. If I'm<br/>
wrong and it isn't, then you can get just as bent out of shape over it<br/>

I found the boxcaching site to quite hilarious.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, Jeremy is completely within his rights to request the removal of the logo and name as he is one of the owners of geocaching.com and they have a copyright on the logo and name.<br/>
<br/>
One of the responsabilities that goes with obtaining a copyright is the enforcement of the copyright.  Failure to do so may result in the copyright being withdrawn.  There are posted usage guidelines on the geocaching.com site that indicate that the logo may be used on non-commercial pages as long as it portays geocaching.com in a positive light and is linked to the geocaching.com site.<br/>
<br/>
While I personally don't see this portraying geocaching.com in a bad light, that is a decision that is up to the owner of the copyright.  There is already bad blood between some members of both the letterboxing and geocaching communities and I would hate to see this spill over into a legal battle.<br/>

It just occurred to me that it's entirely possible Jeremy could be in<br/>
on this. I'm not accusing him, merely pointing out the possibility, as<br/>
any good conspiracy theorist would. If it were to turn out that Jeremy<br/>
was one of the punkers, rather than one of the punk'd, then the joke<br/>
is far larger than any of us have believed.<br/>
<br/>
Again, merely a supposition -- just my idle mind turning over the<br/>
possibilities. I do not know Jeremy and I bear him no ill will.<br/>
<br/>
The truth is out there. Trust no-one.<br/>
