We tried this one yesterday--August 13.  The walk was fun, the clues <br/>
were interesting and precise, but the box, which was supposed to <br/>
be "nearby" the "sunny pin," was nowhere to be found.  Drove us crazy <br/>
for 45 minutes before we moved on to the next box.<br/>
<br/>
Nobska was our first box, BTW.<br/>
