you are logged in, you can say that you have found one and keep track <br/>
of the boxes you have found. Geocaching has it. I placed one sort of <br/>
far from me and the only way to see if anyone has found it or make <br/>
sure it is ok is to go there but I can't very often. The only problem <br/>
is that people might give away the location, but hopefully it wouldn't <br/>
happen very often.<br/>
