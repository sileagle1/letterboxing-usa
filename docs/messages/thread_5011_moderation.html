Once again, I have received a request to moderate an individual.  Those <br/>
of you who know me personally know I abhor moderation in all but the most<br/>
extreme of circumstances.  Moreover, moderation tends to end up being more<br/>
of a symbolic, rather than practical gesture.<br/>
<br/>
In this case, however, warnings about civility have been previously issued, <br/>
and I have judged the behaviour to still be out of the bounds of the warnings, <br/>
and the etiquette parameters of the list.  We all love a good argument or <br/>
heated debate sometimes, but there is no place on the list for rudeness, <br/>
meanness, flooding, nor language inappropriate for the 3 to 93 year old set.<br/>
As a list manager, it is a tough job to balance the right of the few to make <br/>
points via rude, mean spirited, and unsavory language vs the desire of the <br/>
many to have a list as free of those things as possible.<br/>
<br/>
If you disagree (or agree) with my decision to moderate the address<br/>
glenn.hansen@usa.net, e-mail me.<br/>

I've asked the moderators to moderate the list more aggressively.  <br/>
I've asked them to take a zero tolerance stance towards uncivil <br/>
posts and people (aka "flames" and "trolls").  Each moderator has<br/>
a different style and attitudes about this, so uncivility may be<br/>
dealt with by warning, moderation, or banning, but it is going to<br/>
be dealt with.  We will have no formal rules or procedures about<br/>
this.  Hopefully, once any trolls that may or may not exist are <br/>
gone, we won't need any.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that civility is judged by the tone and approach of<br/>
the message, not the opinion or who the sender is.  It is possible<br/>
to strongly disagree with someone, yet be civil about it.  In<br/>
my opinion, this is ok in small doses, and a good moderator can tell <br/>
the difference.  OTOH, sometimes people simply don't want to deal<br/>
with debates of any kind after a while.  When this is the case, <br/>
lighten up and let it go -- give it a break.  Show some courtesy to <br/>
the rest of the list, and take it off-list.  But you should not be <br/>
moderated for civil discourse, no matter how off the wall your <br/>
opinion is, unless you are beating a dead horse, which most people, <br/>
I think, feel is uncivil in a community environment.<br/>
<br/>
Some people will undoubtedly philosophize that moderation is a<br/>
restriction of freedom, violates their first amendment rights, <br/>
and other words along these lines.  Rubbish.  Most people agree<br/>
that modern society based on order and rule of law trumps the <br/>
law of the jungle, and those that try to undermine order are dealt <br/>
with by the majority.  All the intellectual headbanging aside, the <br/>
fact of the matter is that people are afraid to read mail, afraid <br/>
to post, and don't want to be here.  What sort of freedom is that?<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that my lazzez-faire approach has failed.  That's<br/>
sad, and disappoints me greatly, but life goes on.  Note that this<br/>
change should not affect you if you are in the habit of being <br/>
civil and not beating dead horses into the ground.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of tips for e-mail etiquette around the net.  And<br/>
there are many reasons why e-mail fails as a communication medium,<br/>
the biggest being the role of the reader internalizing the sender<br/>
and role playing him, usually as an aggressor when he was not meant<br/>
to be.  This is because the human brain needs a sender of communication<br/>
to process it.  This stuff is beyond the scope of this post, but I <br/>
will throw in a couple of tips --<br/>
<br/>
1) Think before you send.  Compose your post, if it is controversial,<br/>
wait 30 minutes, and decide how you would react if you received it.<br/>
<br/>
2) Put a disclaimer at the top.  "This is not a flame."  "The intent<br/>
of my language is this".  Corny, but it can work if you need to<br/>
use certain language.  Of course, if you do that, and its still a<br/>
flame, you're still off the island ... this is for text that you think<br/>
could be misconstrued.<br/>
<br/>
3) And the biggie -- IMO almost all e-mail problems result from the<br/>
second post.  That is, the reader takes offense when none was intended<br/>
by the sender of the first post.  The reader reacts, and the first<br/>
poster has no choice but to defend himself.  Please be aware of <br/>
second post syndrome, and try to give the sender the benefit of<br/>
the doubt, and no overreact.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully the list will be a better place with some light moderation.<br/>
If not, we'll try something else.  The intent isn't to run a kingdom<br/>
around here, but I'm burnt out on the systemic meltdowns.  Feedback<br/>
good or bad welcome at the moderator list.  Note that this is not<br/>
blanket moderation, but targeted reactive moderation of individuals<br/>
who break the rules of civility.  I still have faith that the group<br/>
and the moderators can work together to define these rules as time<br/>
goes by.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, if you have a dispute with moderator action or inaction, come<br/>
to me, but please try to lighten up and let it go first.  Moderators<br/>
will make mistakes like everyone else.  I don't want to be in the<br/>
position of god, and I'm sure the list doesn't want that either.<br/>
<br/>
I'm out of time.  I could write the last paragraph better.  Common<br/>
sense goes along way.  Lighten up goes further still.  Hopefully<br/>
the list will improve.<br/>
<br/>

I totally agree with the sentiment of what Mark said. I think that <br/>
Randy has taken the coarse of action that makes the most sense and is <br/>
the best interest of this group.  I too received several private <br/>
emails yesterday from people expressing their feelings about what has <br/>
been going on lately and I too encourage you to stay put, brave the <br/>
storm and see what the moderators are capable of.  Has Randy has <br/>
explained we have different moderators with different styles, some <br/>
will moderate, some will bad, some will send sweet little warnings <br/>
first.  For those wondering what my style will be at this point, you <br/>
can pretty much bet that the first person I see name calling, <br/>
personally attacking someone, or beating a dead horse repeatedly will <br/>
be removed from the island without being voted off  I will consider <br/>
it failure of a competition and disqualification in the game.<br/>

acknowledge the amount of effort that goes into running a list of <br/>
this size, as well as maintaining the LbnA companion website.  I am <br/>
well aware of just how much work goes on "behind the scenes" and am <br/>
loath to criticize the list owner or moderators. However, I do think <br/>
things went waaaayyyyy beyond my comfort zone as far as respect for <br/>
each other goes, and I can't help but feel, "it's about time!"<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I would like to point out the list membership is somewhere <br/>
over 1400 people and thank the overwhelming number of members who <br/>
demonstrated respect, responsibility, and dignity by refraining to <br/>
participate in the recent rash of terrible posts. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Third, I am glad to see that some additional oversight will be <br/>
instituted with regard to message posting, even though it will be an <br/>
additional burden on the list owner and moderators.  I don't know if <br/>
you are aware of this, but all messages are archived... yes, even <br/>
every shameful post is stored for posterity.  <br/>
<br/>
When I first discovered Letterboxing, I reviewed the archives of <br/>
this list.  I almost didn't join the list after reading through the <br/>
messages from August, when another flare up of this flaming was <br/>
raging.  However, I understand that there are bound to be <br/>
disagreements whenever such a large number of people are involved. <br/>
I persevered .... yet I wonder how many members and potential <br/>
members have been lost due to the "tone" or "vibes" that are evident <br/>
in the archives.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to have taken up time not discussing letterboxing. I'll try to <br/>
stay on topic from now on. (But wondering if I still need to wear my <br/>
asbestos underwear when I log into this list.)<br/>

just came back on two days ago.  Less than 24 hours later I pulled <br/>
myself back off the list, appalled at what had happened to it while I <br/>
was gone.   <br/>
     It's a sad fact, but a real one, that it's very hard these days <br/>
for a list to survive and be useful without moderation.  It doesn't <br/>
take very many people to ruin it for everyone else.  I'm sure there <br/>
will be gripes about the moderation--there always are--but most of us <br/>
will be very grateful--at least most of the time.  <br/>

Personally knowing your experience with online forums and mailing <br/>
lists I find this question to be quite silly, however I am guessing <br/>
that your intent here was to educate others or to have something <br/>
clearly spelled out for the list members by having someone else <br/>
clarify.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to be that the term moderator defines it all at this point <br/>
however.<br/>
<br/>
Moderator:<br/>
1.	One that moderates, as: <br/>
a.	One that arbitrates or mediates. <br/>
b.	One who presides over a meeting, forum, or debate. <br/>
<br/>
Further more I think that if you read Randy's post carefully it tells <br/>
you exactly what actions the moderators may or may not take. <br/>
<br/>
"I've asked the moderators to moderate the list more aggressively.<br/>
I've asked them to take a zero tolerance stance towards uncivil<br/>
posts and people (aka "flames" and "trolls"). Each moderator has<br/>
a different style and attitudes about this, so uncivility may be<br/>
dealt with by warning, moderation, or banning, but it is going to<br/>
be dealt with. We will have no formal rules or procedures about<br/>
this."<br/>
<br/>
There are several moderators on the list Steve and I think each on <br/>
will be handling things currently in the way they most see fit.  I do <br/>
know that for several of us, our tolerance for the ridiculous, the <br/>
instigating, and the callous have long passed and I think at least <br/>
temporarily you will be seeing a very heavy hand from a few of the <br/>
moderators.  <br/>
<br/>
I really don't think anyone needs to be worried about being moderated <br/>
or banned though, quite honestly I think if anyone has a concern that <br/>
their topic, words or attitude might get them "dealt with" by a <br/>
moderator they should hit delete before hand or just stay silent on <br/>
the list, save us all the trouble of getting our rulers out and hand <br/>
slapping.<br/>
<br/>
I bid you well,<br/>

Some people need to lighten up.  This is a list for families<br/>
and persons interested in letterboxing.  Trust me, it is not<br/>
as good as the Jerry Springer show :-)<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, a discussion of postal boxes on this list<br/>
is better than a flame war about whether postal boxes should<br/>
be discussed on this list.  But that is just me.  Obviously,<br/>
certain individuals think differently.  I am at a loss to<br/>
understand the thought process of these persons.<br/>
<br/>
I personally don't care what is discussed on this list, so<br/>
long as it is moderately related to letterboxing -- even related<br/>
off-topic is ok within reason (such as what brand of backpack<br/>
to buy, for example).  Postal boxes would certainly fall into<br/>
here.  I give the moderators and members wide reign in interpreting<br/>
this.  The reason for this is simple and two fold.  1)  This list,<br/>
historically, HAS ALWAYS BEEN PART OF THE GAME OF LETTERBOXING,<br/>
and the handful of old-timer(s) left who help create this place<br/>
want it that way, and who is a moderator (or anyone else, for that<br/>
matter, to judge who is gaming), and 2) I believe freedom,<br/>
self-moderation, and distributed, social pressure trump centralized<br/>
rule by diktat.<br/>
<br/>
But this list always disappoints me in the abuse of the freedom<br/>
I give it, because a handful of folks just don't get it.  I'm not<br/>
going to give yet another speech on how it is generally the<br/>
receiver that misinterprets tone of the sender of e-mail that<br/>
leads to flames.  The archives are replete with my opinions on<br/>
how to behave over e-mail, as is the net at large.  Some people<br/>
simply do not care, and these would be the target of such speech<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I am considering turning on full moderation (and thus having the<br/>
few punish the many), and I solicit (off-list to me only) opinions<br/>
on this prospective action.  At the end of the day, I want this<br/>
to be a better place, and if people think full moderation for<br/>
everyone to prevent future outbreaks of uncivility will get that<br/>
done, then a few clicks will make it so (and SpringChick, I'd<br/>
love you as a moderator if this happens, because once again,<br/>
the inconsiderate actions of a few will cause more volunteer<br/>
time wasted for everyone, because certain people just don't have<br/>
the self-control to moderate themselves, and do their share to<br/>
pitch in to the collective effort of making this a better place<br/>
(classic example of "tragedy of the commons").  Take a poll if<br/>
you want, otherwise I'll make a call based on what I see in my<br/>
inbox over the next few days.  (Yes, I've threatened this before,<br/>
and it wasn't (and isn't) idle.  Last time, people wanted things<br/>
the way they are).<br/>
<br/>
And no matter what is decided, the next flame war that erupts,<br/>
I may just turn it on without asking the list.<br/>
<br/>
Here are my thoughts on the recent incident, FWTW --<br/>
<br/>
* Despite the open list charter, a majority have decided that<br/>
postal boxes are better discussed elsewhere.   That's fine, and<br/>
shows the open charter is working.  An example of local self-<br/>
organization rather than centralized diktat.  That is a Good<br/>
Thing, and persons or moderators are allowed to use their<br/>
judgement in enforcing it or not.<br/>
<br/>
* I don't think it is a crime that someone posted about a<br/>
postal box, despite this rule.  Perhaps they didn't know it.<br/>
Perhaps they hit the wrong line in their address book.  It<br/>
is better to assume an honest mistake than self-righteous<br/>
assumption of malicious violation of the list charter, and<br/>
the resultant flame war.<br/>
<br/>
* Lori's message.  Lori has been around here long enough that<br/>
she should know you absolutely have to walk on eggshells if<br/>
you want to say something.  People apparently feel it is<br/>
interesting to debate whether Lori's message was polite or<br/>
not.  Only Lori knows that, and everyone else is engaging<br/>
in personal interpretation.  I'll interpret and guess that<br/>
those who like postal boxes thought it was impolite, and those<br/>
who dislike them thought it was polite.  But then again, I<br/>
am a student of Umberto Eco, semiotics, and the principle of<br/>
the role of the reader.  If you don't get it, nevermind (but<br/>
I recommend some of his fiction (the non-fiction is<br/>
pretty tough ...).  And I'm just guessing like everyone else<br/>
anyway.  The best interpretation is one that GIVES<br/>
THE POSTER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT (but I said I would not<br/>
lecture on e-mail etiquette ...).  That's not saying I think<br/>
the message was polite, its just better in the long run to<br/>
not to follow with another 100 clearly impolite ones.  If<br/>
you feel it is moderator malfeasance -- send to me directly --<br/>
don't start a flame war.<br/>
<br/>
That said, a better wording of Lori's message might have been --<br/>
<br/>
"The group in the past has decided that postal boxes are off<br/>
topic for this list.  It is understandable that you may not<br/>
have been aware of this decision, especially if you are a newbie,<br/>
and that's ok, its not the end of our world.  Postal boxes<br/>
are discussed at http:// ..." [but then again, I can see where<br/>
people will construe this message as impolite, especially if<br/>
they really like postal boxes.  Just goes to show the truth<br/>
of what I say, because I'm trying to be polite].<br/>
<br/>
It could have been off-list also, but there is value in<br/>
reiterating cultural values on-list for others who may not be<br/>
aware.  But it has to be for that purpose -- not some self-<br/>
righteous I'm smarter than you because I know the rules.<br/>
<br/>
* What goes on off-list.  Someone posted 4 messages alleging<br/>
flames being sent off-list.  That is totally inappropriate.<br/>
Hearsay off-list is not admissible on-list, and even if it<br/>
was, I'm not going to touch it (except perhaps to ban the<br/>
person who brings this hearsay).  What goes on in the<br/>
kindergarten down the hall has no bearing on our fine pre-school.<br/>
<br/>
* Moderators vs members.  Moderators are allowed to post as<br/>
members.  When I post as list manager, I generally sign it as<br/>
such, when I post as a member, I generally don't.  I'd like<br/>
all moderators to follow this convention, tho I've never asked<br/>
them to, as I'm not big into rules.  For the most part, they do.<br/>
<br/>
That said, moderators are held to a higher standard.  We've had<br/>
to dismiss moderator(s) in the past because in my judgement they<br/>
were using moderator authority to sanctify personal opinion.<br/>
Moderators have to be more neutral than the rest of us when they<br/>
are doing things that look like moderator things, and I watch<br/>
it.  I am also getting feedback from several different sources<br/>
that I trust about moderators and I am watching that also.  I<br/>
have passed these concerns onto the individuals in question.<br/>
We'll see if everyone is able to lighten up.  But I've<br/>
dismissed moderators before, and I'll do it again if I think<br/>
that is best for the list (but then I may have to deal with<br/>
six months of personal flame mail and editorials on other<br/>
letterboxing sites a year after the fact -- some people do take<br/>
this _way_ to seriously ... :-))<br/>
