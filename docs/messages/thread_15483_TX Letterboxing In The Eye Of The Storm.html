Antman and I decided to go letterboxing today.  We managed<br/>
to avoid the worst of the rain by heading east and were able <br/>
to place a few and find a few.  We found all three of Droop's<br/>
boxes (Louisiana Welcome, Texas Welcome &amp; Tall Pine) and<br/>
found my Letterbox Bozo HH, too.  Baby Bear took it and<br/>
will be taking it out of the state soon.<br/>
I must say that Droop's stamps were really nice and well<br/>
worth traveling for.<br/>
<br/>
This also marked the first year anniversary of letterboxing<br/>
for Baby Bear and I.  We found our first box at Finch Arboretum<br/>
in Spokane, WA. on 8/31/02 and even found the infamous Hitch <br/>
(Alfred Hitchcock) Hitchhiker in our first find.  It has<br/>
been a fun year even though it has not taken off in Texas<br/>
as much as we would like yet.  I have incorporated letterboxing<br/>
into my vacations as much as the family will allow and it<br/>
has taken us to some great places I would never have known about.<br/>
Here's to another great letterboxing year, and<br/>
IN YOUR FACE, GRACE!!!<br/>
