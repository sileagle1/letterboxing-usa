 Team Jedi tried something..<br/>
<br/>
 We put out 3 sets of two boxes.  In each area we had 2 boxes.  One of the <br/>
boxes we set out and the other one we set out about 5 feet away from the first box BUT we handled the box after eating something. There was nothing<br/>
inside these boxes. (Just Empty Boxes)<br/>
<br/>
   GUESS WHAT!!!   All 3 of the boxes<br/>
that had the smell of the food from our fingers were gone or Chewed up!!  The other 3 did not have a nick in them and were still there!<br/>
<br/>
   Make sure when placing or hunting<br/>
you do not have the smell of food on<br/>
your hands. The Oils will hold the oder<br/>
of the food for a long time. With critters and their very good nack for<br/>
smelling, They think it's Lunch time..<br/>

I have now added wet wipes to clean my hands before looking for any boxes. LOL.   I have found quite a few boxes since I've started that have been opened and partly eaten by animals.   Usually you have to hunt all over for the pieces.   Really makes for a fun hunt. LOL<br/>

<br/>
WE've lost a few boxes in our area due to the same thing ... even the logs stated that the cachers/letterboxers stopped at a fast food place before hitting our boxes.   Drat !<br/>
<br/>
Have you considered doing a similar experiment after smoking a cigar or cigarettes?  I can count on loosing a box or seeing critter damage after a certain cigar smoking person in our area has visited one of our boxes (7 out of 10 times).<br/>
