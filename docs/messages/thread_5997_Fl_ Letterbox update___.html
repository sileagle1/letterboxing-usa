letterboxing.  However, things didn't work out quite as I had hoped.  <br/>
I first wanted to find "Bird of Paradise", but unfortunately it has <br/>
come up missing in action. In the same general vacinity was "Let's go <br/>
sailing". It also has come up missing. Despite having been <br/>
disappointed as well as being drenched from being caught out in a <br/>
typical Florida thunderstorm, I proceeded back out to Ft. DeSoto <br/>
where I had been a few weeks ago but didn't have my stamp.  I stamped <br/>
the book and noticed that there have been so many people out there <br/>
that a trail is forming... NOT GOOD! Let's be careful in covering <br/>
ourt tracks.  Maybe a slight change is lecation is needed for this <br/>
one. KOKOPELLI PAUL         <br/>
