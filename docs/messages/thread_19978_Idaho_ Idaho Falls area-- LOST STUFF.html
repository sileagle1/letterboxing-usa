                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is a letterbox report of sorts. While checking on our "Early Hunters" LB, and searching for A and J-Bear's "Last of the Elephants" and CW Sun Seeker's "Cave Series", we found a letterboxer's carving kit, most of it appeared intact. We will be at the KOA campground in Idaho Falls from 8/19 to 8/23. If this belongs to a local letterboxer you can find us in E 11, or you can try and check with Cadenza as she will be meeting with us this weekend. Sad news on the "Last of the Elephants" we are fairly sure that the LB was found by vandals as was Box #1 of the "Cave Series" . One of them had a purple lid. The Box #2 was in place and had a few stampins and a written note from someone that just found the letterbox. Normally I would use the "Contact the Placer" function, but we can only go on line for a few minutes, so this is the only method available.  If Cadenza is reading this we are here, and my shoot schedule is Fri. 12 noon to about 4pm, Sat. 9:00am to 1pm., and Sun.1pm til 6pm. or so. Either Fri. nite or Sat. nite would work for a BBQ. Crater's of the Moon turned out to be a bust as the road to the cave area was closed for resurfacing. We did get A&amp;J Bears "Devil's Fire".<br/>
