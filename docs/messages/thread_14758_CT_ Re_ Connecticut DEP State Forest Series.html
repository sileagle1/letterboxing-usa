enjoy the company again.<br/>
I wonder if anyone is close to getting all 30 boxes, maybe Wanda and <br/>
Pete, or Bluebird and Music Woman?<br/>
In these days of cut backs and loss of state sponsered services its <br/>
nice to see some time being spent to help educate us on the forests <br/>
and provide a healthy hobby.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hello everyone!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At long last, all 30 Connecticut State Forest Letterboxes are <br/>
placed and the <br/>
&gt; clues posted.  These boxes have been posted to celebrate the <br/>
centennial of <br/>
&gt; Connecticut's first state forest, Meshomasic, in Portland (and 2nd <br/>
in the <br/>
&gt; country).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can recognize these boxes by their posting on the <br/>
letterboxing.org site <br/>
&gt; as DEP State Forest boxes - for example, DEP Meshomasic State <br/>
Forest (although <br/>
&gt; there is something wrong with one of the American Legion State <br/>
Forest <br/>
&gt; postings).  Or, you can go directly to the DEP letterboxing page at:<br/>
&gt; <a <br="">
HREF="http://www.dep.state.ct.us/burnatr/forestry/centen/letterbox.htm<br/>
"&gt;http://www.dep.state.ct.us/burnatr/forestry/centen/letterbox.htm</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As an incentive to search for these boxes, if you visit five of <br/>
these boxes <br/>
&gt; and let DEP know (at DEP.Forestry@p...), you are eligible for a <br/>
&gt; patch.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a newly announced incentive, if you visit all 30 boxes and let <br/>
us know, we <br/>
&gt; will send you an official CT DEP Forestry walking stick!  Who'll be <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; first.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck, enjoy the search.  If the letterbox community is <br/>
interested, DEP <br/>
&gt; Forestry along with the CT Forest and Park Association is planning <br/>
a big <br/>
&gt; Forestry Field Day on October 4th at People's State Forest in <br/>
Barkhamstead.  Perhaps <br/>
&gt; the letterboxers would like to participate - have a booth or table <br/>
to explain <br/>
&gt; letterboxing or just a gathering to trade stamps.  If anyone would <br/>
like to be <br/>
&gt; part of this and wants to take a role in organizing it, you can let <br/>
me know <br/>
&gt; at chris.donnelly@p...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Take care / good luck.  Enjoy the Forest!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chris <br/>
