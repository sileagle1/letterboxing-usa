back on the site since our return from vacation, and when I saw <br/>
the "boxcaching" my mouth dropped open.  My consternation didn't <br/>
last long, as I quickly realized what day it is.  I have to say it <br/>
kept me giggling for an hour or so -- what's the harm?  Hasn't there <br/>
been some kind of April Fool's prank every year on this site?  <br/>
Thanks for a fun day.<br/>
