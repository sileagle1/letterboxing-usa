                    <div class="plaintext-content">Reading all the discussions about databases and other problems lately took me back to when I first, accidentally found out about this sport. It was not that long ago (Last March) that I found my first stamp and since then have found 30 and placed 3 of my own out there. In the search of the elusive stamp I've found much more, Parks and Greenways I didn't know about or probably would never have visited because of their small size. In them I have found deer, bald eagles, hawks, waterfalls, historic ruins and yes, a small stamp in a plastic box.  When checking my boxes, it seems the comments left by visiting Letterboxers (60 Plus) feel the same way. In the journals there are no old timers or newbies, it's hard to believe that you can have either with a sport that's only be in this country for 5 or so years.  As for the database, I live in Rhode Island and there's a phobia called the Rhode Island Mentality. If you drive more than 15 minutes from home it's an adventure, an hour it's a weekend trip. So for those inflicted by this phobia the database is a great thing. (I'm original from Kansas so I'm not inflicted with this illness.) So if you don't want your sites listed on the database, note it on your clues page and I'm sure almost all will honor your wishes. It's time to end this debate and get out there , enjoy  nature and let us know about the parts of your treks that don't give clues away.       <br/>
