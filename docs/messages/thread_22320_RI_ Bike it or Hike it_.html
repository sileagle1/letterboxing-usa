                    <div class="plaintext-content">Only 3 boxes away from 100 planted. It's getting harder to find new <br/>
bike trails in my tri-state area of CT-MA-RI. I keep having to go <br/>
further and further away. I enjoy the new scenery, but it becomes <br/>
harder to maintain boxes. The newest Letterbox is located East of <br/>
Providence, RI and is called Ten Mile River Greenway. Map coming soon. <br/>
See "whats new". Hopefully I'll be able to plant box #100 this summer.<br/>
