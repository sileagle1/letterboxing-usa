Box :  George's Bane<br/>
Date Placed: 10/16/2002<br/>
Location:  North Bend, King County, Washington<br/>
<br/>
Clue:<br/>
Head east on I-90<br/>
Go one Exit past the Seattle East Truck Stop<br/>
You will have passed unknowingly over the South Fork of the Snoqualmie as it rushes to Twin Falls<br/>
At the Exit go right at the stop sign then right again into the Parking Lot.<br/>
Hike up to the Railroad grade and head West down the grade.<br/>
Pick up the trail on the left just before Pole 1313.<br/>
Up up up 45 minutes at 45 year old farts pace to the Y<br/>
Climbers go straight and Hikers to the Owl Spot go Right.<br/>
We follow the climbers and are soon skirting a rock face on your right.<br/>
Ignore the first trail to the right while you are skirting along the cliff<br/>
and take the second right shortly after the trail leaves the rock  and jogs left.<br/>
Follow this trail to a climbing rock and great views.<br/>
Pick up the trail again skirting the west base of the rock and follow it up towards  the top<br/>
of the climbing rock.  After scrambling up to the top notice the rock ridge continueing upward.<br/>
Follow this to a cairn by a small tree.   The box is an ammo box under the tree.<br/>
