                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Like some of the recent posters to this list, I too first heard of <br/>
letterboxing by reading the article in the Sunday, September 3<br/>
edition <br/>
of the Hartford Courant.  It really excited me, I have to say,<br/>
because <br/>
I used to hike the blue trail system a few years ago, before I met my <br/>
wife.  I haven't hiked at all over the past few years, and I had <br/>
recently resolved to start again.  So this article was quite timely.<br/>
<br/>
Getting started is a tad overwhelming.  Part of it is that I want to <br/>
start right away, but I don't want to just buy a stamp off the shelf.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to carve my own.  And my wife would like to do some of the <br/>
hunts with me.  I have been to http://www.letterboxing.org, which is<br/>
an excellent site.  There, I found links to stamp-making, which will<br/>
likely be my next step.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems like Connecticut is one of the best states in which to <br/>
practice this hobby, so I feel fortunate to live here for that<br/>
reason.     <br/>
In fact, my house sits on land which shares a border with Devil's <br/>
Hopyard State Park, which has two letterboxes hidden.  It's nice to <br/>
know that I have dozens of letterboxes to explore in this state<br/>
alone. <br/>
<br/>
I do have a few questions, however:<br/>
<br/>
(1) If my wife and I jointly find the letterbox, should we stamp the <br/>
book with each of our stamps?  In other words, if X people jointly <br/>
find a letterbox, will they place X stamps in the log book?<br/>
<br/>
(2) If I decide to place letterboxes of my own, is it customary to<br/>
ask  <br/>
permission of the management of the land on which you plan to hide<br/>
the  <br/>
box? <br/>
<br/>
(3) How often should one check a letterbox one has left?  I ask this <br/>
because it seems to me a log book could fill up with stamps<br/>
relatively  <br/>
quickly, especially as the popularity of the hobby increases?<br/>
<br/>
I may have more questions later.  I just wanted to introduce myself<br/>
to  <br/>
the group.  My name is Christopher Van Loon, and I live in East <br/>
Haddam, CT.  For the record, I'm 28 years old. <br/>
<br/>
Out of curiosity, does anyone know approximately how many Connecticut <br/>
list members there are? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any advice, answers to questions, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Chris<br/>

us!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
[JayD] You could do either. There is a family from Long Island who <br/>
have one stamp for the bunch of them. Or, you could each have your <br/>
own stamp. We have six folks in my family, and all use our own <br/>
stamps. We started with store-bought, and would like to switch to <br/>
handmade, but they sort of become a "signature" that people recognize <br/>
so we haven't changed. My kids Ariel and Ned are now famous with a <br/>
picture of their personal stamps in the Courant article. They showed <br/>
that off at school their first day back!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; (2) If I decide to place letterboxes of my own, is it customary to<br/>
&gt; ask permission of the management of the land on which you plan to <br/>
hide the box? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
[JayD]That's been a question, sometimes sticky, in the past. We <br/>
figure don't ask, don't tell in general. But there is someone who got <br/>
permission from the US Park Service once. We do hope that private <br/>
property will be respected and that letterboxes will be on publicly <br/>
accessible sites.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; (3) How often should one check a letterbox one has left?  I ask <br/>
this because it seems to me a log book could fill up with stamps<br/>
&gt; relatively quickly, especially as the popularity of the hobby <br/>
increases?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
[JayD]As often as you want! I know some letterboxes have been placed <br/>
while folks are traveling and never anticipate re-visiting. Others <br/>
are orphaned for other reasons. What is probably the most-visited <br/>
letterbox in America (Elaine and Jerry's Rocks) had a filled-up <br/>
logbook, which is now on display at EMS in Waterford's Crystal Mall <br/>
(no commercial affiliation here..)<br/>
<br/>
Again, WELCOME to this wonderful hobby,<br/>

<br/>
Sure why not?  I'm oversimplifying, but one of my boxes was stamped <br/>
by a couple that each had half the stamp.  You really can pretty much<br/>
do what you feel in these regards ...<br/>

Hi Chris,  Welcome to the fun.   Just thought I'd add my advice .... #2...I <br/>
have found that it is good to get permission from community <br/>
parks....otherwise the grounds crew will likely remove the box....even when <br/>
hidden in the most un-obvious location.   Our boxes have faired much better <br/>
after receiving permission.<br/>
