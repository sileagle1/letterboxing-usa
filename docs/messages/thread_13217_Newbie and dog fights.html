                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Everyone!!  I am not really new to letterboxing, but I have yet to <br/>
actually get out there and find one!  I have been following the chat <br/>
list and website for a few months now.  I just can't seem to make <br/>
right to get outside!!  I am in CO and am also a single mom with a 3 <br/>
1/2 year-old.  I will get out there and start hunting soon.  Thanks <br/>
to Autumn for planting closer boxes for me find soon!!  I also wanted <br/>
to comment on the dog (and owner?) who got attacked by another dog.  <br/>
I am so sorry that had to happen.  (I also want to say sorry to the <br/>
other fellow letterboxers and friends that have been hurt!)  I am the <br/>
owner of a Pit-Bull/Rottweiler mix (along with German Shepard, we <br/>
think).  I have made it a point to keep her leashed at all times and <br/>
even avoid other people and dogs as well.  I have found that the more <br/>
afraid of a dog the person is, the crazier my dog gets.  My dog, <br/>
Madonna, is the sweetest thing in the world, but if she feels the <br/>
need she will have at it.  This has happened once, and only once, <br/>
when some drunk guy tried to take her away from my boyfriend while at <br/>
Red Rocks Ampitheatre.  Madonna wouldn't have it and bit the guy on <br/>
the leg, not bad, but enough to get him to let go of her.  I wanted <br/>
to let everybody know about this so that people understand (mostly <br/>
those who don't understand or like dogs) that dogs are originally <br/>
wild animals and will defend themselves (and their families) if they <br/>
feel it is necesssary.  I feel very strongly that all dogs should be <br/>
leashed when in public areas, no matter what kind of dog it is or <br/>
what the "normal" behavior is.  I know that walking down the trail <br/>
with noone really around is tempting and I usually let my dog run as <br/>
much as I can without getting in anybody's way, but still feel that <br/>
she should always be on the leash.  I just can't even walk her as <br/>
fast as she can go!!  I hear people say "Well then why do have her if <br/>
you can't exercise her how she should be exercised?".  I tell them <br/>
that I rescued her on Christmas Eve.  She was the only dog in the <br/>
pound not barking and when we took her outside to play, she went as <br/>
far away as she could and did her business and then she ran laps as <br/>
fast as she could.  I fell instantly in love with her!  I think that <br/>
some people just don't understand that control is the main thing in <br/>
having a puppy-dog.  I control her by keeping her out of situations <br/>
that could possibly be dangerous or unhealthy.  Even playing in a <br/>
fenced yard with dogs she knows can be bad.  You just never know when <br/>
a dog is not going to like someone or another dog.  OK I think I'm <br/>
done!!  I am sorry that this is so long, but need to have my say to <br/>
the group.  I hope that this doesn't offend anyone and please <br/>
remember that I just wanted to have my opinion known.  I hope to meet <br/>
some of you on the trail soon and if you happen to meet Madonna, <br/>
don't be scared, she loves to be petted and oogled over (she is a <br/>
star, ya know!!~(:  ).  I am sure I will be hearing from ya all soon!!<br/>
<br/>
Teri (thinking of "Ewok" as my trail name, anyone seen an Ewok stamp <br/>
anywhere?  Don't think I can start the carving thing anytime soon!!)<br/>
<br/>
PS  I will and get a picture of Madonna on here soon so you can see <br/>
her!! I think she is absolutely beautiful, though I am a little bit <br/>
partial!!<br/>

dog comments were in the least offensive, but then, I'm a dog lover myself,<br/>

faster.  Who judges getting dogs on that?  I don't think I know any owners<br/>
that can keep up with a dog given free range.<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried carving yet?  It really isn't as hard as it sounds.  You<br/>
don't even have to be able to draw.  Many of my carvings are made from<br/>
either tracings, clip art, copies, etc, and you can take out or add as much<br/>
detail as you like.  Just rub some polish remover onto the back of a copy or<br/>
laser print and it will transfer onto an eraser or carving material.  I was<br/>
pleasantly surprised how easy and enjoyable it can be, and they are only<br/>
getting better with practice.  Give it a try, you may like it more than you<br/>
expect.<br/>

Start hunting soon.  You will love it.  Besides, we need more of us Rocky<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi there!<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say I'm totally with you on the dog thing. It was my dog, <br/>
Nina, that got attacked. As upset as I was that she got bitten and traumatized, <br/>
I was in no way having a problem with the offending dog. The woman's dogs were <br/>
leashed and just got the better of their owner in their excitement (a shepard <br/>
and a husky). It was obvious to me from her reaction that her shepard had <br/>
never done anything like that before. All she kept saying (as I bandaged her <br/>
hands) was "I'm so sorry! He's a good dog! Really! He's a good dog!" I reassured <br/>
her that I could see that and that I wasn't going to sue her or anything. I was <br/>
patting her dogs and they were fine. She had been being responsible. They <br/>
were just too strong for her.<br/>
<br/>
I used to be a professional dog trainer myself and no matter how trained your <br/>
dog is, those unpredictable moments happen. My dog is trained, 'canine good <br/>
citizen' skills and all that, but no amount of training has made her able to <br/>
get along with other dogs. I always keep her leashed and never let her approach <br/>
other dogs, and I would always tell my students that they should keep their <br/>
dog leashed whenever there was a chance to have an encounter with other people <br/>
or animals. <br/>
<br/>
I also believe that one should also never let their dogs approach a person or <br/>
their dog without asking permission (Just like you teach your children to ask <br/>
if they may pat a stranger's dog before they approach). Some people are <br/>
afraid of dogs;others are allergic or simply don't want your dog jumping on them.  <br/>
There is nothing that annoys me more than when people just let their dogs run <br/>
up to Nina, saying "Oh he's friendly". It never seems to occur to them that <br/>
the other dog might not react well to their dog. I usually respond, "Yes, but my <br/>
dog might eat your dog." This situation the other day was simply a case of <br/>
two excited dogs who were much stronger than their small-framed owner and got <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
I would also tell my students that they should be very careful about forming <br/>
negative  opinions about certain breeds. Certainly there are breeds that have <br/>
been used for protection work, or fighting or pack hunting and their <br/>
temperament may reflect that, but there are Rottweillers that would save you from a <br/>
fire and there are tiny Pomeranians that would chew your face off. Mostly it's <br/>
the owner and how well they train and monitor their dog that's the issue. It's <br/>
easy to train most dogs. It's really hard to train a human being. Most people <br/>
don't like to hear it, but 90% of a well-trained dog is a disciplined owner who <br/>
sticks with training and doesn't slack off.<br/>
<br/>
Nina is an American Staffordshire Terrier (largest American Pitbull <br/>
breed)/Lab mix. People are always looking at her with the hairy eyeball and are worried <br/>
about the Pitbull in her. Yes, she tends to be dog-aggressive, but she is <br/>
fine with most people (no dog likes everyone). The breed is also extremely <br/>
intelligent (thank goodness she got the Amstaff brains and not the happy-go-lucky <br/>
Lab temperament) and when people see how well trained she is and how many words <br/>
she knows, they usually change their opinion right away. I have had several <br/>
self-proclaimed dog-'haters' change their tune regarding Nina.<br/>
<br/>
This experience will certainly not keep me from bringing Nina with us, and as <br/>
soon as she can wear a collar again (20 stitches on her neck and ear), she'll <br/>
be coming along.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to also post a picture of the Nina-dog soon...probably an older one <br/>
where she doesn't have shaved patches and stitches :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reminding us all that we need to love our 'babies', but also need <br/>
to be responsible doggie parents too.<br/>

       Excellent advice to others with or without dogs.  I have two boxers <br/>
(also rescue dogs) and although the male is gentler and more playful, the female <br/>
is very protective of us.  It is probably common in all females - they think <br/>
of us as their puppies, I think.  I keep them both leashed because I know not <br/>
everyone appreciates seeing an 86 lb. dog running straight at them - yikes!   <br/>
If you all see a dog that you cannot resist and want to pet, put your fist out <br/>
for them to sniff first - open hands gives them several fingers to bite if <br/>
they are inclined to do so.  Then once they realize you are not a threat, <br/>
petting is so very nice for them - they love it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks guys for all of the info and thoughts!!  I am hoping to get <br/>
out there this weekend since I will be childless for a little <br/>
while....WHOOHOO!!  Time off!!  Anyway, Autumn, I will e-mail you <br/>
soon and we will work out some time to go do some boxes.  Still don't <br/>
know about the stamp carving thing.  I will have to practice, <br/>
practice, practice!!  Just looking at some of the stamps on the talk <br/>
list and various websites makes me a little nervous as I have never <br/>
really been that artistic!!  Oh well!!  I am sure I can look high &amp; <br/>
low for an Ewok stamp and probably never find an exact.  Ewok has <br/>
been my nickname since high school and I have one tatooed on my <br/>
thigh, so at least I will always have a picture of one and don't have <br/>
look for one of those!!  It took me 2 weeks of bookstore/specialty <br/>
store shopping to find a picture that I could use for the tatoo.  I <br/>
think the picture would have to be similar to one used for a tatoo <br/>
for carving purposes.  Well, I will be off now!!  Talk to ya'all <br/>
soon!!<br/>

<br/>
I found an ewok picture for you on Google image search.  I saved it <br/>
to the files section as what else - ewok.  The trick for me is to <br/>
find a black and white graphic with simple and clear lines.  Then I <br/>
just put the picture upside down on the "pink stuff" and dab it with <br/>
nailpolish remover (acetone) and wah lah there is the picture.  <br/>
(some printers output work better than others - I think laser print <br/>
is better than inkjet) As long as you have the speedball carver set <br/>
you will be amazed at how easy it is. Good close vision and a steady <br/>
are definitely helpful!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Could you take a picture of your tattoo and use that to carve your<br/>
stamp?  (Assuming you don't still have original from which it was done.)<br/>
Take it with a digital camera or scan the printed picture.  Once you<br/>
have it in file format, you can re-size it, change it to black and white<br/>
or gray-scale.  There are excellent websites on how to use pictures to<br/>
make stamps.<br/>

Still don't <br/>
know about the stamp carving thing.  I will have to practice, <br/>
practice, practice!!  Just looking at some of the stamps on the talk <br/>
list and various websites makes me a little nervous as I have never <br/>
really been that artistic!!  Oh well!!  I am sure I can look high &amp; <br/>
low for an Ewok stamp and probably never find an exact.  Ewok has <br/>
been my nickname since high school and I have one tatooed on my <br/>
thigh, so at least I will always have a picture of one and don't have <br/>
look for one of those!!  It took me 2 weeks of bookstore/specialty <br/>
store shopping to find a picture that I could use for the tatoo.  I <br/>
think the picture would have to be similar to one used for a tatoo <br/>
for carving purposes.  Well, I will be off now!!  Talk to ya'all <br/>
soon!!<br/>
