Basically I stamp onto frosted Shrinky Dink material, sometimes<br/>
coloring in with colored pencils. I then punch a hole with a regular<br/>
hole punch, cut the whole thing out, curves work best and bake it. <br/>
Then I thread 2 6mm split rings [found at michaels jewelery section, I<br/>
wish they were a bit larger] onto the hole so it dangles nicely and<br/>
then I usually thread some ribbon onto it and tie it to a small<br/>
certificate done in gel pens saying something like congratulations!<br/>
I also often attatch one onto the logbook cause it is just so cool!<br/>
[for those people who are not first finders to look at.] There is<br/>
something about miniatures that just warms my heart.<br/>
Maybe this could start a trend????????? But credit goes to my 12 year<br/>
old daughter who thought of it first!<br/>
