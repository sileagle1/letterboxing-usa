<br/>
Could somebody explain to me a series? My impression is that it is a <br/>
grouping of similarly related letterboxes (i.e. same theme or similar <br/>
location, etc). Are the boxes in the series all placed by the same <br/>
person? Is there a stamp in each box? Are the stamps each different <br/>
or the same with a different numeric denotation?<br/>
<br/>
What is it called when the beginning clues (i.e. those posted on the <br/>
web site) only lead to a box with further clues to a box which may or <br/>
may not be the end goal (perhaps just another step in the clue <br/>
process)? In this situation, would each of the intermediary boxes <br/>
contain a stamp, or just the final box? I have a wonderful idea for <br/>
this type of "stepping stone" box.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I was wondering about placing boxes indoors, for instance <br/>
inside a pub. Of course, I would have the buy-in of the establishment <br/>
owner, but what else is there to consider? If anyone has planted <br/>
similar boxes, I would appreciate any tips and/or a link to the <br/>
clues, to get a feel for how you went about it.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, what is a letterbook? I've noticed it referred to a few <br/>
times, but just when I thought I knew what it was, the next reference <br/>
didn't fit?<br/>

I am glad to jump in regarding two of your questions. We do have several<br/>
examples of indoor boxes. My impression is that pub boxes are quite common<br/>
in Dartmoor. I hid a pub box prior to the first northeast gathering in the<br/>
fall of 1999. It is not in place at the moment, but the clues are posted at<br/>
http://www.sover.net/~tcooch/mcgrath.htm<br/>
<br/>
You definitely want to get the permission and cooperation of the owner. I<br/>
did initially, but I don't think he was seriously committed to the project,<br/>
not understanding much about the hobby. I suspect some assistant found the<br/>
box while cleaning, and dumped it in the trash.<br/>
<br/>
How you write the clues is up to you. There would seem to be many ways to go<br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
Ditto for letterbooks, in which the box is a book which has been<br/>
hollowed-out. You can see two examples of letterbooks at<br/>
http://www.sover.net/~tcooch/kimball.htm and<br/>
http://www.ocpl.lib.ny.us/website/letterbook.htm<br/>

Yes, a series has a common theme or are in close proximity to each other.

Usually, but sometimes a few boxers team up to do a series.

<p><br/>There is always a stamp in a letterbox (except for a very few that
have stickers)

<p><br/>As far as I know, all boxes have stamps and, in a series, the final
box is special.  In Sherburne, Vermont there is a 2 part series that
requires finding both stamps to gain a complete image.  Each stamp
provides half the "picture".  This is common in England, particularly
for charity events.

<p><br/>Yes!  For our first east coast meeting, Tom Cooch confounded
us all for quite some hours with a pub search.  It was great fun,
the clues answers were found in the clippings and posters on the pub wall.

<p><br/>Letterbook, Kimball Library, Randolph, Vermont, again Tom Cooch
showed ingenuity and provided a wintertime box which is really important
in the North.
</p><p>Enjoy!
