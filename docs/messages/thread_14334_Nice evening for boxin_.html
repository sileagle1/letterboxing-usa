and I drove over to Chillicothe and found Salamander's "Taking Stock <br/>
#2" and "Unlocking The Clues boxes."  Both were in great shape and <br/>
well worth the trip as we've come to expect from her.  We also took a <br/>
stab at her "Stars In His Eyes" mystery box but came up empty.  We'll <br/>
have to think about that one some more.  A great way to spend an <br/>
evening.<br/>
