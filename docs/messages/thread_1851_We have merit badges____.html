                    <div class="plaintext-content">HI everyone.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the letterboxers on the list suggested the possibility of having a <br/>
group of merit badges made on one piece of cloth and cutting them off as you <br/>
earned them.  At Valerie's suggestion I looked into it.<br/>
I spoke to the embroidery shop about a price for that since the individual <br/>
merit badges were so pricey ($10 each with a one time $65 set up fee.). I <br/>
just got a quote from the shop.    Doing that brings the cost of the merit <br/>
badges way down!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the deal:  any denomination merit badge (X, P, F) will be $4 <br/>
(includes tax).<br/>
The merit badge will be a shown on the current order form.  With colors to <br/>
match the patches just ordered.  Orange background, blue &amp; green.<br/>
<br/>
  As soon as I receive orders for 40 merit badges, the set up fee will be <br/>
covered and I will be able to send the order in.   After the first order goes <br/>
in we can post an additional *merit badges only* order form on the LbNA site <br/>
for orders of 10 at a time.<br/>
<br/>
To avoid confusion with Valerie Logo patch and decal order I don't won't to <br/>
post an order form yet.   This merit badge order will be totally separate <br/>
from the order Valerie is making.<br/>
If you are interested send your order to:<br/>
<br/>
Kay  Mohmers<br/>
112 Dale Ave<br/>
Collinsville IL 62234<br/>
<br/>
With a self addressed stamped envelope.<br/>
<br/>
$4 per merit badge ... clearly specify the quantity and the denomination.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a question just send a note to me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting<br/>

<br/>
Can you clarify this?  Does this mean specifically the denomonations<br/>
currently listed on the form?  If there is flexibility here, it makes<br/>
sense to do 500's and 1000's now as well.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
