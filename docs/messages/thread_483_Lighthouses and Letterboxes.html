&gt; Now as for actual letterboxing news, I just went on<br/>
&gt;  the annual Door County Lighthouse Walk and scouted<br/>
&gt;  tons of locations for my forthcoming series of boxes. <br/>
&gt;  I plan to get at about 5-10 of them out this summer. <br/>
<br/>
  Great! We're tentatively planning a long summer weekend<br/>
in Door County. The plan will have to include the Ephraim<br/>
public beach, (and Wilson's ice cream, naturally...), and<br/>
some lighthouse letterboxes!<br/>
  The lighthouse walk was featured in the Madison newspaper<br/>
last weekend, and one of the lighthouses pictured was the<br/>
Sand Island Lighthouse. Love at first sight!<br/>
  Found the lighthouse keeper's journal online.... <br/>
  Also have postcard from a stamp co. called Gray Wolf<br/>
Graphics in South Haven Michigan, which features light-house<br/>
stamps ~ I'm sending for the catalog... want to know if they <br/>
have any Door Co. lighthouse stamps?<br/>
  Official Letterboxing Business: I move that Door Co., WI,<br/>
be elected as the official midwest hub for letterboxing.<br/>
Reason #`1 - Here's my fact of the day... unearthed when looking <br/>
up info for a school project; there is more shoreline in Door Co. than<br/>
any other county in the U.S.!<br/>
Reason #2 -  http://www.travelwisconsin.com/tour/doorcounty.shtml<br/>
Reason #3 - We honeymooned there in 1981! (I remember what we<br/>
saw at the Penninsula Players Theatre, Neil Simon's "I Ought to Be<br/>
in Pictures", later made into a movie starring Walter Matthau and <br/>
Dinah Manoff (sp?)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;(Any new letterboxes waiting in the wings, Deborah?)<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah! in the works, really! <br/>
I admit it, though.... I NEED to wait for drier weather here...<br/>
I am official "Ms. Mosquito Magnet" for 20 years running....<br/>

I, on the other hand, am usually ignored by mosquitos.....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Cool idea, Deborah, but I think a midwest letterboxing<br/>
mecca should have more than just two letterboxers in<br/>
it!  So far I've got all these boxes out, and more to<br/>
come, and very few letterbox hunters.  Perhaps when<br/>
the tourist flood hits Door Co. there will be some<br/>
letterboxers among the masses.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you find any lighthouse stamps, but<br/>
right now I'm doing my best to carve stamps based on<br/>
my photos.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting this summer, and let me know if you want<br/>
to borrow some bug spray.<br/>
