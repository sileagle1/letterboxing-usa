  Your stamp is fantastic too! That was really your first carving? I am<br/>
really bad I fear. I think I'm recarving my effort for the exchange. I knew<br/>
scout dog's would look like a manufactured stamp, but ALL the stamps are so<br/>
great, and mine is, well, pitiful! So it's back to the drawing board,<br/>
eraser, and exacto for me.<br/>

NO EXACTO KNIVES!  Catbead gave me some excellent carving advice - <br/>
and that was to avoid Exacto knives because she knew I'd cut my <br/>
fingers off.<br/>
<br/>
I instead went out and bought Speedball carving tools (NO HANDLE) <br/>
number 1, 2, 3, 5, and the blade.  Best thing I ever did.<br/>
<br/>
I made my stamp by drawing the outline of a Magic Rub eraser on a <br/>
piece of paper.  I then sketched in the symbol of the Methodist <br/>
Church.  Then I colored in the sketch with a dark pencil.  I pressed <br/>
the Magic Rub eraser onto the image.  Then using the Speedball <br/>
carving tools, I whittled away all the white on the surface of the <br/>
eraser, and left the pencil transfered image alone.  I didn't realize <br/>
how crude it was until I went to use it.  What you see is my attempt <br/>
#4.<br/>
