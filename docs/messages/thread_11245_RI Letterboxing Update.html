                    <html><body>Joe from Manchester and I ventured out to RI today to enjoy the wonderful warm day!  We started off with the Wizard of Oz series, which we were only partially successful for.  We were having great luck with the first three boxes in the series (since the clues were kind of cryptic concerning the trails we were supposed to be on).  We got to the Tin Man, and his hiding place (or what we think is the hiding place... the trees in question were obvious) was full of ice and glacial snow.  Of course, as you know, the series is eight boxes, with the clues to each box in the previous one, so that ended our Wizard hunt for the day.  Stupid me forgot the Up North/Down South (?) clues in the car, but Wanda saved the day by reminding me at another box that the Carolina South box was in the area (actually gave pretty good clues too... we did find it!).  Then we went and did Bobbin' Bobber, A Fishing Hole, and Day of the Dragon King series, Quint. Quonnie, Cross Mills Public Library Quest, and Nibiru, all of which were in good shape (at least I think so for the last three, since I stayed in the car while Joe stamped in, since I already have them). 
<br/>
<br/>All in all, 10 boxes for me, and 9 for Joe (he already had Dragon King series... but kind of forgot until we got to the first box!  I felt SO bad!  However, he had forgot to sign into the boxes the first time with his red overlap stamp (only stamping in with the background stamp) with his name on it, so it wasn't a total loss for him... he fixed the error in all of the boxes!

<br/>Happy Hunting Everyone!

asked "Are you following the Yellow Brick Road?" to the two people <br/>
we came across at the Kenyon Cemetary on Sunday. We mentioned how <br/>
icy/muddy the trail was the way we had came. They moved on and we <br/>
stamped into the Down South letterbox, right after Music Woman and <br/>
Joe!  We assume that was who we had just spoke with.  From now on we <br/>
will always make an enquiry to see if who we run across on the <br/>
trails are fellow Letterboxers.  We could have had our first stamp <br/>
exchange!  <br/>
