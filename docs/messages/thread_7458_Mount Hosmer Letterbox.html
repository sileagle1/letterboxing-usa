Lettterbox name:  Mount Hosmer Letterbox<br/>
Date placed:  August 26, 2002<br/>
Lansing, Iowa, USA<br/>
The terrain is steep in places, requires some moderate, but short<br/>
hiking. Mount Hosmer is not open to vehicles in the winter.<br/>
<br/>
A new letterbox has been hidden! It is located in northeast Iowa on the<br/>
Mississippi River in the town of Lansing, Iowa on top of Mount Hosmer,<br/>
the city park.<br/>
<br/>
Clues to find it:<br/>
<br/>
    To find the Mount Hosmer Letterbox, go to the top of Mount Hosmer<br/>
(you can drive or walk).  When you have reached the very top, walk<br/>
towards the river view and the flag pole.  When you have reached the<br/>
flag pole and are facing the river, follow the chain link fence to your<br/>
right to the end of the fence.  There will be a small path into the<br/>
woods there....follow it . (It is steep and rocky in places) When the<br/>
path starts to branch out (approx. 96 paces from the fence), take the<br/>
furthest left branch and follow it along the rock outcropping along the<br/>
face of the bluff about 20 paces.  You will see a large crevasse in the<br/>
rock to your left and a butternut tree.  Continue about 3 or 4 more<br/>
steps along the rock face...bend down and in front of you at ground<br/>
level will be a small hole with a rock and some leaves covering up the<br/>
letterbox.  Happy Hunting!<br/>
