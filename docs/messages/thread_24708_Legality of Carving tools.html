And even if there were, does anyone think that our hobby will even appear on their radar?  Doubtful.  I believe the H users and crack heads are significantly more important than a bunch of wackos who carve rubber with needles.  I actually think that they would think that we are wasting all of the clean needles for the junkies out there.  I think that, if anything, would be their concern.  Aside from that, carve away.  I don't think big brother is watching, and if he was, he's changed the channel by now!!!!<br/>
