                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi folks!  We want to let everyone who is interested know that we <br/>
will be hosting an event on Cape Cod on Saturday, October 4th at <br/>
Nickerson State Park in Brewster.  The event, henceforth known <br/>
as "The Cape Caper" will (hopefully) take place in one of the <br/>
pavilions in the park.  The wrinkle is that we have to "grab" a <br/>
pavilion on the morning of the event, as we can not reserve it.  <br/>
Nevertheless, we will be camping there and will take a large tarp, <br/>
etc. for contingencies if we have to set up in an open picnic <br/>
ground.  If interested, please let us know for planning purposes.  <br/>
Please plan to bring a salad, dessert, soup, or other dish to share.  <br/>
We will provide some soda, plates, utensils, etc.  You can reserve a <br/>
camping site at the park online -- we are planning to stay in the <br/>
area around Cliff Pond (area 6 or 6x).  There are currently 43 <br/>
letterboxes posted on the Cape, and there will be more by the day of <br/>
the Event (including an Event stamp and special event-only boxes).  <br/>
Sun, fun, exchanges and Cape Cod.  What else can you want?<br/>
