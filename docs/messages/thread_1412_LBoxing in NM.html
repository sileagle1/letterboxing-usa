If you log onto the letterbox.org page, you will see that one letterbox is hidden in New Mexico. This was hidden by someone (who was that fleeting figure???) who was visiting your beautiful state last year.  <br/>
<br/>
I would like to encourage you to plant boxes in your state. The southwestern section of the US (Calif included) is lagging far behind the East Coast! Being one of a sparse few in Northern California, I know how lonely this hobby can be--but (I've been told) if you hide them, they will come.<br/>

&gt;Hi Carol,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I joined the group tonight, I live in New Mexico, is that one of the <br/>
&gt;states you are missing?  If it is I would be glad to hide a box.  If <br/>
&gt;New Mexico is not missing could you put me in touch with someone from <br/>
&gt;my state.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks Kay<br/>
