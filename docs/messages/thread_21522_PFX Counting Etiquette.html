Hi Jiggs,<br/>
I'm not sure about all of those and how you would count them, but <br/>
you listed a find at AQ on "Gold Strike" that was north of Ketchum, <br/>
Idaho. I think you thought it was "Gold Strike" that was at the end <br/>
of our driveway during the Kernville White Water Letterboxing Event. <br/>
It is the same stamp , but different location. We didn't keep the <br/>
driveway letterbox, nor did we post the clues. Hope you guys are <br/>
thawing out.<br/>
Don <br/>

I have been wrestling with this very same quandry.  I have about 12 <br/>
real exchanges (ie. met in person) and some exchanges from my Happy <br/>
Birthday Letterbox surprise.  I have decided to separate those <br/>
exchanges to me as MX's (miscellaneous exchanges) since I didn't <br/>
actually meet these letterboxes on the trail, yet!  Or perhaps they <br/>
should be OX's (other exchanges, or hugs and kisses?)  I imagine I <br/>
will eventually have MP's for miscellaneous plants, but never <br/>
miscellaneous finds.<br/>
<br/>
Anything goes,<br/>
