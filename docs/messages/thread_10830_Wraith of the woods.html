Matthew,<br/>
Are you sure you are looking in the right location? <br/>
There is more than one, and closer examination of the site might prove to<br/>
be a better course than asking someone other than the box hider to have the<br/>
clue removed. <br/>
Glad to see that l'boxing is finally picking up in Austin.<br/>
Have you found the 'gordian knot' letterbox yet?<br/>

I can't really change the clues much, but I can make a suggestion - <br/>
You don't really need a GPS to find these boxes (or most geocaches <br/>
for that matter). Both clues use coordinates to get you to the <br/>
general area where you begin but not(knot) the location of the boxes <br/>
themselves. Using the cordinates and some standard USGS 7.5 minute <br/>
quadrangle maps you should be able to get close enough to the <br/>
starting points. You'll need to convert the coordinates from WGS84 to <br/>
NAD27 to use the maps. Several online converters are available. I use <br/>
the one at jeep.com. You can get USGS maps online from several <br/>
locations also. These sites will generate a map around a set of <br/>
coordinates you input so you can save yourself the hassle of figuring <br/>
out which maps to buy that way. Locally, you can buy the print <br/>
versions at Miller Blueprint Company on 6th Street.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Also looking forward to going after your Mystery Box after you <br/>
&gt; replant it.  I did not find it back in late December, though I'm <br/>

<br/>
It was probably already gone at that time. I've put a note on the <br/>
clue page letting people know it is gone until I can replace it, <br/>
probably no earlier than September.<br/>
