                    <div class="plaintext-content">On August 24, 2002 Funhog placed the Avery's Pond Letterbox near Auburn,<br/>
Placer County, California. This hike is just over a mile each way through<br/>
oak woodlands along the edge of Folsom Lake. You may be lucky enough to<br/>
spot one of my favorite birds amongst the trees, an Acorn Woodpecker. Bring<br/>
your lunch and a set of colored markers.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: you can approach this trail from either Highway 50 or<br/>
I-84 (closer) via Auburn Folsom Road which runs between Old Town Auburn and<br/>
Rainbow Bridge in Folsom. From Auburn Folsom Road, turn onto Rattlesnake<br/>
Bar Road, following the signs for Folsom Lake. In the summer months, there<br/>
is a small day use fee ($2) Once past the pay station, keep left towards<br/>
the boat ramp. At the far end of the first parking area there is a concrete<br/>
path to the outhouses. The trail begins just behind.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: Cross a dirt road, continuing uphill. Go right at the T.<br/>
Standing between pond and lake you will spot a roof at 200 degrees and an<br/>
electric tower at 235 magnetic. The letterbox is behind you near the base<br/>
of a tall stump under a chunk of loose wood.<br/>
