Diego or will be visiting soon, I would appreciate it if you<br/>
could check on my San Diego Sails Letterbox for me since<br/>
I don't live there.  I just got an email from a non-letterboxer<br/>
that found the box because it had not been covered up well by the<br/>
last visitor.  Please re-cover with a log or dead wood so<br/>
it is no longer visible.  I'm afraid somebody will mistake<br/>
it for trash and throw it away.  The good news is that the<br/>
person who found it may now become a new Letterboxer!<br/>

Thanks,<br/>
