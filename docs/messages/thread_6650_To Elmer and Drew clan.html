they are a fleeting fancy and gone. Take this from one who has <br/>
survived to tell and enjoyed it all the ups and downs the fashion and <br/>
the frenzy and now it is gone. in four years it will return for a <br/>
brief  time here . My kids now 9,20,22,24  the three older girls and <br/>
9 is Cowboy . So keep smiling because that way they can't figure you <br/>
out! Leader of the Pack  p.s. Pink Trotters hs recently taken on the <br/>
letterboxing bug and decided this wasn't a crazy Mom thing after all. <br/>
