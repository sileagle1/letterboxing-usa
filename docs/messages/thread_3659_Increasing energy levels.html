<b> Here is a sample of just a few of the letters we receive every week <br/>
thanking us for what our product has done:</b>

<b> </b>
<b> <br/>
<br/>
</b>

<b> "I am astounded! The day before I started taking the GH1, <br/>
I took blood tests. Then I began using the GH1 as directed. <br/>
After 8 weeks I took blood tests again. <br/>
My IGF-1 level (evidence of GH) showed a 70% increase! <br/>
Furthermore, my cholesterol score went from 190 down to 144! <br/>
I definitely feel better overall and certainly have more energy. <br/>
To say the least I am very impressed and pleased with GH1. <br/>
My "biological" age is now that of a 40 year old!" <br/>
-Dr. A. Zuckerman M.D., age 60, NY <br/>
<br/>
"A year ago, my blood pressure was 180/120 and I was on blood <br/>
pressure medication. I also started the Anti-Aging formula, GH1. <br/>
After a year on the product, my blood pressure is now 120/80-- <br/>
and I haven't been on the blood pressure medication for months!" <br/>
-Susanne Peters, Laguna Beach, CA <br/>
<br/>
"After 2 weeks on Anti-Aging Formula GH1, I noticed a higher <br/>
level of energy, increased sexual energy and my memory and vision <br/>
were enhanced. My blood pressure is down to 126/84 after workout-and <br/>
it seems every other day I have to 'rev-up' the amps on the treadmill <br/>
at the gym. I've noticed a tightening of the skin under my chin and <br/>
a change in my lungs with much easier breathing. After 4 months, <br/>
I only need 5 hours sleep instead of 7. One morning, I had to do an extra <br/>
karate workout just to expend all the extra energy!" "After 6 months on <br/>
GH1, my blood sugar levels went from 130 down to 65! Also, my stamina has <br/>
increased, as well as my energy and sex drive--this product is GREAT!" <br/>
-Dr. Richard Boyd, 78 years old, Harvard Clinical Psychologist, CA <br/>
<br/>
"As a straight-ahead bicycle racer, I used to have to wait a minute <br/>
and a half after sprinting, for my heart rate to come down to where <br/>
I could sprint again. After a month on GH1, I can now sprint again <br/>
after only 45 seconds! GH1 cut my waiting time in half!" <br/>
-Ed Caz, age 40, Fresno,CA <br/>
<br/>
"When I heard GH1 would reduce body fat increase lean muscle WITHOUT EXERCISE, I couldn't believe it--but in just a few months I lost 4 inches around my waist without exercising and my body fat went from 22 down to 19--even though I gained 10 pounds! Also, after 4 months, my fine vision returned I no longer need the magnifying glasses to read fine print." <br/>
-Larry Baker, age 54,Oceanside, CA <br/>
<br/>
"I have been taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 for five months now. <br/>
I have been under great stress in my business. <br/>
I believe that taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 has had a big part in keeping <br/>
my energy level up and having the strength to stay positive in the midst <br/>
of discouraging circumstances. Last week I came down with a cold. <br/>
Colds are tough on me and seem to run their course- headaches, sinus inflammation, and then throat. I am progressing through those stages but more quickly than before. Hallelujah! My eyes aren't as puffy and the skin on my hands snaps back faster. <br/>
My muscles seem to have better tone-I notice it in my legs-and I have more energy <br/>
when I go out walking." <br/>
- Carolyn Munn <br/>
<br/>
"I was taking injections of GH for over one year. A friend suggested that <br/>
I try Anti-Aging Formula GH1, since I was spending 1,000 US dollars a month and needed <br/>
a doctor to inject it daily. In 2-3 weeks I felt better from the Anti-Aging <br/>
Formula GH1 than the whole time I was getting the injections. <br/>
Thank you Anti-Aging Formula for greatly helping to improve my life!" <br/>
-Rita Mills McCoy <br/>
<br/>
"I have had elevated cholesterol levels since the first time I was tested, <br/>
in my twenties. I was on Anti-Aging Formula GHI for only 1 month when my levels <br/>
dropped from 245 to 210. I could hardly believe it! After 3 months on Anti-Aging <br/>
Formula GH1 my gray hair began to darken at the roots, returning to its normal <br/>
coloring. I have even been able to reduce my thyroid medication. All of this <br/>
without having to change anything else about my lifestyle, other than taking <br/>
few sprays of Anti-Aging Formula GH1 a day. Wow! <br/>
-Alan Ross, 43 years old <br/>
<br/>
GH1 is the highest concentration of orally administered GH1 <br/>
available on the market today. Injections of GH taken in international units are usually prescribed to be taken as a shot, two times per day. The individual would be taking between 2 and 4 units per day. GH1 has over 2000ng per dosage and was created to imitate the body's natural secretion of GH <br/>

<b> WHAT IS GROWTH HORMONE (GH)?</b>

<b> <br/>
<br/>
Growth hormone is a naturally occurring substance in the human body which <br/>
is secreted by the pituitary, the master gland of the body, located in the <br/>
endocrine system. GH is a microscopic protein substance that is chemically <br/>
similar to insulin, which is secreted in short pulses during the first few <br/>
hours of sleep and after exercise. GH is one of the most abundant hormones <br/>
secreted, influencing growth of cells, bones, muscles and organs throughout <br/>
the body. Production of GH peaks at adolescence. <br/>
<br/>
Every three years approximately 90% of the cells in the human body are newly made. <br/>
The body is composed of more than 100 trillion cells that are continuously <br/>
dying and regenerating. The brain and the nervous system retain their original <br/>
cells; however, in the brain new proteins are continuously being produced to <br/>
store memories of every new experience. Overall intelligence and the ability <br/>
to learn and memorize all depend on adequate growth hormone. <br/>
<br/>
Growth hormone replacement therapy is now available to reverse age-related symptoms, including wrinkling of the skin, increased body fat, decreased muscle mass, increased cholesterol, decreased stamina and energy, decreased mental function and loss of libido. <br/>
When growth hormone falls below normal levels, supplementation offers the <br/>
all-natural potential for great benefit. Growth hormone is an amazing substance <br/>
which is safe and effective with no known side effects, if taken in the <br/>
proper dosage amounts. <br/>
<br/>
GH is one of many endocrine hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, <br/>
melatonin and DHEA, that all decline in production as we age. Hormones are tiny <br/>
chemical messengers continuously secreted in the bloodstream in order to regulate <br/>
the activities of the vital organs. The word "hormone" is derived from a Greek word <br/>
meaning to stimulate. Many of these hormones can be replaced to deter some of the <br/>
effects of aging; however, GH reaches far beyond the scope of these other <br/>
hormones. Not only does it prevent biological aging, but it acts to greatly <br/>
reverse a broad range of signs and symptoms associated with aging, including <br/>
making the skin more elastic and causing wrinkles to disappear. GH also <br/>
helps restore hair color and hair loss. <br/>
</b>

<b> <br/>
THE ETERNAL FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH?</b>

<b> <br/>
<br/>
Our bodies naturally produce GH in abundance when we are young, and its production <br/>
gradually slows over time. The amount of GH after the age of 21 falls about 14% per <br/>
decade, so that its production is reduced in half by age 60. While GH is not new, <br/>
its availability as a supplement has been limited. Specialized clinics and physicians <br/>
have been using GH for over 30 years on thousands of patients with consistent results. <br/>
Unfortunately, due to the high costs previously associated with GH, only the medical <br/>
profession and the wealthy have been privy to its benefits. Another problem has been <br/>
that the large GH molecule, composed of 191 amino acids (protein), had been only <br/>
effective administered through injections. However, a new technology developed by <br/>
Anti-Aging Inc., now makes GH an effective, affordable and convenient alternative. <br/>
</b>

<b> <br/>
</b>

<b> GH production falls by 80% from age 21 to 61 <br/>
<br/>
Growth hormone declines with age in every animal species that has been tested to date. <br/>
The amount of decline in humans falls approximately 14% per decade. <br/>
This results in the growth hormone production rate being reduced in half by the age <br/>
of 60. Humans produce on a daily basis 500 micrograms per year at age 20, <br/>
200 micrograms at age 40 and 25 micrograms at 80 years of age. Between the ages <br/>
of 70 and 80, nearly everyone is deficient in growth hormone which results in SDS, <br/>
or Somatotrophin Deficiency Syndrome. These symptoms are part of the disease called <br/>
aging which the medical community has determined is not a normal occurrence. <br/>
Healing ability and energy levels decrease, as does physical mobility. <br/>
Those who want to maintain their youthful vitality and stamina should include <br/>
an effective growth hormone therapy as part of their health regimen. <br/>
<br/>
After numerous clinical studies, the following was determined <br/>
after 6 or more months of GH therapy: <br/>
</b>
<b> _ Improved memory <br/>
_ Regenerating of the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys and other organs <br/>
_ Increased sexual drive and performance <br/>
_ Increased fertility <br/>
_ Enhanced immune system <br/>
_ Quicker wound and fracture healing <br/>
_ New hair growth and color reparation <br/>
_ Sharper vision <br/>
_ Improved exercise performance and tolerance <br/>
_ Increased muscle mass without exercise <br/>
_ Reduction of cellulite and fat <br/>
_ Increased stamina and vitality <br/>
_ Reduction in high blood pressure <br/>
_ Improvement in sleep <br/>
_ Anti-aging <br/>
_ Wrinkle reduction and smoothing <br/>
_ Decrease in LDL (bad) cholesterol <br/>
_ Increase in HDL (good) cholesterol <br/>
_ Strengthening of bones <br/>
</b>

</b>
<b> IS GH SAFE?</b>

<b> </b>
<b> <br/>
GH has been successfully used in the medical community <br/>
for over thirty years and has been studies for over 60 years. <br/>
Edmond Klein, M.D. and L. Cas Terry Ph.D., tested over <br/>
800 individuals and reported in their 1995 study that <br/>
GH had substantial benefits and no side effects.</b>
