Please do not let my computer incompetence deter you from looking for these letterboxes. They are truly located in a wonderful area that has incredible scenery in any season.<br/>
<br/>
These letterboxes are hidden in one of our favorite hiking trails behind Lake Compounce located on the Bristol/Southington town line.<br/>
The first two letterboxes are fairly easy to find. The trail is moderately difficult only due to the climbing over roots and rocks in the trail. Total hiking time one way is approx. 1 hour depending on how much time you spend viewing the bountiful scenery. <br/>
