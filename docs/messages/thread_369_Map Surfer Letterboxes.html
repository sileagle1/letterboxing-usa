Map Surfer = aka. PA Randy Hall.  And I'm starting to like<br/>
it the more I think about it.  There's a method to his madness.<br/>
Randy, your not a square peg in a round hole after all!<br/>
<br/>
Here's how it goes.  First of all, if you want an easy find,<br/>
don't go to Map Surfer clues.  If you do want a challenging<br/>
find which may require working some maps (either on the web,<br/>
on this site, or independently) well just look for a question<br/>
mark on our maps.  That is going to be the symbol used for these.<br/>
The lat. long. behind this question mark will more than likely<br/>
be no more specific than a region or county where the point<br/>
being sought is located.<br/>
<br/>
So, these will be challenging and could be a lot of fun I think.<br/>
<br/>
I've contacted the Tiger map people and hopefully I will be able<br/>
to convince them to include a question mark as one of the standard<br/>
symbols available for inclusion in their automated maps. If so, at<br/>
some point if you were to want to generate this type of letterbox<br/>
page it may be as simple as specifying (only the county) and then <br/>
specifying a "?" as the identifying symbol.  Of course you would<br/>
write your clues accordingly based not on a specific locale/direction<br/>
but rather the riddle/design you based the hunt on.  This could<br/>
have compass bearings but would not be limited to them.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know Randy.  Am I getting this?  You tell me.  I don't<br/>
want to bastardize the description of map surfer type clues.<br/>
I think other people may want to do this or something similar<br/>
to create a challenging type of letterbox hunt.  This is sort<br/>
of on the other end from the "Turn right on shore drive, get<br/>
out of your car, walk 10 paces then 18" to your right, under<br/>
the big rock" type of clue.  Those are cool too, but a map surfer<br/>
stamp imprint I think will be like a badge of honor!<br/>

<br/>
Well, I wouldn't say that.  I received a comment in one of my boxes from<br/>
a kid that said "make it harder next time" :-).  I will also be placing<br/>
some where the directions to the start are clear and explicit in<br/>
the future.  I will be placing some that are harder and some that<br/>
are easier.  It sort of depends on what the location has to offer,<br/>
and whether I want to emphasize finding the location.  For example,<br/>
Maryland's Eastern Shore is one of the most beautiful places on the<br/>
east coast, IMO, so I designed that one sort of with the whole greater<br/>
area in mind.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I've contacted the Tiger map people and hopefully I will be able<br/>

<br/>
That would be really handy.  Then my scheme of generating the maps from<br/>
a database automatically would work, mabye.  I do have some ideas on<br/>
how forms, databases, and maps can all be integrated, but it requires <br/>
at least 3 symbols the way I see it, a symbol that pinpoints the box, <br/>
or a symbol that pinpoints the start, or a vague thing like a "?". <br/>
