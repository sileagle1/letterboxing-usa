<br/>
After the activity on the LBNA talklist since Friday, I have thought <br/>
about it all weekend and Sue &amp; I decided to start a new Yahoo Group <br/>
where new letterboxers could ask any of the questions on their minds, <br/>
without clogging up the big list with repetitive questions. <br/>
<br/>
I encourage both established and new letterboxers to join so we will <br/>
have a good mix of experts and new boxers; the first group to answer <br/>
questions and lend help and the second group to ask the questions. <br/>
<br/>
This list in no way is meant to cirmvent any of the established <br/>
letterboxing lists but to serve as a vehicle by which those new to <br/>
letterboxing can ask a question or comment on letterboxing as their <br/>
skills develop. Maybe we can keep the LBNA list freer of these <br/>
questions and still offer a venue for the new boxers.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - and don't forget . . . <br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
