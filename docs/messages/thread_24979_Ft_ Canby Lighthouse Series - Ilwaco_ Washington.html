John and I checked on this letterbox series on Sunday, December 7.  <br/>
Contrary to the reports that these boxes were missing I'm happy to say <br/>
they are alive and well with some minor changes.  Thanks so much to <br/>
the letterboxer who let me know the container was cracked. The Cape <br/>
Disappointment Lighthouse letterbox was where it should be, but needed <br/>
a new container.  The container has been replaced and is back in <br/>
action. <br/>
<br/>
The North Head Lighthouse letterbox was where it should be and was in <br/>
good condition, but the clues needed an overhaul as the environment <br/>
has changed and the flora has flourished since it was placed.  New <br/>
clues should lead you straight to the letterbox now.  <br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">These boxes bring back great memories for me since they were some of <br/>
my first boxes found way back in 2002.  I had only heard about <br/>
letterboxing a few months before I got to take a business trip to <br/>
Washington, and since there were hardly any boxes in TX at that time, <br/>
I decided to try the ones in Washington.  I had so much fun I'm sure <br/>
this helped hook me on letterboxing, and I enjoyed Ft. Canby so much <br/>
I came back the next year and placed my Lewis &amp; Clark In WA box.  <br/>
Glad to hear your boxes are still there!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks all for the kind comments.  It was great getting reacquainted <br/>
with my old lighthouse letterboxes again. It had been years since I <br/>
was on the Long Beach Peninsula.  Next time  I'll be smart and take a <br/>
cooler to load up on shellfish at Oysterville!   I could have slurped <br/>
down a ton of those Willapa Bays.  At least an oyster shooter at <br/>
Castaways in Long Beach Saturday night got me through the craving.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many more letterboxes in that area than there used to <br/>
be.  It had been our intention to get a few of the letterboxes there, <br/>
a biblical one from MonkeyBrain (I think was who placed one), Don &amp; <br/>
Gwen, and Silver Eagle.  We did manage to get Silver Eagle's Lewis &amp; <br/>
Clark in WA box, but because of what my mother calls a "frog-<br/>
strangling rain" we were soaked to the bone and our clues were <br/>
disintegrating into mushed pulp so we pretty much gave up after that.  <br/>
It was getting later in the day anyway, so McKenzie Head and the other <br/>
one we had clues for will have to wait for another time. <br/>
<br/>
It has been a while since I posted.  I'm still alive believe it or not <br/>
and every so often I will threaten to rear my ugly head!  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing and Happy Holidays to you all!<br/>
