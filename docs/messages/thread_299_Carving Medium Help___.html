<br/>
Can anyone give me some pointers on where to find larger white rubber?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

PS:  Really like the survey feature, although it removes some of the discussion.  Thanks, Mitch.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just ordered (and received) some PZ cut<br/>
from Stampeaz:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.investorsnet.com/stampeaz/<br/>
<br/>
It has a look and feel of the white erasers.<br/>
It comes in large 4.75 x 10 x .25" sheets,<br/>
and is $5 per sheet. I carved my second (ever)<br/>
stamp on this stuff yesterday, and I love<br/>
how it carves... almost exactly like the white<br/>
erasers.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I did notice about it, however, is<br/>
that the ink I was using to test my stamp<br/>
was waterbased marker (so I could rinse it<br/>
off quickly and go back to carving). Where the<br/>
Mars eraser's hold the ink in a smooth layer,<br/>
the PZ cut has a slight tendency to bead up<br/>
the ink so the surface is dotted instead of<br/>
smooth. I haven't yet tested my stamp with<br/>
other inks - I will get some this afternoon<br/>
and report back. Perhaps a mild abrasive on<br/>
the surface of the PZ cut before cutting will<br/>
help the ink to lay evenly. I'll try that on my<br/>
next stamp too.<br/>
<br/>
I'm so excited about my first stamp! It turned<br/>
out pretty cool, and I was able to fit all the<br/>
elements into it I wanted. I've never seen a<br/>
"personal signature" stamp before, so I had no <br/>
preconceptions or ideas to work with.<br/>
If it's not a secret, what do other people's<br/>
signature stamps look like?<br/>
