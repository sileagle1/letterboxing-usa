  Don't let it get you down. There are always folks out there just waiting to pounce. I call them SALP's, as in Self Appointed Letterboxing Police. The hell with them. Don't let them rob you of the joy that this hobby brings you. If you know you did the right thing then don't worry about what others think and you do not have to explain yourself to anyone. Bummer, I would have loved to have seen the pics. I've never seen a loon, but have been called crazy as a loon so maybe I might feel an affinity.<br/>
<br/>
  Don't let it get you down, do things your way and have a blast,<br/>

Nobody "JUMPED" all over you. Get over it.<br/>
<br/>
Memlili pointed out that there has been a drastic decline in the maine<br/>
loon population due to the obvious intervention of humans. That was<br/>
not in any way shape or form pointing the finger at you. <br/>

In fact, does this make the Somes-Meynell Wildlife Sanctuary guilty of<br/>
policing YOUR letterboxing and photography habits? Well, golly gee, I<br/>
think it's just fine for folks to be oblivious about it in all their<br/>
glory. <br/>

life is just way too much stressful as it is without adding negativity to a<br/>
much loved hobby. <br/>
<br/>
on this case, however, i am speaking up. it is easy to read a post and take<br/>
what we want out of it, either blow it up in a harmful manner or a<br/>
constructive manner. why is it that it is assumed that one broke some kind<br/>
of rule when the end result was a fantastic picture? <br/>
<br/>
for the record skier is one hell of a photographer. you know those pictures<br/>
that you see on the new hampshire state parks brochures? chances are you are<br/>
looking at one of the scenes or wildlife captured by skier.  <br/>
<br/>
i for one think that the loon pictures are fantastic. <br/>

don't usually keep up with the talk lists, but found the 20 Q box and <br/>
other items quite interesting lately.  But what kind of behavior is <br/>
this, self-appointed rightous folks knocking down other folks, for no <br/>
good reason?  This is stupid.  <br/>
<br/>
After spending a WONDERFUL event weekend (Greek Myth-Story Gather, <br/>
Wendell, MA) meeting many local (and some from afar) boxers, my <br/>
spirits are very high about this great hobby and the terrific folks <br/>
who are involved with it.  On the whole, letterboxers (every single <br/>
one I've met) have been honest, creative, enthusiastic, outdoorsy, <br/>
environmentally aware, respectful, caring people.  <br/>
<br/>
To everyone "fanning the flames", please know, you are NOT TYPICAL of <br/>
the typical letterboxer.  Please show some more respect.  <br/>

I dont know who jumped all over you but all I can say is stupid, <br/>
stupid, stupid...there is nothing wrong with taking pictures of nature <br/>
just as long as we don't distub or destroy. Anyone who has EVER taken <br/>
picture knows you don't have to be up close and personal to get a <br/>
beautiful picture. I have been into photography since I was a child <br/>
and I do know what I am talking about. Whomever this person is that is <br/>
jumping on you send them my way I have thick skin and would be more <br/>
than happy to expalin the basics of ethics, for example treat others <br/>
as you would like to be treated. We are all letterboxers here and need <br/>
to stick to the subject at hand (Letterboxing) and not cast judgements <br/>
on others. I for one would LOVE to see your picture. I take many many <br/>
pictures while out letterboxing and enjoy viewing fellow letterboxers <br/>
picture also.<br/>

picture knows you don't have to be up close and personal to get a <br/>
beautiful picture. I have been into photography since I was a child <br/>
and I do know what I am talking about. Whomever this person is that is <br/>
jumping on you send them my way I have thick skin and would be more <br/>
than happy to expalin the basics of ethics, for example treat others <br/>
as you would like to be treated. We are all letterboxers here and need <br/>
to stick to the subject at hand (Letterboxing) and not cast judgements <br/>
on others. I for one would LOVE to see your picture. I take many many <br/>
pictures while out letterboxing and enjoy viewing fellow letterboxers <br/>
picture also.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay folks, these posts are definitely crossing the line into getting<br/>
personal.  I am not just referring to one of the posts, I'm referring to the<br/>
responses to it too.  Please refrain from making personal commentary about<br/>
other letterboxers or their abilities.  The list is supposed to remain<br/>
friendly, and we really don't want to have to start pulling out our<br/>
moderator stops, but I can see this thread disintegrating quickly if this<br/>
line of thought continues.  Please, no personal attacks!  Let it drop and it<br/>
will bring a lot less attention to itself than it deserves.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
