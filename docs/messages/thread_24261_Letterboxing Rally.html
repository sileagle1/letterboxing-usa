  That sounds like a really cool idea!!!!<br/>
  I've been involved in some postal letterboxing fundraisers, but never a planted fundraiser.<br/>
  If I didn't live so far away, I would definitely attend your event.<br/>
  Good luck!!!!<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

For one, what is the fun in paying for clues to boxes for one weekend<br/>
only? Other than a few local folks, (of which you won't get from this<br/>
list) you're not going to really turn people onto letterboxing using<br/>
this approach. If you think that advertising for paid clues will bring<br/>
in tourist traffic, then it will - but not quality long-lasting boxes<br/>
from the likes of those that will remain un-named but known. . . <br/>
<br/>
We might as well start listing our clues on LBNA for $1 a pop! Whaddya<br/>
say Choi?  I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish by selling<br/>
your clues. If you're trying to generate a fund-raiser for your store,<br/>
then perhaps you might try a different approach.<br/>
<br/>
And by "many boxes hidden on the island" how do you mean? Just how<br/>
many of them have you found? Do you realize that the point of<br/>
letterboxing when it was started was more about the discovery of a<br/>
hidden locale or unknown treasure? The hours spent pouring over the<br/>
cryptic clues that only a true connoisseur of the magic arts could<br/>
achieve? I have yet to see anything worthy of that merit in Maine.<br/>
Some have come close, but few have achieved.<br/>
<br/>
Sad that this is the fate of letterboxing as we know it.<br/>
Let's strive for something better.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In defense of the original poster, even tho the idea of a "rally" is<br/>
distasteful to me, they didn't say what the fundraising mission was to be.<br/>
It certainly doesn't have to be for commercial gain.  It really could be for<br/>
a "good cause."  We weren't told what it was for.<br/>
<br/>
And if they're only using the letterboxes they themselves have planted for<br/>
this fundraiser, and the people participating know this is the cause and are<br/>
in support of it in signing up for the "rally", then I personally would<br/>
relate it to letterboxing more like I would relate postal letterboxing to<br/>
letterboxing -- as a little sideline, a little diversion.  I'd prefer to see<br/>
them place boxes far *away* from the locations of boxes that are not in the<br/>
"rally" however.<br/>
<br/>
But if the boxes of other placers in the area are used in the "advertising"<br/>
at all or are encouraged to be found by the "rally entrants" -- *that's*<br/>
what I find distasteful, not to mention potentially dangerous to those<br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
However, yes, I certainly agree, there are folks who use/exploit<br/>
letterboxing for commercial gain, and that's repulsive to me.  They couldn't<br/>
do it, tho, if folks didn't buy into it -- in one way or another.   That's<br/>
come to be part of The American Way.  :-)<br/>

If I had a box in this area and found out that it was listed in you're<br/>
fundraiser I'd be furious to say the least. The most offensive things<br/>
to come across this site are the constant crass attempts at exploiting<br/>
this hobby for commercial gain. Hear, hear, Phyto. I couldn't agree<br/>
more nor say it more diplomatically.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I read the OP a little differently also.  I read it as she would be planting<br/>
15 boxes around the island for one weekend only and whoever found all of<br/>
that 15 boxes would be eligible for a drawing.  She didn't say anything<br/>
about other boxes being "listed" in the program or used as part of the game,<br/>
only said that if someone really liked letterboxing, there were other boxes<br/>
on the island that would give them the opportunity to continue on, and I<br/>
presumed she meant by this "continue on after the event."<br/>
<br/>
This isn't to say that I think it's a 100% great idea, but it seems like<br/>
what most folks are bothered by is the thought that she would be using other<br/>
peoples' boxes as part of the event - maybe I read her post wrong, but I<br/>
don't think that's the case.<br/>
<br/>
The lure of a prize bugs me a bit and so does the charging of money (even<br/>
for a good cause), and I'd sure like to see how it was being implemented.  I<br/>
would hope the presence of the other boxes wouldn't be heavily touted as a<br/>
hook for the activity, but I think it could possibly be conducted in a<br/>
letterbox-responsible manner.<br/>
<br/>
My .02 (or as we've been discussing recently on the Texas list - probably<br/>
more like .01 based on the current oversupply of opinion in the marketplace<br/>
and the inherent value of a given opinion).<br/>

are you raising the money for?  Who is your audience (customers, hunters,<br/>
whatever you want to call them)?  Are you doing more than handing out a clue<br/>
book? Is there a meal/gathering involved as well?<br/>
<br/>
I do agree with others that you should not list boxes that you have not<br/>
planted for this event.  Further, use caution when planting that you are not<br/>
too close to the boxes already in place.<br/>
<br/>
It's not like letterboxing is a secret.  There's been a lot of press lately,<br/>
so anyone that's really interested in the sport/obsession can look us up and<br/>
find us. However, when they do this, they are exposed to education as well.<br/>
Will you be providing training to people?  Explaining the importance of<br/>
preserving the environment?  BITO (Box in Trash out)?  Showing the proper<br/>
care to take with the box in rebagging and rehiding it?  Defining<br/>
noxers/muggles and giving suggestions about how to be steathly without<br/>
looking like a criminal?  Hmmm maybe on that one you could share with all of<br/>
us!  One can always use new ideas in that area! *wink*<br/>
<br/>
My point is only that there are a lot of things to consider when hosting an<br/>
event with Boxers.... when you bring in people who are brand new - the<br/>
considerations jump exponentially.<br/>

Your comments are way off base. The original writer asked "What do <br/>
you think?" and one should fully expect to receive negative as well <br/>
as positive input. There should be no need of your sarcastic line <br/>
about being supportive and then in other posts calling the Lady P <br/>
some @#@**%. As far as I'm aware the Lady P has never been a @#@**%, <br/>
she usually is more of a *^$#@@ and her input was asked for.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Has anyone done or gone to an event like this before, and can you <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I live in Bar Harbor, ME which is on Mount Desert Island. My idea <br/>
is to <br/>
&gt; &gt; hide 15 boxes around the island for one weekend only. Charge a <br/>
fee <br/>
&gt; &gt; ($10) for the clues. The people who find all 15 boxes by the end <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sunday go into a drawing for a prize.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; There are many boxes hidden on the Island, so an real enthusist <br/>
would <br/>
&gt; &gt; have many more to find if 15 didn't quench his thirst for <br/>
searching.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; What do you folks think of this plan. Any suggestions?<br/>

Unfortunately this pasttime is always going to be split into<br/>
groups........groups of those who liked it best 10 years ago, those who<br/>
liked it best 5 years ago, those who like it best right now.  What was the<br/>
name of that guy out in California that just wanted to get along???  Ronny,<br/>
Randy, Ricky, Rodney, something like that?<br/>
<br/>
As to the needing an excuse to get the family outdoors, I've never been able<br/>
to understand that.<br/>
<br/>
(Not to blame the poster previous to Brian, however, because they only<br/>
stated they wanted letterboxing to be a fun family activity, they didn't<br/>
state that was the only way they had of getting their family outdoors.  But<br/>
there have been plenty of posters who *have* mentioned that that was the<br/>
only way they'd succeeded in getting outdoors.)<br/>
<br/>
I've found The Way.  The Way Outdoors, that is.  And the technique is<br/>
straight out of The National Enquirer (or maybe it was The Star), so<br/>
everybody's gotta believe it, there's no denyin' it:<br/>
<br/>
"To get outdoors, ya puts one foot in front of the other foot in front of<br/>
the other foot in front of the other foot in front of the other foot until<br/>
reaching the front door and then -- opening the door of course -- continue<br/>
putting one foot in front of the other foot in front of the other foot in<br/>
front of the other foot........."<br/>
<br/>
Now if one doesn't live next-door to a forest preserve or other nifty<br/>
outdoor spot, a set of four tires and a steering wheel might also have to be<br/>
included in there at some point.  A picnic basket and a bottle of wine might<br/>
also find itself included too -- oops! there might go the "Family" in Family<br/>
Fun so take out the wine.  Or maybe just a little *more* Family to come<br/>
along, eh?  So maybe leave in the wine and find a babysitter.  Isn't there a<br/>
box in the East near a waterfall that's in a very pretty spot for couples?<br/>
Oh well.  I've just never understood why a letterbox is needed.  But then my<br/>
job keeps me outdoors pretty much all the time, so whaddoIknow?  Me, a tent,<br/>
a Dog-Named-Elmer, and a horse with a kick-butt rear end is all I need.<br/>
But maybe there really *are* people who only want videogames in their life.<br/>
<br/>
I keep picturing Mole from The Wind in the Willow.  But heck, even Mole knew<br/>
how to get outdoors, and did so, lovely as it was for him to get back home.<br/>
<br/>
If there's anyone from the Chicago area reading this during daylight hours<br/>
today, you shouldn't be!  You should be out boxing.  I'm stuck home so that<br/>
Good-ol'-Boy-Elmer can supervise an electrician and a plumber down in the<br/>
basement of The Money Pit.  He loves having something to supervise down<br/>
there other than mice for once.<br/>

But I'd ask that it not be called "Letterboxing" to begin with, and other people's boxes should not even be mentioned, even vaguely. Call it a scavenger hunt, a treasure hunt, whatever, but maybe you shouldn't name other secretive hunting games.  You could maybe publish on the clues a statement that other searching games exist but most require playing by each hobby's set of written and unwritten rules. Just allude to more games being out there. People who participate in this proposed type of scavenger event who like it could  _decide for themselves if they want to look further into treasure hunting games_.  Then the job of gathering info and learning what's generally considered acceptable among treasure seekers falls upon them. Anyone who is already an enthusiast of letterboxing would probably avoid the event, or at least avoid searching for boxes placed by other placers during this event because they might accidentally divulge the locations of other people's boxes. That's not cool.<br/>

..and I feel sorry to people who are new to the list and read the angry diatribe you post on a regular basis, because you are going to scare all the new people away.<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice day.<br/>

Hi, Leslie,<br/>
<br/>
I think you just "discovered" the objective. Sort of. <br/>
<br/>
Take a deep breath and relax. I used to get my panties in a bunch with the touting, ranting, blathering...  mostly by people who seem infatuated with themselves.  You can't really regulate people, you certainly can't get rid of pests by feeding them, and some people and their posts are just a joke. (Even if they can't see it.)  So, when people post with self-importance and assumed authority, try not to over-react.  Each of the comments has some good points, I think, even when you have to wade through the spew to find it.  Don't attibute to malice to what might be self-righteousness, ego, or fear.  I think (and I could be wrong) what raises hackles here (or amongst 'boxers in general) the most is fear: Fear of losing boxes, fear of becoming shut out of park systems or other public lands, fear of commercialism... basically fear of anyone changing letterboxing from either what they believe it was when they joined in or what they believe they have helped it to remain or become. <br/>
<br/>
You might want to channel your anger or indignation into maybe explaining to the original poster, maybe even off list so people don't add their own 2, as to why the silent majority remains silent on these lists (as if that's not apparent!) and why we all feel very protective of letterboxing as each of us perceives it. We do, generally, try to take care of each other's boxes, but don't generally toot our own horns or get obnoxious.  Those that do (act weird or inappropriate, bossy, condescending, egomaniacal)...  well, they may get a small following but most of us just shake our heads and delete.<br/>
<br/>
Yours in boxing,<br/>

to come up with a creative fundraiser on your own so you steal the <br/>
idea from a group of hobbyists who care deeply about it.<br/>
<br/>
If there is a fundraiser involving letterboxing perhaps the <br/>
only 'good cause" it should support is letterboxing!  The LBNA <br/>
website costs $$$ to run each year which comes out of the pockets of <br/>
volunteers because it is the belief of those who have been in this <br/>
thing from the begining that letterboxing should remain FREE for <br/>
anyone who wants to try it out.<br/>
<br/>
So, please find another way to raise funds for your organization or, <br/>
as Team Safari suggested, at least eliminate any reference to any <br/>
other organization in your offerings. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and for the poster who said that letterboxing wasn't a secret---<br/>
it used to be until a few decided they wanted 15 minutes in the <br/>
limelight to be seen as those designated to speak about this hobby as <br/>
though it were their idea.  <br/>
<br/>
It *is* a secret and a good one.  Just like you wouldn't broadcast <br/>
your favorite fishing hole where you catch all the big ones in, you <br/>
don't broadcast letterboxing--you share it with like minded people.<br/>
<br/>
'Nuff said.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; As a fundraiser for my organization, I am planning a Letterboxing <br/>
Rally<br/>
&gt; for this June.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone done or gone to an event like this before, and can you <br/>
give<br/>
&gt; me some ideas?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I live in Bar Harbor, ME which is on Mount Desert Island. My idea <br/>
is to<br/>
&gt; hide 15 boxes around the island for one weekend only. Charge a fee<br/>
&gt; ($10) for the clues.  The people who find all 15 boxes by the end of<br/>
&gt; Sunday go into a drawing for a prize.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are many boxes hidden on the Island, so an real enthusist <br/>
would<br/>
&gt; have many more to find if 15 didn't quench his thirst for searching.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do you folks think of this plan.  Any suggestions?<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the help!<br/>

<br/>
  Guide her with ideas about what we think about buying clues.  Most of us dont like it, and there are other ways to raise money, and not comprimise other boxes....not sure if selling clues is proper...but again thats up to anybody.  I still have yet to see where I can buy the official "Guide and Rules of Letterboxing" book....Even if I don't agree with it.<br/>
<br/>
  As for using  letterboxing as a way to get the family outside..who am I to say what it is that you like about a hobby, or why you do it?  I'm sure for some its family, others a stupid PFX count....still others have their own independent reason....Last I checked its America, thus we can actually have this debate.<br/>
<br/>
  Remember, it's just stamps, and we are adults...that is actually pretty funny<br/>

with many boxes planted just for the day.As at any gather there is jar for contributions to <br/>
defray costs. His rallies are excellent and finely planned with rules for many contingencies. <br/>
At last years gather there was also a special stamp available for a small contribution to <br/>
help another boxer who had fallen on hard times.<br/>
On fair Dartmoor there are clue books sold as fund raisers. I point this out but I am not an <br/>
advocate of selling clues.<br/>
I think we can support causes with out selling clues.<br/>

they need support for a good cause....<br/>

WOW, and here I was totally lost.  I didn't know that the ONLY reason to <br/>
letterbox was to pour over a clue for hours at a time then hike out to <br/>
who knows where in the hope to find a box.  What a relief we have a <br/>
elite, enlightened person such as yourself to inform us of how things <br/>
should be done!<br/>
<br/>
I just would like to know, did you actually READ the post, or as soon as <br/>
you saw that money was involved you immediately went into <br/>
anti-commercialism, anti-capitalism mode?  Maybe you didn't notice that <br/>
they said they would plant their OWN boxes and sell clues for them for <br/>
ONE weekend for whatever organization they work for.<br/>
<br/>
And you folks wonder why I call you a bunch of arrogant elitists.<br/>

Stampeaz, I have no problem with.  It's not a letterboxing site per se.  I<br/>
hand-carve stamps for my own artwork that will never see the inside of a<br/>
letterbox or the pages of any placer's logbook, and I know other artists<br/>
that do also.  And the other supplies they sell are not just for<br/>
letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, atlasquest does squick me.<br/>
<br/>
But that's my own personal opinion and how *I* see letterboxing.  YMMV.<br/>
Like with the rally idea.  That's up to the rally event planner and the<br/>
people paying to attend as to how they envision letterboxing.  AS LONG AS<br/>
the boxes already placed in the area by *other* placers come to absolutely<br/>
no harm, I wouldn't consider the rally to be any of my business if the<br/>
poster hadn't actually asked for opinions.<br/>

secrecy and candor and commisserating!<br/>

I think the idea of boxing for $$ is a bad one in general. I think the idea of shouting about <br/>
boxing to the world is a bad one, BUT we have to realize it is a public hobby and all we can <br/>

they learn from me...a big LB snob!, than from some 2 bit article in the paper...)<br/>
<br/>
I think because Joy just heard about LBing, she doesn't understand the big and sensitive <br/>
issues in LBing which we all know are VERY important. Personally, I am choosing to take <br/>
mine off the radar because I feel like it promotes the spirit of boxing that I enjoy the best. <br/>
Honestly, when boxing because a contest and a $$ raiser, I don't want to be involved <br/>
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, trying sort of hash out my feelings about this as I write. I think that we may really <br/>
need to think about the future of LBing...I know I have for a while now. Why do I feel so <br/>
passionately that she ask p[ermission to list local boxes when it is a "public" sport and my <br/>
boxes are out there for the public? I would hate it if this crazy obsession ended up <br/>
splitting into a public free for all contest and an underground secret society. Honestly, I <br/>
think it is starting already and I am all for the covert operations!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As a relative newbie (3 yrs casually, this year having the time to devote) I, too have been concerned about this.  It seems that it will become a good time grab fest.  Based on what I have found in recent outings, it seems LBing has become a reckless sport rather than the individual pursuit of satisfaction and reconnection with one's surroundings that enticed me in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what to do about it, unless we find a way to go back to covertly meeting and sharing clues locally fanning out to trusted sources (as originally done) rather than internet posting of clues.  It may serve to slow down not only the demise of the hobby's original intent, but perhaps the plant with abandon mentality that is becoming so prolific.  I don't ever want to find myself in competition with others over how many boxes I've found, planted, exchanged, whatever - that seems to fuel the seemingly inevitable decline by reducing it to a sport of numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on how to reverse or slow this beyond giving up, dropping out, and turning it over to those who would redefine it (and probably destroy delicate ecosystems in the process)? <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; For one, what is the fun in paying for clues to boxes for one weekend<br/>
&gt; only? Other than a few local folks, (of which you won't get from this<br/>
&gt; list) you're not going to really turn people onto letterboxing using<br/>
&gt; this approach. If you think that advertising for paid clues will bring<br/>
&gt; in tourist traffic, then it will - but not quality long-lasting boxes<br/>
&gt; from the likes of those that will remain un-named but known. . . <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We might as well start listing our clues on LBNA for $1 a pop! Whaddya<br/>
&gt; say Choi? I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish by selling<br/>
&gt; your clues. If you're trying to generate a fund-raiser for your store,<br/>
&gt; then perhaps you might try a different approach.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And by "many boxes hidden on the island" how do you mean? Just how<br/>
&gt; many of them have you found? Do you realize that the point of<br/>
&gt; letterboxing when it was started was more about the discovery of a<br/>
&gt; hidden locale or unknown treasure? The hours spent pouring over the<br/>
&gt; cryptic clues that only a true connoisseur of the magic arts could<br/>
&gt; achieve? I have yet to see anything worthy of that merit in Maine.<br/>
&gt; Some have come close, but few have achieved.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sad that this is the fate of letterboxing as we know it.<br/>
&gt; Let's strive for something better.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; &gt; As a fundraiser for my organization, I am planning a Letterboxing Rally <br/>
&gt; &gt; for this June.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Has anyone done or gone to an event like this before, and can you give <br/>
&gt; &gt; me some ideas?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I live in Bar Harbor, ME which is on Mount Desert Island. My idea is to <br/>
&gt; &gt; hide 15 boxes around the island for one weekend only. Charge a fee <br/>
&gt; &gt; ($10) for the clues. The people who find all 15 boxes by the end of <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sunday go into a drawing for a prize.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; There are many boxes hidden on the Island, so an real enthusist would <br/>
&gt; &gt; have many more to find if 15 didn't quench his thirst for searching.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; What do you folks think of this plan. Any suggestions?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for the help!<br/>
