&gt; I would appreciate it if posters could intentionally change the <br/>

the <br/>
&gt; post.  That way I can think I'll be reading about some pleasurable <br/>
&gt; Disney worthy jaunt your family made into the jungle and instead I <br/>
&gt; will find myself gleefully reading yet another off-topic rant full <br/>
&gt; of misplaced anger and he-said, she-saids.<br/>

&gt; That would really make my day, especially since I can't find my <br/>
&gt; rubber chicken nor my Martian popping thing.<br/>
