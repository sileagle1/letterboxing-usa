<br/>
This box is in Claremont, California in Eastern Los Angeles County.  <br/>
I placed it July 28, 2002.<br/>
<br/>
The Thompson Creek Trail runs adjacent to the Thompson Creek flood <br/>
control channel along the base of the foothills.  For this <br/>
letterbox,  you can best access the trail from  Indian Hill Blvd. or <br/>
from Towne Avenue.  Both these streets intersect Foothill Blvd the <br/>
old Route 66), Baseline Road and finally the trail.   From Towne Ave, <br/>
you will want to walk east,  with the mountains on your left. From <br/>
Indian Hill Blvd,  you will want to walk west with the mountains on <br/>
your right.  The box is on the trail between these two access <br/>
points.  Look for a marking like this:<br/>
<br/>
                  241 + 00<br/>
                    SBM<br/>
                   6" vent<br/>
                  100 &gt;<br/>
                 241 + ~ 698<br/>
                      7<br/>
<br/>
Standing on the trail, with your back to this marking, go forward 30 <br/>
paces to the back of the clearing.  Turn left and go 39 paces to a <br/>
tree on your right.  The base of this tree is surrounded by <br/>
shrubbery.  The box is hidden in the rocks at the base of the tree.<br/>
Be careful not to disturb the irrigation system.   <br/>
