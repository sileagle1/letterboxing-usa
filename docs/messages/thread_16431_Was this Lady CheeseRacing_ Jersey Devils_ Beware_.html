Thu Oct 16, 9:52 AM ET   <br/>
<br/>
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A supermarket rat that had dodged a number of <br/>
poison traps got its comeuppance when an 80-year-old shopper knocked <br/>
it unconscious after it tried to steal her cheese, a Belgian daily <br/>
said Thursday. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The rat had been hiding in the supermarket for a month, but staff <br/>
attempts to trap the rodent had repeatedly failed. <br/>
<br/>
The woman told the daily Gazet Van Antwerpen how she suddenly felt a <br/>
sharp pain in her hand after picking up a pack of cheese at the <br/>
supermarket just outside Brussels. <br/>
<br/>
"A rat the size of my hand was hanging on my finger," she told the <br/>
newspaper. <br/>
<br/>
"I grabbed the rat with my other hand and smacked it on the floor. <br/>
The animal was on the floor, completely knocked unconscious." <br/>
<br/>

Okay, you Jersey folks need to consider the horrible ramifications of <br/>
cheeseracing. JugglerMouse and I sent you the CheeseRacing Ballot Box <br/>
on Tuesday. You may use both stamps (Go CheeseRacing! &amp; St. Brie) in <br/>
your log books; however, you need to stamp either the Go CheeseRacing <br/>
side (if you are a degenerate who cares nothing about rodents and <br/>
little Belgium ladies) or side with the saints and stamp in on the <br/>
St. Brie side.<br/>
<br/>
St. Brie is depicted in her martyrdom, toasting on a gridiron. Brie <br/>
was a companion to St. Lawrence and chose to follow him into the fire <br/>
rather than obey her father and take up the pagan and demonic <br/>
practice of "la frommage fumer." This lovely and horrific image will <br/>
be sure to adorn any small tryptich or icon collection in your home <br/>
or business. Make sure that when the final accounting comes due in <br/>
the cheeseshop of life, your name (or personal stamp) is registered <br/>
with the angels.<br/>
<br/>
Yours for an unbiased voting,<br/>
Sir Balthazar, Order St. Brie<br/>
