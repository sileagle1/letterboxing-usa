Thank you for posting these clues to the<br/>
"Puako Petroglyph" letterbox. (can I send along a photo as well?)<br/>
___________________________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
On the Big Island of Hawaii you will find this magical place of sacredness.<br/>
<br/>
Locate the  Holoholokai Beach Park, open each day from 6:30am - 6:30pm. The<br/>
road to this park connects to the road at the Orchid at Mauna Lani. This<br/>
coast is steeped with history and it is here that you will find the Puako<br/>
Petroglyph trail. It is .7 miles of mystical trails within the archway  of<br/>
Kiawi trees. You must pay attention at all times as the trail hosts both<br/>
sand and lava. At the end of the trail is one of the largest collections of<br/>
Hawaiian Petroglyshs ever exposed. Find the bench at the field and walk 21<br/>
steps straight back into the forest. This will lead you up a little hill to<br/>
an out-cropping of boulders. Buried in a small collection of rocks at the<br/>
inside base of the boulders is the letterbox. Enjoy the spirit of place and<br/>
plan for a picnic at the glorious beach park!<br/>
<br/>
Planted on a beautiful day  in August of 2001, by T and Sky.<br/>

Petroglyphs<br/>
Ancient Hawaiian Rock Art<br/>
<br/>
Want to get a true picture of the history of Hawai'i? You can learn a lot<br/>
from Hawaiian petroglyphs - ancient rock carvings that tell stories about<br/>
early life on the islands.<br/>
<br/>
The Hawaiian petroglyphs is a great mystery of the Pacific. No one knows who<br/>
made them or why the artists etched the linear and triangular figures into<br/>
the pahoehoe lava. These<br/>
graphic carvings, more than 3,000 of them, were probably made as part of<br/>
ritual or prayer and speak of spiritual phenomena - mana<br/>
<br/>
The petroglyphs of Hawai'i are much more than captivating designs. To the<br/>
ancient Polynesians they had meaning and significance, including a spiritual<br/>
component. Hawaiian petroglyphs deserve to be protected and preserved as<br/>
nonrenewable assets and as gift left behind by the ancient Hawaiians who<br/>
carved their prayers and offerings into the hard lava of these Pacific<br/>
islands.<br/>
<br/>
Upon approaching a petroglyphs field, a wonderful cast of characters leap to<br/>
life. There are dancers, paddlers, fishermen, and family groups. Turtle,<br/>
dog, ship and horse symbols are also depicted, as well as fish hooks,<br/>
spears, poi pounders and canoes. There are 135 different petroglyphs sites<br/>
on six inhabited islands, but most of them are found on the Big Island of<br/>
Hawai'i. <br/>

From: F. Toosi<br/>
City: Pittsburgh, PA, USA<br/>
<br/>
This is my first try, so the directions are pretty<br/>
straightforward...a beta test for more urban<br/>
letterboxes to come!<br/>
<br/>
In Oakland going west on Forbes Avenue, pass the<br/>
Carnegie Museum and Library. After the museum, turn<br/>
right on S. Bellefield Avenue.<br/>
<br/>
Turn left on Fifth Avenue, crossing over to the north<br/>
side of the street.<br/>
<br/>
Walk past Tennyson Avenue, Lytton Avenue, and Bigelow<br/>
Boulevard.<br/>
<br/>
Just before the sign that says "General Matthew B.<br/>
Ridgeway", take a seat on the concrete bench closest<br/>
to the stairs.  If you pass the flag pole you have<br/>
gone too far.  <br/>
<br/>
You should be seated directly in front of the first<br/>
non-handicapped parking meter, # OW 270 (the 2 is<br/>
missing).<br/>
<br/>
The box is hidden in the corner of the hedge.  It is<br/>
the corner closest to the edge of the bench and the<br/>
wall surrounding the lawn.  <br/>

You wouldn't get the clue until you finished your mug(s) of ale...  <br/>
(at least, that's how it happened with 'hash' runs back then)  For <br/>
those not in the know about 'hash' running groups, they <br/>
are 'drinking groups with a slight running problem'...  ;)<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail...<br/>
