                    <html><body><p>Spike,
</p><p>I just wanted to thank you for wapping this box in a baggy.  We checked on Mr. Jefferson's Microbox and did the same thing, but didn't think this one would stay hidden as well in a baggy.  Funny, I ran those little boxes under the sink in the Container Store to check for water-tightness, but I guess seeping water can still nab them after a while!
</p><p>By the way, if we cross paths letterboxing, I too am "great with child"...when's your big day?  :)  I have 10 weeks to go, and I'm afraid by the time the snow finally melts I'm not going to be able to walk on many hunts...:(   Oh well, we'll just get a baby carrier and take him out with us when he comes!
</p><p>Thanks again,
</p><p>Erika, AKA Mama Frog

(following the<br/>footprints in the snow makes boxing somewhat less<br/>challenging, i must say...)<br/>independence looked like it had previously been wet,<br/>but the book was ok, so we shoved it in a zip-loc and<br/>shoved it back into the grass. <br/>was bitterly cold with the wind, and the snow wasnt<br/>nearly as bad as the rivers of melting run-off, but it<br/>was a good day overall.  what is the recall date on<br/>the castle box- assuming it is still there?<br/>good luck to all<br/>spike-<br/><br/>ps- to make it easier to identify me, should we pass<br/>while boxing, for an exchange or such,i am female and<br/>currently quite pregnant!<br/><br/>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
