What a wonderful day we had! There were 44 people--including 2 babies and 3 <br/>
dogs! We had 15 boxes to find (in one park!) tons of food to eat and great new <br/>
friends to make. We had Amanda from Seattle, A-Bear from Idaho and Silent Doug <br/>
from PA to make it a 4-state triumph and Sir Balthazar and Jugglermouse from <br/>
way down in San Luis Obispo. Lizzardbutt, Hungry Eye and their family, <br/>
PrincessLea, Snail Lady, Turtle Leader and their crew and a bunch of enthusiastic <br/>
newbies too!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who attended and made the day exceed our expectations--and <br/>
believe me, our expectations are always high!!<br/>
<br/>
There are photos and I'll get to posting them soon!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">WE had a blast! Lizardbutt, who prefers to bike it, survived the <br/>
gruelling hike looking for "The Boxer Family" and had fun hunting <br/>
down Doublesaj and Old Blue's clever, cute stamps. We all had fun <br/>
slipping and sliding down the hill with A-Bear. I had a wonderful <br/>
time chatting with A-Bear while we hiked. Bookworm enjoyed the <br/>
wonderful views from the top of the hill and locating the boxes. <br/>
Jetlag said that he was satisfied with his cardio workout.<br/>
I thank A-Bear for her cute No Speed Zone stamps, Jenni and Paul for <br/>
their Take a Hike box, and Silent Doug for his plant that is no <br/>
longer there. Princess Lea's Schoolhouse Rock and Miss Vickie's Itchy <br/>
and Scrathy will have to wait another day to be found. Kennedy Grove <br/>
is such a delightful park that I am looking forward to hiking and <br/>
letterboxing the park again. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
We had a wonderful time chatting and exchanging stamps with so many <br/>
friendly folks. To all the new letterboxers that showed up yesterday <br/>
for the event: welcome to letterboxing. Thank you Amanda, Silent <br/>
Doug, Sir Balthazar and Jugglemouse for visitng with the Nor. Cal <br/>
boxers. Thank you Doublesaj, Old Blue and Calpilot for traveling to <br/>
the Bay Area for the event. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you Miss Vickie, Princess Lea and Doublesaj for organizing this <br/>
great event. <br/>

I expected to read that Wanda of Wanda &amp; Pete fame made an <br/>
appearance. From what I can gather she has made an appearance at most <br/>
of the Meet &amp; Greets east of the Mississippi this past year. I call <br/>
her Hurricane Wanda. She whirls in, leaves her mark and whoosh off <br/>
she goes to the next event.<br/>
    Princess Turtle is happy to see her HH's are safely dispersed on <br/>
the west coast. My obnoxiuos HH, RRR/PAP, is back in Calif. for it's <br/>
second trip. I would like to know of it's adventures. Please post on <br/>
this list if you have him/her/it. Keep it moving, so place it where <br/>
you know it won't sit for very long.<br/>

We were the lucky recipients of said HH compliments of the lovely mailbox of <br/>
Lizardbutt's family. A lot of us at the Nor Cal Gathering yesterday deposited <br/>
HHs into the box then pulled another out to send on its way. I noted the <br/>
infamous Psychomommy had one in there and grabbed it. To find out it has a link to <br/>
Ryan makes it even more coveted for me! <br/>
<br/>
We will be going to Lake Tahoe next weekend (for our 30th wedding <br/>
anniversary) and will drop it off somewhere up there--maybe into one of our I-80 series <br/>
boxes (as we check up on them) which we hear are being well received. This way, <br/>
it might make it up to the PNW for Ryan's eventual return west!<br/>
<br/>
It was fun meeting your sis, Lizardbutt and the rest of the family. <br/>
Hopefully, someday we'll cross paths with you too!<br/>

for organizing the Nor Cal event. We had a great time meeting some of the <br/>
west coast letterbox contingent. Thanks too to everyone else who made us <br/>
feel so welcome in our new home state. It's nice to know that when you lose <br/>
your clues on the trail, you can rely on other letterboxers to point you in the <br/>
right direction.<br/>

We'll get those Peninsula boxes planted soon...<br/>
