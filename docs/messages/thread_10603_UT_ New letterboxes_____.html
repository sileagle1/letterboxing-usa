hunt down a few letterboxes, I've hidden a couple in beautiful places <br/>
such as Bryce Canyon and Arches National Parks.  However, knowing how <br/>
the National Park Service frowns on letterboxing, I'm choosing NOT to <br/>
post them to the LbNA site.  Instead, you'll have to visit my own <br/>
website at http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb if you want the clues <br/>
for them.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, not all of my boxes are located on the main <br/>
letterboxing site (mostly for that specific reason).  So you Wyoming <br/>
folks might be interested in Yellowstone boxes on my website.  A few <br/>
boxes I hid I turned into mystery boxes to foil attempts at <br/>
unauthorized people finding them.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, enjoy the boxes!  But webmasters, don't go adding any of <br/>
these to the website!<br/>
