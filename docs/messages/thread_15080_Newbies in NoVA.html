We've just begun our letterboxing adventures after hearing about it <br/>
from a friend.  Unfortunately our first two haven't been complete <br/>
successes.  We weren't able to find Mother Goose at Green Spring <br/>
Gardens (could the heavy rains have washed it out of it's hiding <br/>
place?) &amp; when we found the Bananaconda at Burke Lake, we couldn't <br/>
find the stamp.  Did we miss something or is this just the way it is <br/>
sometimes?  <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to stamping around some more.<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes boxes are so well hidden you miss them, sometimes they are missing <br/>
and sometimes they are damaged.. Keep with it and you are bound to find lots <br/>
of boxes in great shape with beautiful stamps!<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I videotaped our first attempt at letterboxing over a year ago <br/>
now (new video camera, new letterboxing hobby - what a combo!) and we totally <br/>
missed where the box was at first.. the tape shows us scanning right past it <br/>
several times.  We never video taped a hunt again - I got motion sick trying <br/>
to watch it!<br/>
<br/>
Now I can usually spot the likely hiding spot from 30 feet away.  Of course <br/>
I'm not always right.. :-D<br/>
<br/>
Good luck on your next outing!<br/>
