birthday. We thought of Dr. King and spoke of him many times today <br/>
and found it so ironic that one of the boxes we went to today had a <br/>
bonus box with it and the name of that bonus box was "Peace". We were <br/>
absolutely amazed- it was so perfect but then again, it was a Drew <br/>
Clan Box. Good Things happen around Clan Drew Letterboxes ! We were <br/>
also honored to meet Josef Carlson today. What a good and kind young <br/>
man you are ! We are so pleased that you were first to complete the <br/>
Quest Mystery Series and love what you are going to do with it !<br/>
Blessings to all and a "Right On" to Magic Mike for speaking his <br/>
mind ! Plant those Hitchhikers !<br/>
