Bear left at the state park sign and drive down Rte. 600 (Gunston <br/>
Road) past the "gated communities." Turn right into the lot for the <br/>
NWR's Great Marsh Trail. Park your car and begin a leisurely (flat <br/>
and paved!) 3/4 mile stroll to the observation platform that <br/>
overlooks the marsh. Bring binoculars and watch the red-winged <br/>
blackbirds and blue-winged teal zip back and forth across the <br/>
wetland. What a place!<br/>
<br/>
When you are ready to find the treasure, begin counting wooden <br/>
benches as you return to the lot from the marsh. After you've passed <br/>
the first bench on the right (4th overall) and as soon as you have <br/>
the second bench on the right in sight ahead, look to your right -- <br/>
about 15 yds. off the trail -- for a tree with 5 trunks!! (We think <br/>
it's a yellow poplar.) <br/>
