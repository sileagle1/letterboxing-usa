 <br/>
I would have to agree that the boxes in Flagstaff are definitely worth getting.  I quite enjoyed Azroadie's "Fort Tuthill" box as well as his "Historie Route 66".  And if you get time, you can go east just a bit from Flagstaff to Winona, AZ and get Azroadie's "Don't Forget Winona" box, too.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
That "Red Tank" letterbox looks like a good one to get.<br/>
 <br/>
I did a search on AQ.... at the very top I clicked on "Letterboxes"... then clicked on "Simple Search"... at the bottom left of that page you can do a trip search.  I clicked on the drop down list and selected "I-17" (since that'll be the main freeway you can take up to Flagstaff at least).  I selected Phoenix as the starting point and Flagstaff as the ending point.  It will give you boxes that you can find along I-17.<br/>
 <br/>
I don't know if that helps you any.  Hope you enjoy your boxing trip!! :)<br/>
<br/>
Yours in 'boxing, <br/>
