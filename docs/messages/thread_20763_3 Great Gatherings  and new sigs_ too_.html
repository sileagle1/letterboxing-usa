The East Coast has certainly been swept by a gust of great fall <br/>
gatherings lately - 3 weekends in a row, each hosting its own very <br/>
distinctive and remarkable event! ( and the tripod is still standing <br/>
in NJ, too!;-)<br/>
<br/>
First, of course, we were all blown away by Chuck's gang's mind-<br/>
boggling Monster Mash in northeastern CT, with its whirlwind of <br/>
monsters, activities, hotdogs and many other types of dogs, including <br/>
those "monster dogs" unleashed down on Dog Lane!<br/>
<br/>
Next, the following weekend, we were gently scattered to the four <br/>
winds on those old AT paths, "narrow for chosen company", at Koyote <br/>
and the Dawnlanders' well-crafted, Native American-themed "Four <br/>
Directions" gathering in northwestern CT, where we were most impresed <br/>
to see Rush Gatherer turning fry bread in hot oil with small sticks, <br/>
and to find a fine feathered "friend" from Cactus Licker of Texas!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, just this past weekend, we caught a sweet breeze down to <br/>
Palmyra Bridge for the 2nd annual NJ Gathering, where we were treated <br/>
not only to letterboxingbee's nicely carved turkey sandwiches, but to <br/>
many fine examples of her stamp carving as well, including a lovely <br/>
pair of "Palmyra Palms" that she graciously gifted us with to replace <br/>
our little old store-bought "signature stamps"!<br/>
<br/>
Actually, last weekend letterboxingbee's husband Rob and I were both  <br/>
suffering from having just recently had root canals with infection <br/>
complications, so it was probably good to get our minds off that onto <br/>
other activities. However, my mind must have wandered off just a <br/>
little too far, because I suffered some additional panic worrying <br/>
that I'd somehow managed to lose both my old and new sigs at one fell <br/>
swoop! Fortunately they turned up shortly, lying on the grass at <br/>
Hickory Dickory Dock, so now I'm happy to report that those new sig <br/>
stamps of ours can already be seen at some 40 letterboxes around NJ, <br/>
as well as in 4 hitchers, 20 logbooks, and even a couple of postal <br/>
boxes that showed up for the occasion! We're still hoping that <br/>
carvers from ME, WA and CT will come through for us with new sig <br/>
stamps, too, but meanwhile you can expect to see those "Palmyra <br/>
Palms" carved for us by letterboxingbee Bev wherever we go!( and that <br/>
second "colorful set" will probably end up getting planted near the <br/>
place where Pete and I first met! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Bev, for a fantastic job on everything, and thanks again to <br/>
the many other folks all around the country who have so warmly and <br/>
generously given of their time, talents, energy and resources to make <br/>
these wonderful events happen! Now it seems we have a little "break <br/>
in the wind", so to speak, but you can be sure we'll be looking <br/>
forward to many more welcoming gathering breezes in the months and <br/>
years to come - as long as they don't fall on the same day or <br/>
conflict with other things!<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks for all the great gatherings!!!<br/>
<br/>
