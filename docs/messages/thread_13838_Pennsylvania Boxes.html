                    <div class="plaintext-content">Donna &amp; Darrin  --  There aren't too many on the New Jersey side when <br/>
you head south on 202 from 287; however, just as you cross over the <br/>
50 cent toll bridge on 202 from NJ to PA, take the loop to the right <br/>
just after paying and head south on 29. You will pass through New <br/>
Hope (slow going - lots of traffic) and after a few ( 6 - 8) miles <br/>
you will approach Washington's Crossing and Bowman's Tower.<br/>
<br/>
Before you leave tommorrow, go on the LbNA site and click on PA <br/>
(Bucks County) and then on 2 letterbox sites "Winahawcawchuck" <br/>
and "Bowman's Tower". these are two good hunts. Yup! Washington's <br/>
Crossing is the actual site where George crossed the Delaware to lick <br/>
the Hessions on Christmas Eve. There's a neat museum at the crossing <br/>
site.<br/>
<br/>
See you Saturday sometime between 11 and 12! Let me know if you need <br/>
directions to the picnic. Throw a blanket or a couple of folding <br/>
chairs in the trunk as we are expecting a fairly large turnout.<br/>
