                    <html><body><div>Hi Webmasters,</div> <div> </div> <div>We have the following revisions to make in our clue for "The British Are Coming" Letterbox in Prospect, Maine.</div> <div> </div> <div>Instead of 1 letterbox - it should be changed to 2 (on the web-page)</div> <div> </div> <div>The revisions to the first box are in bold.  It should now read:</div> <p>The British are coming, the British are coming! A British warship has been spotted trying to sneak up the Penobscot river. All militia are hereby ordered to report at once to the fort. Muster at the main entrance. A ship has been spotted north of the fort, make haste to "B" battery and proceed to the bottom (whale oil lamps will be very helpful). At the bottom you will find more steps on the eastern side, double time down until you emerge from the fort. <strong>Walk straight forward 3 paces to the granite walkway/embankment, jump over the edge and search under rocks at the base of the granite walkway/embankment</strong>. (Be very careful and discreet, there are numerous foreign spies who would love to destroy our hidden ammunition). When you find it, fire at will!! Congratulations you sank the enemy vessel! </p> <div>Thanks so very much!!</div> <div>TwoMaineCats</div> <div> </div> <div>E-mail with questions: twomainecats@msn.com<br/><br/></div></body></html>
