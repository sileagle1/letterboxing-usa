                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yep.  For me, it's Lock &amp; Lock all the way now.  I've found them in St.<br/>
Louis, MO at Target and at Shop 'n' Save - seems like every store has a<br/>
different assortment, so you may want to check around.  I'm visiting a<br/>
friend in Wilmington, DE right now for some "hot letterboxing action,"<br/>
and they sell them at Pathmark, which had a really nice little 6 ounce<br/>
size that I had not seen before.  I bought two to bring home...<br/>
<br/>
The problem with the cheapie Gladware type containers is lack of<br/>
durability; the problem with the traditional Tupperware/Rubbermaid type<br/>
is folks don't always get the lid on completely!  Lock &amp; Lock's design<br/>
ensures that even the dimmest 'boxer get the lid shut properly.  I<br/>
hope.  ;-p<br/>

Umm. yeah. We thought the same. Box, tabs, obvious. Right. When we were <br/>
maintaining one of our boxes - a Lock &amp; Lock (idiot-proof, right?) -  we <br/>
found one with only two of the tabs closed. You've really got to wonder <br/>

We just had some great flood conditions (great if you happen to be a flood<br/>
lookin' to happen) here in northeastern IL last night.  I was absolutely<br/>
compelled to take a break from cleaning my flooded basement, so I went<br/>
looking for the "Big 10 Wolverine" box in DuPage County, expecting it to<br/>
have floated away in a sea of rain.  Not only was it in place but it was<br/>
totally DRY DRY DRY.  It was one of the cheaper plastic containers and<br/>
everything was just single-bagged together -- journal, stamp and markers.<br/>
No way should it have stayed dry.  And it wasn't even really under the kind<br/>
of cover that would have protected it from the rain we had last night.  That<br/>
was one lucky Wolverine.<br/>

One time I went out letterboxing in these spooky woods, it was about  <br/>
this time of year in fact, near Halloween and the sun was going down.  <br/>
Now I know I shouldn't be out there ALONE with the sun going down  <br/>
letterboxing but I just had to get this box. You know what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I found the letterbox called, GET OUT! HE'S IN THE WOODS! box  <br/>
which was a Lock n' Lock box. I was even First Finder. I stamped in  <br/>
near this cave like place and I left, but perhaps not alone. I heard  <br/>
this dragging sound behind me.<br/>
<br/>
I would stop and the sound would stop.<br/>
<br/>
I would start to walk and the dragging would start.<br/>
<br/>
I would check behind me and no one was there. Just the dark woods. A  <br/>
chipmunk limped across the path ahead of me. Injured with a leg  <br/>
missing and an eyepatch over one eye, it just stood there on its  <br/>
haunches staring at me with that one beady black eye. And then it  <br/>
limped away. I swear it was laughing at me, shaking its head.<br/>
<br/>
I started running and the dragging would be always right behind me.  <br/>
It sounded like it was getting closer and even sometimes I think I  <br/>
felt it tug at my pant leg. I was screaming through the paths, "HELP  <br/>
ME HELP ME!  . . . i'm so scared . . ." I was just thinking I knew I  <br/>
should'nt have have kicked that map into the river.<br/>
<br/>
I would dodge this way and that way to see if I could loose whatever  <br/>
it was following me. I would stop behind a tree. Panting. Sure  <br/>
enough, it too would stop. I would sprint to another fork in the path  <br/>
and it would still be behind me. That horrible dragging sound like  <br/>
some deranged one-legged crazy man purposefully dragging that  <br/>
prosthetic leg to make sure I knew it was behind me!<br/>
<br/>
The dragging was quicker and now I heard things bumping around behind  <br/>
me, like the thing was carrying a box of knives to cut me up and put  <br/>
me in! I thought, "I will be made into a grisly letterbox to be found  <br/>
by some poor, unsuspecting, newbie, letterboxing family. 'Look MA I  <br/>
FOUND THE LETTERBOX!!!!!!!!' . . . eeuuuugh.'" but inside I laughed,  <br/>
"that will teach that family to be more discreet."<br/>
<br/>
My legs were getting weak from the running. I was not looking back  <br/>
anymore. Just running. Running for the love of my journal, I was  <br/>
running and the cold sweat dripping down my back was sending chills  <br/>
to my toes. I felt another of the many tugs on my pant leg, but this  <br/>
last one got me. It tripped me up and I lost my footing. Down I went.  <br/>
Face first into the side of path, sprawling and screaming, "OH  <br/>
LETTERBOXING WEBMASTERS HELP MEEEEEEE!!!!!".<br/>
<br/>
And than it had my legs.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't see with all the poison ivy all over my face but I could  <br/>
FEEL the thing had my legs. Screaming for my personal stamp, I  <br/>
prepared for my inevitable demise as the first victim to this  <br/>
horrible letterbox. If I was going to die, I wanted to see my  <br/>
murderer. I don't know why. Maybe it is to haunt him/her for the rest  <br/>
of their horrible lives, make their moments of life a living HELL  <br/>
like what they have done to me in this brief moment of my long, and  <br/>
peaceful life. What kind of a person would do this? It was definitely  <br/>
not an animal, for nature would not hunt and tease their prey as this  <br/>
had. Only the cruel, mean-spirited, human would purposefully create  <br/>
TERROR. What insane person would take the only remaining pure hobby,  <br/>
letterboxing, and make it into a death game? I had to see.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yeah.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One time I went out letterboxing in these spooky woods, it was about<br/>
&gt; this time of year in fact, near Halloween and the sun was going down.<br/>
&gt; Now I know I shouldn't be out there ALONE with the sun going down<br/>
&gt; letterboxing but I just had to get this box. You know what I mean.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I found the letterbox called, GET OUT! HE'S IN THE WOODS! box<br/>
&gt; which was a Lock n' Lock box. I was even First Finder. I stamped in<br/>
&gt; near this cave like place and I left, but perhaps not alone. I heard<br/>
&gt; this dragging sound behind me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would stop and the sound would stop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would start to walk and the dragging would start.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would check behind me and no one was there. Just the dark woods. A<br/>
&gt; chipmunk limped across the path ahead of me. Injured with a leg<br/>
&gt; missing and an eyepatch over one eye, it just stood there on its<br/>
&gt; haunches staring at me with that one beady black eye. And then it<br/>
&gt; limped away. I swear it was laughing at me, shaking its head.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I started running and the dragging would be always right behind me.<br/>
&gt; It sounded like it was getting closer and even sometimes I think I<br/>
&gt; felt it tug at my pant leg. I was screaming through the paths, "HELP<br/>
&gt; ME HELP ME! . . . i'm so scared . . ." I was just thinking I knew I<br/>
&gt; should'nt have have kicked that map into the river.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would dodge this way and that way to see if I could loose whatever<br/>
&gt; it was following me. I would stop behind a tree. Panting. Sure<br/>
&gt; enough, it too would stop. I would sprint to another fork in the path<br/>
&gt; and it would still be behind me. That horrible dragging sound like<br/>
&gt; some deranged one-legged crazy man purposefully dragging that<br/>
&gt; prosthetic leg to make sure I knew it was behind me!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The dragging was quicker and now I heard things bumping around behind<br/>
&gt; me, like the thing was carrying a box of knives to cut me up and put<br/>
&gt; me in! I thought, "I will be made into a grisly letterbox to be found<br/>
&gt; by some poor, unsuspecting, newbie, letterboxing family. 'Look MA I<br/>
&gt; FOUND THE LETTERBOX!!!!!!!!' . . . eeuuuugh.'" but inside I laughed,<br/>
&gt; "that will teach that family to be more discreet."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My legs were getting weak from the running. I was not looking back<br/>
&gt; anymore. Just running. Running for the love of my journal, I was<br/>
&gt; running and the cold sweat dripping down my back was sending chills<br/>
&gt; to my toes. I felt another of the many tugs on my pant leg, but this<br/>
&gt; last one got me. It tripped me up and I lost my footing. Down I went.<br/>
&gt; Face first into the side of path, sprawling and screaming, "OH<br/>
&gt; LETTERBOXING WEBMASTERS HELP MEEEEEEE!!!!!".<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And than it had my legs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I couldn't see with all the poison ivy all over my face but I could<br/>
&gt; FEEL the thing had my legs. Screaming for my personal stamp, I<br/>
&gt; prepared for my inevitable demise as the first victim to this<br/>
&gt; horrible letterbox. If I was going to die, I wanted to see my<br/>
&gt; murderer. I don't know why. Maybe it is to haunt him/her for the rest<br/>
&gt; of their horrible lives, make their moments of life a living HELL<br/>
&gt; like what they have done to me in this brief moment of my long, and<br/>
&gt; peaceful life. What kind of a person would do this? It was definitely<br/>
&gt; not an animal, for nature would not hunt and tease their prey as this<br/>
&gt; had. Only the cruel, mean-spirited, human would purposefully create<br/>
&gt; TERROR. What insane person would take the only remaining pure hobby,<br/>
&gt; letterboxing, and make it into a death game? I had to see.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I turned over, to see . . . there was no one. Silly me, I had<br/>
&gt; "Locked" the Lock N' Lock box to my pant cuff.<br/>

that would make for two new rules in letterboxing. 1. make sure the<br/>
box is replanted..<br/>
and 2. never go boxing alone especially near sundown.<br/>
However, if you were to met someone on the trail and they were to ask,<br/>
"which way is north?" you could say down! I think they would get it.<br/>
You certainly could not deny you were a boxer!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Umm. yeah. We thought the same. Box, tabs, obvious. Right. When we  <br/>
&gt; &gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; maintaining one of our boxes - a Lock &amp; Lock (idiot-proof, right?)  <br/>
&gt; &gt; - we<br/>
&gt; &gt; found one with only two of the tabs closed. You've really got to  <br/>
&gt; &gt; wonder<br/>
&gt; &gt; what people are thinking.<br/>

&gt; Very well done but I can't shake the feeling there is more to this  <br/>
&gt; than<br/>
&gt; meets the eye.<br/>

&gt; Yeah.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One time I went out letterboxing in these spooky woods, it was about<br/>
&gt; this time of year in fact, near Halloween and the sun was going down.<br/>
&gt; Now I know I shouldn't be out there ALONE with the sun going down<br/>
&gt; letterboxing but I just had to get this box. You know what I mean.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I found the letterbox called, GET OUT! HE'S IN THE WOODS! box<br/>
&gt; which was a Lock n' Lock box. I was even First Finder. I stamped in<br/>
&gt; near this cave like place and I left, but perhaps not alone. I heard<br/>
&gt; this dragging sound behind me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would stop and the sound would stop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would start to walk and the dragging would start.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would check behind me and no one was there. Just the dark woods. A<br/>
&gt; chipmunk limped across the path ahead of me. Injured with a leg<br/>
&gt; missing and an eyepatch over one eye, it just stood there on its<br/>
&gt; haunches staring at me with that one beady black eye. And then it<br/>
&gt; limped away. I swear it was laughing at me, shaking its head.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I started running and the dragging would be always right behind me.<br/>
&gt; It sounded like it was getting closer and even sometimes I think I<br/>
&gt; felt it tug at my pant leg. I was screaming through the paths, "HELP<br/>
&gt; ME HELP ME! . . . i'm so scared . . ." I was just thinking I knew I<br/>
&gt; should'nt have have kicked that map into the river.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would dodge this way and that way to see if I could loose whatever<br/>
&gt; it was following me. I would stop behind a tree. Panting. Sure<br/>
&gt; enough, it too would stop. I would sprint to another fork in the path<br/>
&gt; and it would still be behind me. That horrible dragging sound like<br/>
&gt; some deranged one-legged crazy man purposefully dragging that<br/>
&gt; prosthetic leg to make sure I knew it was behind me!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The dragging was quicker and now I heard things bumping around behind<br/>
&gt; me, like the thing was carrying a box of knives to cut me up and put<br/>
&gt; me in! I thought, "I will be made into a grisly letterbox to be found<br/>
&gt; by some poor, unsuspecting, newbie, letterboxing family. 'Look MA I<br/>
&gt; FOUND THE LETTERBOX!!!!!!!!' . . . eeuuuugh.'" but inside I laughed,<br/>
&gt; "that will teach that family to be more discreet."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My legs were getting weak from the running. I was not looking back<br/>
&gt; anymore. Just running. Running for the love of my journal, I was<br/>
&gt; running and the cold sweat dripping down my back was sending chills<br/>
&gt; to my toes. I felt another of the many tugs on my pant leg, but this<br/>
&gt; last one got me. It tripped me up and I lost my footing. Down I went.<br/>
&gt; Face first into the side of path, sprawling and screaming, "OH<br/>
&gt; LETTERBOXING WEBMASTERS HELP MEEEEEEE!!!!!".<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And than it had my legs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I couldn't see with all the poison ivy all over my face but I could<br/>
&gt; FEEL the thing had my legs. Screaming for my personal stamp, I<br/>
&gt; prepared for my inevitable demise as the first victim to this<br/>
&gt; horrible letterbox. If I was going to die, I wanted to see my<br/>
&gt; murderer. I don't know why. Maybe it is to haunt him/her for the rest<br/>
&gt; of their horrible lives, make their moments of life a living HELL<br/>
&gt; like what they have done to me in this brief moment of my long, and<br/>
&gt; peaceful life. What kind of a person would do this? It was definitely<br/>
&gt; not an animal, for nature would not hunt and tease their prey as this<br/>
&gt; had. Only the cruel, mean-spirited, human would purposefully create<br/>
&gt; TERROR. What insane person would take the only remaining pure hobby,<br/>
&gt; letterboxing, and make it into a death game? I had to see.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I turned over, to see . . . there was no one. Silly me, I had<br/>
&gt; "Locked" the Lock N' Lock box to my pant cuff.<br/>
