                    <div class="plaintext-content">i have just returned from my first attempt to BWT (Box with a <br/>
Toddler, LOL!).  we tried the happy dog series located in miami-<br/>
whitewater park, hamilton, oh.  although i did not answer many of the <br/>
clues correctly (guess i need to learn more about my pet dogs!!! LOL) <br/>
we, maggie and i, were able to locate all three boxes plus <br/>
franzsolo's bonus box.  i will fess up and state that we received <br/>
help from a young couple who have just recently started boxing in the <br/>
cini area...jim and heather.  real nice folk.  but after that, we <br/>
found them on our own...with wrong answers!!<br/>
<br/>
anyway, all boxes are there and in fine shape..although the logs need <br/>
to be replaced since they are just about filled.<br/>
