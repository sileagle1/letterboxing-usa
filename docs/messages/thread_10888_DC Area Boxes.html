                    <html><body>Hello all!  I've just come back from a great two days in DC!  Thankfully enough, there wasn't nearly as much snow as I thought there would be, however, it still hampered boxing!  One thing I've learned about DC/MD/VA is, THEY NEED TO LEARN HOW TO PLOW!!! :-)  On Friday, they were still in a state of emergency, and most of the school districts did not have school all week!  If CT hadn't had this week as school vacation, we would have only missed Tuesday (Mon. being a holiday)....!  The main streets in the area were clear, however, when I traveled the side streets of Alexandria, they still had A LOT of snow still on them!  Not only that, but the parking area for Jones Point hadn't even been plowed, and from what I hear, its municipal parking!  I actually got my car stuck in the lot and a very nice lady in an SUV helped push me out!  Thankfully, I have a front wheel drive car!  When I got back from planting the Jones Point Lighthouse box, a Volvo got stuck in the same parking lot, and I tried to push her out, but she had rear wheel drive, and was TOTALLY stuck!  I went down to the nearby construction site and had a couple of big good looking guys come and help her out!
<br/>
<br/>Anyway, as you know, I planted two boxes in the area while I was there: Concord Point Lighthouse and Jones Point Lighthouse.  BTW.... I think Tom (aka Scarab) from the Doubtful Guests, is going to check on my Jones Point one to make sure it doesn't float out to sea if the Potomac starts rising, however, if there is anyone in Alexandria who would be willing to also check for me, that would be great!
<br/>
<br/>Now to the boxes!  On Thursday night, I was victorious in finding the McKeldin Library stamp (great hiding place!), and I attempted to find Stinkeye, however Stinkeye has gone missing (NewBe1, his wife, son Brennan, and I checked back today to find Stinkeye and it still wasn't there).  Friday a.m, I was victorious in finding the Smithsonian, Orion the Hunter, and Egypt Explorer.  I met up with Tom (aka Scarab) in Chinatown and he was very nice to get the Year of the Ram LB down from its hiding place, since I was not tall enough to do it stealthily!  I also sent the STS 107 Columbia HH on its way.  After exchanging with Tom, he and I had lunch and then went out to find The Inventor and Skull and Bones.  We were successful, after quite a bit of digging in the snow!  I was so wet by that time, that I called it a day and headed back to the hotel to warm up!
<br/>
<br/>On Sat. I met up with NewBe1 and his family at the WaWa near Stinkeye to exchange and LB, however, as I said before, not able to find Stinkeye :-(
<br/>
<br/>All in all, a great weekend!  A very special THANK YOU to NewBe1 and his family, and Scarab for the exchanges and conversation!  It was nice to meet you!  (and Tom, hopefully, I'll get to meet the rest of the family next time!)
<br/>
<br/>Happy Hunting everyone!
