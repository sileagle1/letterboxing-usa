many, <br/>
&gt; leave behind particles during the rubbing process. These <br/>
particles/fibers expand <br/>
&gt; when they get wet (ie rain). This in turn breaks down the stone's <br/>
surface very <br/>
&gt; quickly. <br/>

Sorry to drift off topic, but as cemetery preservation volunteers, <br/>
this is one that's dear to our hearts. Kind of like the question <br/>
about "should we even box in cemeteries," there are lots of differing <br/>
opinions on doing headstone rubbings. More and more of the New <br/>
England cemeteries we're aware of are discouraging this wonderful <br/>
practice. It's mainly a wear and tear issue...kind of like staying on-<br/>
trail as much as possible. For those interested, here are a couple of <br/>
terrific links on the subject.<br/>
