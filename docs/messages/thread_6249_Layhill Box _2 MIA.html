We searched the area described in the clue for an hour, but we think that if<br/>
the box is still there, the clues need to be rewrittern - the area is<br/>
overgrown and certain features described in the clue have been obfuscated.*<br/>
Please advise!<br/>

Highlight the following text, as it may contain spoilers:<br/>
*At the white building box, the arching vine by the trailside is one of many<br/>
in the area - most of that specific area is over-grown with vines, all of<br/>
which arch.  The undergrowth there is very dense, and it was hard work<br/>
wacking away at some of the foliage.  The most prevalent arching vine<br/>
structure was searched and the letterbox was not found.  the juniper box was<br/>
in-place but hadn't been stamped in a long time.<br/>
