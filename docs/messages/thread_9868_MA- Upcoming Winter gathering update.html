<br/>
<br/>Just to let you know...
<br/>So far we have about 20 people that have RSVP'd. Yay!
<br/>
<br/>I haven't heard whether Deanne B.B. (aka the lazy letterboxer) has found a ride up from the Cape yet. I think Warriorwoman was also looking for a lift from the Metrowest area. Post to them if you can give them a hand...er... I mean...ride.
<br/>
<br/>I have carved an event stamp and am going to try to place a new box just for the occasion. I am very excited to see you all.
<br/>
<br/>I also want to reiterate the invitation to anyone that may not yet have heard. We will be gathering for a potluck at 12 noon on Saturday January 18th at the Moose Hill Wildlife Sanctuary in Sharon, MA. We will be gathering inside the Nature Center. (Sorry, no pets)
<br/>
<br/>I will be providing the hot and cold beverages and an appetizer. So bring a favorite dish to share (and the recipe) and your favorite letterboxing buddies.
<br/>
<br/>If you are planning on coming, please RSVP to the list or to me privately (or to cscm@toast.net) so we will know how many to plan for (tables and chairs and soda etc). 
<br/>
<br/>See you soon!

Sharon (Moose Hill) is approximately 30 minutes from Providence. Just come up I95 and get off at Exit 8 (Main St.Sharon) and follow the signs :) <br/>

Hey Rustypuff!<br/>
<br/>
I am all set on transportation.  Since the event is in daylight and <br/>
not a zillion miles away, I'm driving myself (and two children).  I'm <br/>
trying to get Mary (RI) and Safari Man to come, too.<br/>
<br/>
If, however, it rains or snows, I'll have to bow out.<br/>
<br/>
And I'll leave the event an hour before dusk.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the concern, pal o' mine!<br/>
<br/>
WarriorWoman<br/>
<br/>
p.s.  Tell CSCM that I'm halfway through an HPL anthology "Dunwich <br/>
Horrors and others".  He'll get a kick out of that.  Hmmm.  Perhaps <br/>
I'll do an HPL series of LBs ....<br/>

&gt; Exit 8<br/>
&gt; Take a Right off exit on Main<br/>
&gt; Take Left onto Moose Hill<br/>

Yes and once on Moose Hill Street, follow it straight (it will cross Walpole Street in a crooked way, but stay straight and follow the signs). Be careful of the dangerous "S" curve. Soon after you will come upon the junction with Moose Hill PARKWAY. We are right at the junction of Moose Hill STREET and Moose Hill PARKWAY (just to make life interesting). Turn right onto the Parkway to enter the parking lot. I probably should add that we should all try to park rather closely to make sure all can fit.<br/>

See you soon!<br/>
