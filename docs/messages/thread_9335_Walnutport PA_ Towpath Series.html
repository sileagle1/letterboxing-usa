"Indian Grinding Stone" and "Root Celler". We were dissipointed to miss <br/>
seeing the "stone",(I really wanted to see that), and since we did not bring <br/>
a boat the 1st box was not to be. This box must have been planted earlier <br/>
during the long drought!!!<br/>
We did locate the 2nd box and enjoyed a walk uptown into Slatington for <br/>
breakfast at a diner that was a journey back in time! Good weather, a good <br/>
friend, good food and a good time!!<br/>
Thanks Diver Dan!<br/>
Enjoy life!<br/>
'Box On!<br/>
