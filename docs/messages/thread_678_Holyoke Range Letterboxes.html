                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Bonnie. We absolutely LOVE the three separate parks that make<br/>
up that amazing ridge. The Holyoke basalt lava flow extended down into<br/>
our home area in southern connecticut also, and the M&amp;M trail is<br/>
therefore just spectacular even before reaching Monadnock. Bonnie, we<br/>
loved your boxes on the M&amp;M at Wendell, and you were our inspiration<br/>
that we could indeed foray into carving our own. We've "boxed" the two<br/>
northern sections of the Holyoke (Skinner State Park and Mt<br/>
Norrowotock). Maybe we should get together for the southern section at<br/>
Mt Tom and do a joint effort. I'll bring the kids if you'll bring the<br/>
stamps!<br/>

&gt; Wow, I had NO IDEA boxes were hidden on the Holyoke Range in Amherst,<br/>
Mass!  <br/>
&gt; This is my back door, can't wait to go hunting there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your web page looks great.  I am taking an HTML workshop next month,<br/>
so <br/>
&gt; hopefully soon I will no longer need to bother Tom Cooch with setting<br/>
up my <br/>
&gt; clues on the web either.  Interesting how this hobby is prompting us<br/>
all to <br/>
&gt; grow in our knowledge, indoors and out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nice work, and thanks!<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Happy Sunday, all. We had the most terrificly incredible fall day<br/>
here<br/>
&gt; &gt;in New England. Hope your weekend was great too.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I'm writing to specially thank Tom Cooch for all his work on getting<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; &gt;clues up: I've been working on a web page and had no idea what a<br/>
&gt; &gt;limited, archaic, testy, quirky business web publishing was. It<br/>
reminds<br/>
&gt; &gt;me of word processing 10 years ago (the dark ages in computer-years)<br/>
&gt; &gt;before it got so easy my 8 year old could do it. html is a PAIN!<br/>
&gt; &gt;Anybody remember wysiwyg? Give me a break! But it's been kind of fun<br/>
&gt; &gt;too, which is weird enough that I'm not sure I want it known in<br/>
public.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So anyway, I thought I'd ask a few of my friends to test drive my new<br/>
&gt; &gt;first web site to see if it works and loads fast and is visually<br/>
&gt; &gt;pleasing to a discerning crowd. Please check it out at:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;http://members.aol.com/drewclan/index.htm<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;....and give me your feed back (probably off the list might be<br/>
&gt; &gt;better?). As a bonus, there are some new clues there that haven't<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; &gt;seen outside our little local community.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks, Tom! Jay<br/>
