Letterbox hidden on 6-24-02 at 2pm by J&amp;G with nephew Stevie <br/>
<br/>
Stamp Design: Spider Web   (B-947 Petaluma ,CA)<br/>
<br/>
Distance one way: 2.78 miles<br/>
<br/>
Terrain Difficulty: Moderate and Tricky - 3/4's of the way follows the<br/>
Sander's Kill stream passing several pools of water and slippery rocks.<br/>
<br/>
No drinkable water along the way without filtration.<br/>
<br/>
Optional Equipment: Step Counter, GPS<br/>
<br/>
Bug Repellent may be needed!<br/>
<br/>
Directions /Clues:<br/>
<br/>
1) We parked our Caravan in first loop on the Long Path at Jenny Lane on<br/>
44/55<br/>
<br/>
  There are two ways to do this from here: Either follow the stream all<br/>
the way down to the falls  or the easier way - on a path through the<br/>
woods. <br/>
<br/>
Path through woods:<br/>
<br/>
2) Walk for one mile 40 degrees True North first passing the last parking<br/>
loop and two little fields followed by a high grass covered path  for a<br/>
total number of  2465 steps. If you see a posted sign at about 1900 steps<br/>
[41 45 04N , 74 14 24W on a GPS]  this trail leads to the next point ,<br/>
about 300 yards around this land. { in the past we have  bushwhacked here<br/>
to the stream with our dog  "BUD" , it is a more difficult way to go, but<br/>
keeps you off private land}<br/>
3) The path on private land is for about 300 yards and there is a  grassy<br/>
clearing at this point where a sharp right turn for one tenth of a mile<br/>
in a southerly direction  brings you back to the stream. <br/>
4) At this spot is a  hunters cabin.<br/>
5) The path continues around the back of the cabin and heads downstream<br/>
for a half of a mile.<br/>
6) At that point , within the next hundred feet or so, cross over  the<br/>
stream. ( total steps now about 3826)<br/>
7)Walking  down the right side of the steam for another 1/2 mile you will<br/>
pass posted land on the other side.<br/>
8) At about 5181 steps or about 2.1 miles make a sharp right up tributary<br/>
stream up to falls. ( approx. 150 yards)<br/>
9) At the top of the falls - go across the brook - the trail goes right<br/>
and left - go  left (over a small log) and continue a few hundred feet <br/>
across a marshy area to another fork. <br/>
10) Do not take the left path, down  into the woods!  Take the right path<br/>
to the  flat rock area . <br/>
Go to the  left edge of the flat rock field , There is a path here<br/>
through the mountain laurel heading uphill in a southerly direction.<br/>
11) Here is where it gets tricky!  Head to the top of the mountain (SE<br/>
140 degrees) and keep to the middle path. Watch out for false side paths.<br/>
At about 6185 steps you will go over a small 2 foot rock wedged on trail<br/>
being used as a bridge over a small crevice. About another 300 yards to<br/>
Hidden Pond!<br/>
12)Letterbox is 75 feet  uphill (190 degrees South) from the  flat rocks<br/>
on waters edge where its a good place to have a snack.  There are two<br/>
yellow paint splashes on  the two rocks there,  one big ,one small ,about<br/>
10 feet  or so apart from each other, under the big rock is the box which<br/>
has another small rock covering it.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck and have fun finding it!<br/>
