We thought it might be. A small group of us went out<br/>
there about two weeks ago, and we were fairly sure we<br/>
had the right spot. Even found a suspicious looking<br/>
small pile of rocks, but no box.<br/>
<br/>
It's a great spot, easy to get to, well worth the<br/>
effort, and it appears to be one of those places that<br/>
no one goes to because no one knows about it. I can<br/>
say with some authority that, if you replant there,<br/>
we'll go back. <br/>
<br/>
Besides, have to go back and see what it's like in the<br/>
fall!<br/>
