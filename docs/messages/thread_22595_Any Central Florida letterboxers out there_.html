                    <div class="plaintext-content">In late August I planted a letterbox in memory of my dad in one of his<br/>
favorite places in Palm Bay, Florida. Nobody has logged in as having<br/>
found it yet. On Cape Cod the boxes that Archimedes' Screw and  plant<br/>
are found and logged in the same day or the next at the latest. There<br/>
were not many letterboxes in the Melbourne area where I was staying<br/>
but I really enjoyed the ones I found. "Jeannie's Home" was one of the<br/>
coolest little boxes with a terrific stamp and great hiding place on<br/>
Cocoa Beach. We were either the first or second finders and the box<br/>
had been planted in June. Maybe the season wasn't right but being from<br/>
New England I was surprised more people weren't out there searching<br/>
for these boxes. It was a bit hot and humid but after digging around<br/>
the melting remains of 30 inch snowstorms it was a piece of cake. So,<br/>
Central Florida, get out there and box! Find Jeannie's Home and<br/>
Grandpa Dick's letterboxes at the very least.<br/>

thing, we definitely don't have the number of boxers in the area that y'all <br/>
have in the NE, and for another, summer is SO not the time to go boxing down <br/>
here.   probably 90 percent of our finds happen in the winter, when it's more <br/>
comfortable and when we get visitors from the north who box here on vacation.   <br/>
I know I haven't stuck my nose outside the door since June, and probably won't <br/>
until late October!<br/>

Wow, I'd go nuts not being able to find a box for such a long time.<br/>
Well, here's wishing you a cold snap.<br/>
