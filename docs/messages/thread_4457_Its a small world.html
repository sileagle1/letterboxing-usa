to be in the way of Louie the Cat's escape route from Maggie the Dog's <br/>
drooling mouth- but I am not quite sure since I was half asleep- BUT that is <br/>
another story...) in walks Jay Drew...  Upon his introduction I thought- <br/>
could it be true?  THE Jay Drew of letterboxing fame was going to attend to <br/>
my eye?  Indeed- it was the same Jay.  I guess that explains all of the drug <br/>
company pens in his boxes!  <br/>
Many thanks for your help today!<br/>

my benefit as I got to meet another wonderful letterboxer! Stephani, <br/>
I didn't think to ask for an "X" after your visit! (Oops, today, Feb <br/>
14th, that could look like x, as in xoxox! Hope John doesn't mind!) <br/>
Maybe next time the kids have a tussle and you get in the middle we <br/>
could exchange stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Great to meetcha!<br/>
Jay, hoping your eye is much better this morning<br/>
