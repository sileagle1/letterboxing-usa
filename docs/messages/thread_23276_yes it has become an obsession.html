&gt; welcome to the addiction/obsession donna. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; to answer your first question i would suggest that you look at who <br/>
der mad<br/>
&gt; stamper is. could be real. could be fake. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; as a good starting off point for you i would suggest you join the <br/>
newboxers<br/>
&gt; group. you can find them at  <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; you will find the folks at the newboxers group a friendly bunch. <br/>
not that we<br/>
&gt; are not friendly here, well, sometimes not. but you have to know <br/>
us to love<br/>
&gt; us!<br/>

&gt; Hi you people are alot funnier than my other Yahoo group-the New <br/>
&gt; England Springer Spaniel rescue. <br/>
&gt; I tried fostering but get too attached to the dogs and afraid I <br/>
will <br/>
&gt; flunk. As for letterboxing. one of my dogs sniffed out a box and <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; is how I got hooked.<br/>
&gt; I live in Lunenburg and found 7 boxes on the Cracked Pots Series . <br/>
My <br/>
&gt; daughter and I spent Easter find boxes , stamping our book , the <br/>
book <br/>
&gt; in the box and hiding it back. WHat fun- thank you so much.<br/>
&gt; Did the tragedy mystery get solved. That was sooo funny. The woman <br/>
&gt; has talent as a writer. I know you all carve stamps but I have not <br/>
&gt; idea what white PV is , I use pencil erasers for stamps. I am <br/>
addicted <br/>
&gt; now .<br/>
&gt; Thanks alot ,like I have nothing to do with my time 60 hour week <br/>
job, <br/>
&gt; a home , a dog to find a forever home for , looking for a mate , <br/>
doing <br/>
&gt; Yoga , going to Kripalu center , cleaning , paperwork and now <br/>
&gt; Letterboxing oh my.<br/>
