                    <html><body>I found the Sheep on the Hill on July 27, 2002.  It is quite tricky.  One quick note is that if you don't find the obvious cairn, then you're looking in the wrong place!  We found that out when we looked for an hour in the wrong place (sigh).  Just as you get into the woods, there is a group of boulders on your left, then many stone walls.  There are even paths to these stone walls, suggesting that people had trodded there looking for the boxes.  THIS IS THE WRONG PLACE!  You need to go quite far into the woods to a very obvious cairn and look in the stone wall behind it.  Also, it is not really the correct pacing from the path as the clues present.  It is more like about four feet (perhaps seven small steps rather than paces).
