&gt; It almost seems more logical, rather than a single state contact <br/>
&gt; person, to have all in a given state, who are interested &amp; willing...<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to start initializing this in the near future.  I'll leave the State<br/>
Contacts map exactly as it is now, except when you click on it to send a<br/>
message, the message will be addressed to a list that will forward it to<br/>
anyone who wants to be included as a contact for that state.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you want to help greet newcomers from your home state and answer some<br/>
of their questions about how to get started, please let me know by contacting<br/>
me directly or through this discussion group.<br/>
<br/>
Also let me know if you are interested in serving as a temporary contact<br/>
person for some of your neighboring states that are currently unrepresented.<br/>
<br/>
As a state contact person, your responsibilities will be minimal.  The answers<br/>
to most questions that a newcomer might have can be found on our list of<br/>
Frequently Asked Questions, located at http://www.pclink.com/elf/faq.txt<br/>
<br/>
More importantly, volunteering will give you the opportunity to make new<br/>
friends and help convey the warmth and hospitality that have become such a<br/>
part of our hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Mitch<br/>

Count me in for the contact list for VT. AS NH, MA, and NY are<br/>
represented, I guess I'm limited to VT.<br/>

The FAQ's page deals mainly with the mechanics of this Talk List - don't<br/>
forget to point newcomers to the "Getting Started" page,<br/>
at:http://www.pclink.com/elf/letbox.htm<br/>
<br/>
This page may be something that people wish to add their experiences to,<br/>
especuially with all the recent discussions about Uncle Walter, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking the lead in this.<br/>
