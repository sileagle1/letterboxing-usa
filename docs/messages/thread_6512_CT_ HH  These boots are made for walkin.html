the closet and back on the trail.  I normally try to send a HH on its <br/>
way ASAP, however the day after finding this one, my house burnt down <br/>
( good thing the l.boxing gear was in my car).  In addition, my  <br/>
hiking partners father became fatally ill. Now that things are lookin <br/>
right side up again (almost), I am a happy hiker again!  By the way, <br/>
has anyone seen HH, underground railroad?  Thanx and happy trails!  <br/>
