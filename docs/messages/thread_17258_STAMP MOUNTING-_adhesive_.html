&gt; quick question. for those of you who are mounting their stamps on<br/>
&gt; craft foam, what kind of adhesive do you use? crazy glue doesn't seem<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have found a glue called Elmers Craft Bond Ultra Stix All. It says "It's the only glue you ever need". I tossed the package, but it said it basically sticks anything to anything, remains flexible, dries fast &amp; clear, etc. etc. Everything you'd want in a glue :-) <br/>
<br/>
I used to use wood to mount my stamps, but found it warped (usually concave so you couldn't ink the center of the stamp). Now I use the thick, stiff but flexible foam and really like it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In my experience, I have used "Liquid Nails" glue (found at Home<br/>
Depot) for mounting most types of rubber to wood.<br/>
<br/>
I mount to aspen boards. Usually wood will work if it's thick enough<br/>
and not for a large stamp. If you get up to 2.5x3inch or larger you<br/>
need to make sure you have wood that won't warp. Additionally, to<br/>
prevent that, I use a wood sealer and acrylic finish that<br/>
waterproofs/seals the wood.<br/>
<br/>
A thin coat of light/clear wood varnish is also an option. Wood looks<br/>
very nice, it smooths the edges and you can also preserve a beautiful<br/>
impression of your stamp on the back - very professional!<br/>
<br/>
I've also seen small, thin and square pieces of slate used. I like that!<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps<br/>
