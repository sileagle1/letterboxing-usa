  I guess this is a little off topic, but I am looking for <br/>
suggestions for a light weight (summer) hiking shoe with ankle <br/>
support (due to multiple past sprains).<br/>
  I hate the heat -- my favorite walking shoe for summer has been a <br/>
Teva sandle with a sturdy gripping sole. I haven't had any accidents <br/>
while wearing those, but I think I am tempting fate. (Also, we are <br/>
planning a vacation to Glacier National Park with lots of walking).<br/>
   So, if you have a favorite brand to suggest that is not real <br/>
heavy or hot, please let me know. Maybe email me off-list so I don't <br/>
bug people about this side-topic message!<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Kim ~<br/>
I don't think that is off topic at all - we all have to wear something on our feet when we hike, right?  Personally, I would love to hear people's suggestions.  I have a good pair of rugged hiking boots but as you say, they really aren't the greatest in the heat of summer.<br/>
Now, for something TRULY off topic ~ are you a totally addicted cavy lover?  :-)<br/>
