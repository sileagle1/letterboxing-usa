But even when I was hiking past, I was thinking, 'hey, that looks like a good place to meet!'  Not that we'd actually stay there, but we could at least meet there.<br/>

Exactly one year ago today we crossed that very bridge in Harpers <br/>
Ferry!  What a beautiful spot (especially when it isn't flooded)!  <br/>
Too bad, we're off by a year in our travels...  :(<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the gathering &amp; way to go, Ryan!  You totally amaze us! If <br/>
only we could attempt 1/10th of what you've accomplished already!!!<br/>
