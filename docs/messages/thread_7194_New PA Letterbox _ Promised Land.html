<div align="left">Hello fellow letterboxers ~</div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left">While visiting relatives in Pennsylvania this weekend we were 
disappointed to find that there were no Letterboxes in their immediate 
area.  I pulled out my carving tools and got to work.  We planted this 
one in the pouring rain Saturday morning.  We hope you enjoy 
it.   We will be back in Pennsylvania the end of next month and hope 
to plant several more, probably in Wayne county since there are none 
there. </div>

<div align="left"><strong>A little history about Promised Land State 
Park:</strong></div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left">The land that became Promised Land State Park was hunting 
grounds for the Minsi Tribe of the Wolf Clan of the Lenni-Lenape Indians 
(Delaware).</div>
<div align="left">
<p>Local tradition holds that the land was promised farmland for the religious 
group the Shakers. The Shakers found that the land was too rocky for farming. 
The Shakers departed, leaving the land sarcastically named the Promised 
Land.</p>
<p>Early settlers of the area erected sawmills to process the large stands of 
conifer and hardwood trees. The land was repeatedly clear-cut. With the loss of 
trees came erosion and forest fires, and migration of wildlife from the 
area.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania purchased the land in 1902. Promised Land 
was the fourth Pennsylvania state park. The Commonwealth worked to protect and 
reclaim the area and the forest and wildlife began to return. </p>
<p>The first park facilities were open to the public in 1905. Many additional 
park facilities were built in the 1930s by Camp S-139 of the Civilian 
Conservation Corps (<acronym title="Civilian conservation corps">CCC</acronym>) 
who also built roads, bridges and dams, and planted thousands of trees. </p>
<p>On Sunday evening, May 31, 1998, an F-2 tornado (winds of 113 -157 mph) 
passed through Promised Land State Park. It cut a northeasterly path through the 
park and crossed Lower Lake Road, SR 390 and North Shore Road near Sucker Brook. 
Over 500 people were trapped overnight in the park, but no one was seriously 
hurt. The park office has copies of After the Wind Died Down, a booklet about 
the tornado and its aftermath.</p>
<p><strong>Now, on to the letterbox...........</strong></p></div>
<div align="left">Take Route 84 to exit 26.  Proceed south on Route 390 for 
3.5 miles.  On your right will be the "Lake Store" convenience store.  
Immediately make a left onto (unmarked) Park Avenue.  Go approximately 1/2 
mile and make a left into the "Conservation Island" parking area 
and park.  Walk over the stone bridge that will take you to 
"Conservation Island".  Take the main trail on your left, keeping the lake 
on your left.  As you walk along the trial, notice the fallen trees that 
were the effects of the May 1998 tornado.</div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left">Continue on this trail until you come to a very large 5 trunk 
tree at 190 degrees.  The treasure you seek is on the west side under a 
slab at the base of the tree.  Be discreet as this is a busy 
trail.   Replace box and return to trail ~ continue in 
the direction you were heading, back to the parking area.</div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left">Enjoy your hike and thanks for visiting us!</div>
