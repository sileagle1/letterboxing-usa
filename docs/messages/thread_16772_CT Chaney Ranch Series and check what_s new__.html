                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi to all.  We have had a wonderful weekend enjoying the crisp <br/>
weather and crackly leaves under foot.  They do cover up some foot <br/>
grabbing hazards, so be careful!! We did B'fly's and W+P's Chaney <br/>
Ranch series this morning. Thanks guys- it was a wonderful hike and <br/>
all the boxes were found and in great shape.  We wound up doing it <br/>
backwards because we missed the trail to the left on the way in.  The <br/>
first blue disc is up the trail a bit.  Backwards was challenging and <br/>
fun- only had to backtrack for one box.  Yesterday was spent on <br/>
mystery boxes.  A wonderful WINDY day. And BTW- check out what's new- <br/>
my birthday box is now planted-- not too tough a mystery.  So get out <br/>
and enjoy!!!-Sunshine :0) <br/>
