LETTERBOX NAME: Hawk Watch<br/>
DATE Placed: September 21, 2002<br/>
LOCATION: Putney Mountain, Windham County, Vermont<br/>
NEAREST TOWN: Putney, Vermont<br/>
<br/>
Easy 20 minute hike to the top of the mountain. Great for all ages.<br/>
HIGHLIGHTS: The view is exceptional: to the east is New Hampshire's White <br/>
Mountain range and to the west and north are Vermont's Green Mountains. <br/>
 From late August through November there are 14 varieties of hawks <br/>
migrating to the south from Canada. If you are a bird enthusiast, bring <br/>
your binoculars.<br/>
ADDED INFORMATION : There are no bathroom facilities or picnic tables. In <br/>
the center of the town of Putney there is a General Store and the Putney <br/>
Diner which has excellent home cooking for very reasonable prices.<br/>
DIRECTIONS: To reach Putney Mountain Hawk Watch, take exit 4 off I-91 in <br/>
Vermont, and drive north on Route 5 about 1 mile to the center of Putney. <br/>
At Putney Center, take a left onto the Westminister West Road, and follow <br/>
that road for 1.1 miles. Turn left onto West Mill Road, and follow it for <br/>
2.4 miles. Turn right onto Putney Mountain Road, then immediately bear <br/>
right at the fork. Stay on Putney Mountain Road for 2 miles. Turn right <br/>
onto Putney Mountain Trail Head. There is an open space for parking where <br/>
you can park at the start of the trail. Follow the warn path up the <br/>
mountain. It is about a 20 minute hike up the trail to the clearing and the <br/>
Hawk Watch.<br/>
TO FIND THE LETTERBOX: When you reach the clearing, look for the highest <br/>
level of rock area and proceed to that area. You will notice several 6 inch <br/>
markers inlaid in the rocks which are US Geological Survey markers. Of the <br/>
several markers there is only one bright brass marker. Find the brass <br/>
marker and stand on it facing north. Locate 340 degrees on your compass and <br/>
walk 22 paces walking over four or five large rocks. Turn 135 degrees to <br/>
your right and you will be facing a square rock with "wine lips". You will <br/>
be tempted to kiss the rock when you find the Hawk Watch letterbox under <br/>
the rock. Have fun!<br/>
