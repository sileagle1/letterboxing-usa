<br/>
     Today, a spokesman from the local community involved with the <br/>
search of Gingerbread Jim, has started to come to the harsh reality, <br/>
that time may be running out. With only 11 days left before funds run <br/>
dry from the search party fund, volunteers has become frustrated by <br/>
the lack of clues found during the search.<br/>
     "This weather seems to be getting worse everyday we come out <br/>
here to look. We are limited to several hours before retreating for <br/>
warmth." says the spokesman. "If it would only warm up. Things would <br/>
be much easier on us."<br/>
     It seems to be a growing concern as it was in the beginning, <br/>
except now, winter has finally shown her ugly face. Gingerbread Jim <br/>
is somewhere in the woods of New Hampshire, but where? The <br/>
temperatures have dipped close to 0 degrees in most parts of the <br/>
state over the past week, and the forcast doesn't look to be any <br/>
better.<br/>
     There has been some good news though. A few days ago, a cookie <br/>
crumb was found. Unfortunately no other details as to the location of <br/>
the finding have been released due to the kidnapper being still at <br/>
large.<br/>
     If you would like to volunteer in the search for Gingerbread <br/>
Jim, you are asked to be aware of your surroundings. With the ice and <br/>
thin layer of snow on the ground, it can be slick at times. So please <br/>
take your time, but hurry up as well. <br/>
