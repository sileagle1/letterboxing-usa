<br/>
Placed for the Massachusetts Winter Gathering in January 2003, this <br/>
is one is short and easy for families with young children. Be sure to <br/>
bring clues for the many other letterboxes in this wonderful preserve.<br/>
<br/>
The Moose Hill Wildlife Sanctuary is in Sharon, MA. Trails are open <br/>
from dawn to dusk: there is a nominal fee to help with maintenance. <br/>
Sorry, no pets.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From the north on southbound I-95, take exit 10 and go <br/>
left off the ramp. Take the first right onto High Plain St (Rte. 27) <br/>
and then left onto Moose Hill St. Next turn left onto Moose Hill <br/>
Parkway at the big white house and find the parking lot just on your <br/>
left.<br/>
