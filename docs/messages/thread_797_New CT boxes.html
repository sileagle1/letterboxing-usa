somewhere back in November: good luck!<br/>
<br/>
Sherlock's Home<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: two letterboxes on an easy 2-3 miles along very scenic<br/>
Connecticut River cliffs.<br/>
<br/>
Location: Gillette Castle State Park, East Haddam Connecticut, on Rte.<br/>
148. Accessible from Routes 9, 2, 156, and I-95. William Gillette,<br/>
famous for his Broadway portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, built this 24<br/>
room fieldstone house in 1919, and surrounded it with a miniature<br/>
railroad. Some of the old railways are now hiking trails. At the time<br/>
these letterboxes were placed, the trails and castle itself were<br/>
undergoing renovation. The trails are open to hikers without a fee, but<br/>
when renovations to the castle are complete there will be a fee to<br/>
visit. Sorry, no dogs or bikes, but we highly recommend it!<br/>
<br/>
"Mrs Houston? Oh Mrs Houston," called Mr Gillette. It was a quiet<br/>
evening in our study at the big fieldstone house on the Connecticut<br/>
River. William had spent the day in New York, getting ready to portray<br/>
Sherlock Holmes on stage for the first time, and he was tired. He had<br/>
disagreed with his director over acting styles, and now he wanted a<br/>
pipe by the fire and a glass of wine from<br/>
our housekeeper.<br/>
<br/>
"Mrs Houston!"<br/>
<br/>
221B Baker Street seemed a million miles away. Gillette kicked off his<br/>
Persian slippers and pulled on his deerstalker cap, and headed out for<br/>
a walk. He needed some new elements to bring his Sherlock to life. He<br/>
went out behind the Castle to walk his railroad tracks, where he did<br/>
his bestthinking. Facing the house, he found that the setting sun was<br/>
in his eyes, so he turned left and<br/>
walked downhill on the road "to the river." As the road bent right,<br/>
William turned left onto one of his favorite trails, and followed it<br/>
down until it wrapped to the left. A short way before the trail<br/>
regained the road, William stepped to the left and sat down on a flat<br/>
waist high boulder, one of his<br/>
favorite places to think. He lit a pipe, his favorite Calabash, and it<br/>
came to him! He would give Sherlock Holmes a pipe onstage! Unnoticed,<br/>
his box of tobacco dropped behind him and wedged under the boulder, for<br/>
future fans to discover.<br/>
<br/>
He ran back uphill with his lanky gait, holding onto his cap. He met me<br/>
behind the castle, and when I asked if he had any inspiration, he<br/>
happily cried, "It's elementary, my dear Woodson!" This favorite phrase<br/>
of his was also to become a part of Sherlockian lore. Desiring to check<br/>
on the progress of his railroad bridges, we walked to the right of the<br/>
Castle, under his new archway and onto the tracks. His "Grand Central<br/>
Station" was still under construction, but we followed the main tracks<br/>
over a footbridge and then north and down closer to the river. He<br/>
showed me an area of ledge with old mortared walls and a defunct<br/>
bridge, and then cut left down to the trail. We walked southwards a<br/>
short way to a bench over the river at an intersection, and I sat while<br/>
William paced back and forth. There were two small arched stone bridges<br/>
along the trail which led to another closed, wooden bridge. Just at the<br/>
southeast abutment of the western arched bridge, William's deerslayer<br/>
cap got lodged in the low stone wall. He was so busily pacing that I<br/>
forgot to mention it to him, and it is probably there to this day.<br/>
<br/>
But that calabash pipe and that deerslayer hat were one day to become<br/>
synonymous with Sherlock Holmes, as William's incorporation of them<br/>
into Sherlock's persona became well known. <br/>
