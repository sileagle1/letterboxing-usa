Nasco.<br/>

<br/>
I don't know if it is the same thing, but I would presume it is.  I've<br/>
used the pink stuff and also small blocks of mastercarve.  I've found<br/>
the mastercarve to be less firm. I carved a trail stamp for my brother<br/>
from Mastercarve and it fell a apart within a few months.  The pink<br/>
stuff was more expensive and I've never used Speedy Cut.<br/>
<br/>
I've found this page helpful to understand the difference in carving<br/>
media.<br/>
http://www.ruthannzaroff.com/carving/how-to3.htm<br/>
<br/>
I happened to get lucky one day a few years ago while at the Nasco<br/>
warehouse sale and was able to pick up a whole box of at least 36 4x6<br/>
pieces of softoleum for only $5.  At the time I was very new to<br/>
letterboxing and just had no concept as to what a great deal that was<br/>
and only bought one box, but they had a whole pallet of boxes and I'm<br/>
kicking myself now for not picking up more.<br/>
<br/>
We have 18 boxes planted and all but 3 of them were carved with<br/>
softoleum and I'm not aware of any problems with any of them yet.  I<br/>
think Softoleum is a tad bit more porous, but it carves easily and takes<br/>
the ink well.  I have even stopped mounting my stamps.  I think<br/>
unmounted stamps make a better image the 1st time, and the thickness of<br/>
the softoleum allows for that.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts....<br/>

it was too soft and I have ruined several pieces ....<br/>
this is me being a novice too, I know. then I ordered<br/>
some orange PZ Kut grade A.  I LOVE IT.  it is<br/>
thinner, but it is so easy to cut  (I did buy the<br/>
cutter too. use the #1 for just about everything) I<br/>
have since seen a couple PZ's in lb's and they are not<br/>
backed and look and work great. I am backing mine with<br/>
thin wood, but not sure it's necessary. anyway, I'd<br/>
recommend trying it. I haven't made any mistakes or<br/>
had pieces fall apart with it.  just my 2 cents. <br/>

If you back your PZKut with thin wood the wood will warp if (and when )<br/>
it gets wet.<br/>
And they always warp the wrong way (cup) making it hard to use the<br/>
stamp.<br/>
Just my 2 cents......<br/>
I have been leaving the backing off ,or use a 1/4 " thick foam rubber.<br/>
