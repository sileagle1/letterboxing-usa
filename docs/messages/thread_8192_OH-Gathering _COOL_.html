                    <div class="plaintext-content"> Wow it was such a nice day, Boy did we luck out.<br/>
<br/>
 After only getting to plant 3 boxes because of the Monsoon we had on Friday and the fact that they were talking about rain on Saturday, It turned out<br/>
perfect!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
 Clear Blue Skys a bit nippy at first but warmed up nice. We had a very nice turn out that lasted about 6 hours with a few adding on time as they were off to another park to look for more boxes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 For the First Gathering I would say you could not have asked for a better time.  It makes me feel good that another Gathering next year will be<br/>
very very  possible.<br/>
<br/>
 The only thing that went wrong for me was my Battery Died in my Camera so I did not get any pictures of the party, SO i would be so happy if someone E-Mailed me a few pictures so I can post them on my Web-Site.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks Everyone for coming and look forward to next year!  :O)<br/>

weather played nice.  Hoping someone has pictures, I would love to <br/>
see them.<br/>
<br/>
Also, are there pictures posted anywhere of last weekend's East Coast <br/>
gathering?  I really enjoyed the pictures of the August event on <br/>
Chuck's site and those from Oregon posted in the files area of this <br/>
list.  It helps make a connection, putting a face to to name, <br/>
especially when I was out east a few weeks ago and got a chance to <br/>
see log books that had accumulated a lot of stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
