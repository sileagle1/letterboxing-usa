<br/>
I hate paying a ton of money for small stamp pads to place in my <br/>
letterboxes (trying to pay rent, student loans, and save $$ for a <br/>
house).  I have bought a few of the cat eye pads and the Gem brand 1" <br/>
square pads for $2.00 each in the past, but this weekend I got some <br/>
great deals.<br/>
<br/>
I went to my local Michael's (Attleboro, MA) and checked out the <br/>
Clearance section.  They had about 20 1" stamp pads made by <br/>
Inkadinkadoo.  There weren't many colors (green, purple, dark blue, <br/>
and greenish blue), but for 35 cents each I bought them all!  If you <br/>
have a Michael's near you, it may be worth the trip to check their <br/>
clearance section.<br/>
<br/>
I also went to JoAnne Fabrics to get some camoflauge fabric to wrap <br/>
some letterboxes in ($1.00/yard) and checked on their stamp pads.  <br/>
They have sets of 12 1" stamp pads made by Rubber Stampede for <br/>
$9.99.  Less than $1.00 a stamp pad and they come in a ton of <br/>
colors!  I bought the classic colors but they had others too.  I <br/>
think one was called Romance Colors and had a lot of pastels.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would share this info with my fellow letterboxers!  <br/>
Hope it helps!<br/>

Could someone who has used these tell me how the quality is.  Are they<br/>
worth buying? <br/>

Probably 90% of the letterboxes that I've found don't have stamp pads in <br/>
them. Then again, I haven't found any in CT yet, so I don't know what the <br/>
convention is up there (or in other places in the US that I haven't yet <br/>
visited)!<br/>
