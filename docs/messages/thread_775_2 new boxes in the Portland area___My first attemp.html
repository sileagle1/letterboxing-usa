&gt; Here are the clues...since I haven't scanned the images yet, perhaps<br/>
I'll<br/>
&gt; send them to Mitch soon to be added, along twith the clues.  These<br/>
are the<br/>
&gt; first clues that I've written, and are not all all poetic or epic,<br/>
but I<br/>
&gt; think they'll do the trick!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; First two in the Oxbow Series:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Take I-84 east to Troutdale exit 17.  Go past the truck stops until<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; light.  Turn right onto 257th and go 3.5 miles to Division St.  Turn<br/>
left<br/>
&gt; onto Division.  Follow the signs for 8 miles and then turn left,<br/>
downhill<br/>
&gt; into the park.  Entrance fee is $3.00 per vehicle, and there are maps<br/>
of the<br/>
&gt; parks available there.  Happy Hunting!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; #1 Find the Ampitheatre and take the trail to the left of it, towards<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; river.  Head down the wooden steps. Now, proceed ahead with a bearing<br/>
of 320<br/>
&gt; degrees.  Turn right at the trail closest to the river.  When you find<br/>
&gt; yourself betwixt the M&amp;M, head 9 paces (or slightly less if you are<br/>
way<br/>
&gt; taller than 5') at 170 degrees. Now you should be directly in front<br/>
of your<br/>
&gt; prize!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; #2 Take the D trail, to the right of the road. Head to the right, and<br/>
stay<br/>
&gt; to the right past the Woody Woodpecker home, and past the hollow<br/>
tree.  At<br/>
&gt; the longest downed tree on the left, there is a sharp turn in the<br/>
trail,<br/>
&gt; with a wood and rope railing.  If you suddenly find yourself able to <br/>
sit<br/>
&gt; down to a picnic, you've gone astray, instead, you should have leaned<br/>
to the<br/>
&gt; left (it's the only way!). Now, there is a post in the ground near<br/>
the turn<br/>
&gt; in the trail, from there head forward 19 paces. Look all around you<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; enjoy the greenery, but what you seek is at 180 degrees...It may be<br/>
easier<br/>
&gt; to find me if you can get down on your knees.   <br/>
