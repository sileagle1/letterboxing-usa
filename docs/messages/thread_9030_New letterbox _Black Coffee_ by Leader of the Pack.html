Black Coffee<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Planted 10/28/02<br/>
Planted By: Leader of the Pack - en route to Louisville, Ky. for the<br/>
National FFA Convention.<br/>
<br/>
Rated Drive - up : literally needed to pull over to stretch legs and<br/>
wake mind! Have Fun.<br/>
<br/>
Connecticut to Kentucky is a long but beautiful drive. We were fortunate<br/>
to make it at the peak of fall color and enjoyed the trip. We knew we<br/>
would make many rest stops and coffee breaks thus the Black Coffee<br/>
letterbox. After a 3:30 a.m. start time we were in serious need of a<br/>
break as we drove along Rte 70 west and saw the sign welcoming us to<br/>
Wheeling, West Virginia. This piece of West Virginia is just a quick<br/>
pass through on the highway west. You will want to stop at the welcome<br/>
center / rest stop after crossing into the state.<br/>
