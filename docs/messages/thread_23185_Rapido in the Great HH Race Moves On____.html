                    <div class="plaintext-content">Having traveled from Fairfax VA to Destin FL on the word that Rapido <br/>
had landed in a LB in the Henderson Park Series, I was sorry to see I <br/>
had missed him.  The "P" family from Sterling Heights MI (I don't want <br/>
to post the family surname on line) had logged in after Rapido took <br/>
shelter and may have retrieved him on Feb 22.  But I hadn't received <br/>
any email update to that effect.<br/>
<br/>
I admit I am not timely on posting HH's I have moved along . . . but <br/>
this one was in a RACE!!  If this family happens to catch this post, <br/>
please email me off list  (sowbiz @ yahoo . com)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
