<div>KJ'S  Best is located inside Kathy John's 
Ice Cream Shop, junction of Rte 44&amp;195 in Storrs. Right on the UCONN 
campus.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Rated :Easy</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Time: how long does it take to eat ice 
cream?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also:  The best little rubber stamp shop 
going is just inside the door!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Arrive at kathy John's hungry for great ice 
cream and a usual line of lunches and suppers. Plan enough time to go through 
the millions of runbber stamps.  They are located at the junction of 
44&amp;195 in Storrs behind the Texaco.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When you enter the shop keep to the right. 
Flags, candy, sumptuous cookies, decorations and nick-knacks are everywhere. 
When you are ready to seek the box remeber to do so discreetly as if you were 
shopping.  Be prepared to take it to a booth to sit down and stamp 
in.  I was attracted to  a great display of candy in old fashioned 
jars. Penny candy now a little more but just like grandpa used to buy it. Jars 
in a row. My eyes are distracted by displays of decorative flags for the home. 
So many designs they are stacked in boxes on the floor!  Pondewr which 
would look good at your house. As  you look through them you should comea 
across the reward you seek.  Stamp in and eplace well hidden in its spot 
for others an a quest. Through the calorie laden shop. Have fun most of all!
