                    <div class="plaintext-content">Knowing that my Hog riding, windsurfing pal, John Kerry, had left the Rosie Ruiz HH <br/>
in the Boss Hogg letterbox in Wankers Corners, OR, I spent hours and hours <br/>
deciphering that danged clue. I feared that the evil clue created by Baxter Alono, (who <br/>
IS this twisted person?!) was so baffling that a hitch hiker could languish there <br/>
forever. <br/>
<br/>
Always one to cheer for the underdog, I wanted to make sure that this hitcher stayed <br/>
in the race. I zipped out there and rescued her... She's soon to get a big boost in her <br/>
progress. I'll keep you posted. Funhog<br/>

Zipping the extra mile?<br/>

Real fast?  <br/>
Always better than last!<br/>
