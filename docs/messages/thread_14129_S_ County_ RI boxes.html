Just Bass, Narragansett - alive and well<br/>

ASA Pond, Peacedale - both boxes alive and well, but the log books <br/>
are nearly full.  Would you like me to replace the log books and send <br/>
the originals to the letterbox owners, or simply add another log book <br/>
to the box?<br/>
<br/>
Dolphins at Daybreak, Rome Point - alive and well<br/>
<br/>
That was just this week.  Will continue reporting as I scourge the <br/>
area.<br/>

I wish I coulda scrounged along.<br/>

Next time I have a day off, I'll call you ahead of time.<br/>

We enjoyed our stay at Fishermen's Memorial Park camping this weekend.  Too bad the boxes local to that are all but gone.  Point Jude is alive and well, you say?  Amazing.  Lone Mass Wolf and YIMS lost 2 near the gazebo, and one elswhere.  I'm glad that one is hanging in there.  Next time...<br/>
<br/>
I thought Rome Point had 2 boxes on it...?<br/>
