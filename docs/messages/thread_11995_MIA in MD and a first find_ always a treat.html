have absolutely no doubt that we were at the correct spot, but the <br/>
box was not there.  We were at the first tree on the left as <br/>
described and there was indeed an obvious pile of rocks there but no <br/>
box.  <br/>
<br/>
We did nab a first find on the Lake Frank Fungus!  I don't care how <br/>
many boxes you find, a first find is always a joy!  Sarah and I were <br/>
so anxious to get on the trail that we ran out of the office without <br/>
proper footwear and some crappy old foam Valentine's day stamps.  <br/>
The trail was beckoning so we made due but I recommend solid <br/>
footwear if you venture for this box.  The hike is not difficult or <br/>
particularly long but there is some rough footing involved.  Thanks <br/>
to Deb for the box and welcome to the game!  If you want to make <br/>
lifelong friends, hide some boxes in the Frederick area!  (hint, <br/>
hint, is anyone else reading this?)<br/>
<br/>
We also found the Lake Frank Turtle which was recently replaced by <br/>
the Forest Frog family.  Our apologies to Squirrel for sitting on <br/>
this replacement box so long and thanks to the Frogs for replacing <br/>
it for us.<br/>
<br/>
So if you haven't started boxing again yet, get your butts out <br/>
there!  I am sore and pretty pooped but I couldn't be happier about <br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
BOX ON!<br/>
