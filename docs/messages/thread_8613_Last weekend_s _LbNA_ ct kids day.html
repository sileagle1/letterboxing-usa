meeting so many of you at the CT Kids Day Gathering in<br/>
Rocky Neck Park.  It was a unique chance to meet face<br/>
to face with those whose letterboxes and notes I've<br/>
come across in the past year.  I've thoroughly enjoyed<br/>
this hobby and look forward to future hunts.  I am SO<br/>
impressed with the quality of clues and stamps around<br/>
here!  I really admire the creativity and talent that<br/>
went into them!  I can't wait for the next chance to<br/>
meet/gather/socialize/compare notes/share war stories<br/>
with you all!  If anyone wants to meet up for a hike,<br/>
just say the word...my bag is packed and the "FALL<br/>
orange fashions" are in the car.<br/>
Peace!  Happy trails!  <br/>

&gt; To all you letter boxers that came to Kids Day today<br/>
&gt;  I really want to <br/>
&gt; thank all of you .!  It was great fun and Alan made<br/>
&gt; our most wonderful <br/>
&gt; Event Stamp once again. Thanks Alan, and he gifted<br/>
&gt; the stamp to me. !! I <br/>
&gt; have  the one he made for us last year too. and now<br/>
&gt; have this great idea <br/>
&gt; brewing, Stay Tuned.!<br/>
&gt; The most fun I had today, was riding around on my<br/>
&gt; bike to make sure no <br/>
&gt; one got lost , or needed help, and I kept seeing<br/>
&gt; people walking with the <br/>
&gt; orange sheets tight in their hands and big grins on<br/>
&gt; their faces.  Joy <br/>
&gt; everywhere .<br/>
&gt; Congrates to those who made 100 today at kids day.<br/>
&gt; What could be better <br/>
&gt; than that ?<br/>
&gt; This wonderful day would never have happened without<br/>
&gt; all  the enjoyable <br/>
&gt; effort  put forth by Bluebird., Alfair , Lobsta ,The<br/>
&gt; Gal Pals, and <br/>
&gt; Angel.  We all had a blast . Thanks for coming.<br/>
&gt; Happy boxing.<br/>
