<div><span class="064315400-24032003">We're just back from 
a long-awaited trip home to New Zealand, where we managed to place a couple of 
boxes, in between catching up with friends and relatives. The first box, "the 
Happy Humpback", is in Tauranga, in a beautiful virgin forest, not far from 
where some of the LoTR scenes were shot (yes I know - whales don't live in 
forests...). </span></div>
<div><span class="064315400-24032003"></span><span class="064315400-24032003">The clues are at</span></div>
<div><span class="064315400-24032003"><a href="http://www.psychokiwi.org/letterboxing/happyhumpback.htm">www.psychokiwi.org/letterboxing/happyhumpback.htm</a></span></div>
<div><span class="064315400-24032003">I have not included 
all the clues here because they include a couple of photos.</span></div>
<div><span class="064315400-24032003"></span> </div>
<div><span class="064315400-24032003">Clues to the second 
box (in collaboration with the Leader of the Pack) will be posted soon. Our 
third NZ box - the Dancing Dolphin - was left with the extended members of Team 
Psychokiwi to place somewhere in the Wellington region.</span></div>
<div><span class="064315400-24032003"></span> </div>
<div><span class="064315400-24032003">We also tried to 
place our Kuddly Koala letterbox in Australia, but could not find a good spot in 
the limited time we had. I think there is a reason there are no boxes in Oz - 8 
of the 10 most deadliest snakes live there! And they love little nooks under 
rocks too! So the Kuddly Koala letterbox was left with relatives in the hope 
that they'll find somewhere safe to place it.</span></div>
<div><span class="064315400-24032003"></span> </div>
<div><span class="064315400-24032003">I hope some of you 
get the chance to go boxing Down Under too - the hiking and scenery is 
definitely worth the 30+ hours traveling to get there! It looks like there are 
now 5 boxes to find (and I hear rumors that one of the great letterboxers 
of all time is planning a trip, so hopefully there will be even more to 
find very soon) There are, however, lots of geo-caches to find (we 
sought out a couple - and left pamphlets on letterboxing in them 
:-))</span></div>
<div><span class="064315400-24032003"></span> </div>
<div><span class="064315400-24032003">It's wonderful to be 
back though in the beautiful springtime, having missed the last two storms of 
winter. Now to find all those boxes that have been hiding under the 
snow!</span></div>
<div><span class="064315400-24032003"></span> </div>
<div><span class="064315400-24032003">Cheers,</span></div>
