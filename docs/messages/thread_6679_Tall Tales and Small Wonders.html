                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">First of all, thanks to Carolyn and Heidi for another wonderful <br/>
Mansfield area letterboxing event, and to Chuck and Barbara for the <br/>
great photos! We've also been enjoying all the recent "wandaandpete <br/>
stories",guys! Just wanted to repeat for the newcomers, though, that <br/>
we really did not start out trying to get to boxes quickly in order <br/>
to BE FIRST, but rather in an attempt to stem that former wave <br/>
of "I'm first"/"1st Again!" type writings that used to appear in the <br/>
logbooks! We thought that if we just got to enough boxes to set a <br/>
good example by never writing about being first or beating someone <br/>
that eventually people would notice and the tide would gracefully <br/>
turn. We're so glad to see for the most part that has now happened!<br/>
<br/>
Also, just to set the record straight (and for those folks who really <br/>
want to "beat wandaandpete"! :-) - there are actually LOADS of places <br/>
we haven't been to yet for letterboxing - like basically EVERYWHERE <br/>
between eastern PA and western WA! We had, in fact, been planning to <br/>
hit some of that heartland area this month on our way west to do our <br/>
annual summer volunteer trailbuilding work on the Continental Divide, <br/>
but now it seems that circumstances have once again conspired to deny <br/>
us that opportunity, so we'll just have to hope for next year!<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the new boxes that continue to pop up closer to home are <br/>
still keeping us hopping, plus we still haven't even had the time to <br/>
make it out to places like Cape Cod and Mt. Holyoke that are scarcely <br/>
2 hours drive away! So please be patient with us,folks - we really <br/>
have been trying to restrain ourselves from the nearer boxes and get <br/>
out to the further boxes, but sometimes it's just too hard! Also, <br/>
please understand that, try as I may to write mostly nice things,I am <br/>
still only human and bound to get tripped up once in a while, <br/>
especially with all the strange shoes I've had to wear over the years!<br/>
<br/>
As for purple socks, I wear them whenever I can, but am still more <br/>
likely to wear red ones. In fact, one of the as yet unpublished <br/>
Valley Quests that I helped to place in Vermont last year contains <br/>
precisely that - my carved rendering of an old red sock! So please be <br/>
on the lookout for that whenever Steve can get property permission <br/>
and his George Knox clues out!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, that 100 boxes in one day may still be a bit of a "Paul <br/>
Bunyon story", but it's beginning to look more and more likely that <br/>
it could soon be possible for someone! For example, with no prior <br/>
planning other than attending the gathering last Saturday afternoon, <br/>
and having already gotten most of the drive-bys and quickies aimed at <br/>
kids and families  on a dozen previous trips to the Mansfield area, <br/>
Pete was still able to find 36 boxes in about 6 hours - half of them <br/>
after 5 PM! I'd already found some of them earlier, so my personal <br/>
record will probably always remain at the 27 I got one day last <br/>
August, but anyone willing to do a bit of pre-planning  and who <br/>
hasn't already heavily hit the area previously could now very <br/>
possibly get 50 boxes or more in a single day! So how about it,Jay? <br/>
Wouldn't this just be the perfect way to finally get your F count up <br/>
higher than that phenomenal P count of yours? We'll even help plan <br/>
your letterboxing "triptik"! This strategy could also be a big boost <br/>
for anyone new interested in joining the PFX 500 Club, and we know <br/>
quite a few of you are getting close, so we hope you all continue to <br/>
have lots of fun with this great little hobby of ours!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>

I'll gladly take you up on that, but only if we can go together <br/>
(honestly, Wanda, I'll TRY to keep up!).<br/>

(For those who don't know, before she discovered letterboxing, Wanda <br/>
held the Guiness record for most solo miles hiked by a woman, <br/>
including multiple Appalacian Trail through hikes, the PCT and the <br/>
CDT. Wow! I've had the pleasure of hiking with her and Pete, and boy <br/>
can she motor!)<br/>

<br/>
No kidding!  Our family was the first to stamp in at a box here in VA <br/>
and it was the first box we found as well as the first box placed by <br/>
the people who own it.  We were pretty excited. With everything going <br/>
on in the world these days is it really necessary to be so petty as <br/>
to care who gets excited about being the first to stamp in AND go out <br/>
and try to prevent it?  <br/>
....Please....<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; we really did not start out trying to get to boxes quickly in <br/>
order <br/>
&gt; &gt; to BE FIRST, but rather in an attempt to stem that former wave <br/>
&gt; &gt; of "I'm first"/"1st Again!" type writings that used to appear in <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; logbooks! We thought that if we just got to enough boxes to set a <br/>
&gt; &gt; good example by never writing about being first or beating <br/>
someone <br/>
&gt; &gt; that eventually people would notice and the tide would gracefully <br/>
&gt; &gt; turn. We're so glad to see for the most part that has now <br/>
happened!<br/>

I hope you get as much action on your new boxes as the ones in Red <br/>
Wing.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I think that was my box, wasn't it? I don't mind if<br/>
&gt; you write you were first--someone's gotta be<br/>
&gt; first--and you won the prize for being it! (big prize,<br/>
&gt; huh? lol) Nothing wrong with that at all.  In fact, I<br/>
&gt; did the "Someone-found-my-box!" dance when I saw that<br/>
&gt; you had stamped in.  I don't think that's illegal<br/>
&gt; (funny to watch my little jig) but not demanding<br/>
&gt; intervening action from someone who thinks they<br/>
&gt; apparently behave better than anyone who comes before<br/>
&gt; them??  Oh geesh!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually, I think those boxes were the first box found<br/>
&gt; by quite a few people, too bad they went missing.<br/>

&gt; Got some new ones in the works, ya'll come to PA,<br/>
