What a perfect treat for a rainy day.  Having had to delay our search for <br/>
the Scooby boxes and having broken a nail bowling with the kids...  BeMa was <br/>
in need of some fun.  So, off we went to the library in search of a <br/>
letterbox book!  What a cool concept (and a nice library).  It was hard <br/>
keeping the Ma part of BeMa library quiet.  At one point she saw a platform <br/>
that looked like a stage....<br/>
<br/>
We found the right spot for the box but it was gone!  Daddy and Be sat down <br/>
bummed but Mommy and Ma went on a spying expedition!  We found the boxers <br/>
logging in the box.  We were too shy to say hello and when we looked in the <br/>
book later we saw stamps but no name!  Oh well!  Serves us right for not <br/>
stepping up and introducing ourselves (and getting our first X -- second <br/>
missed opportunity for that).  We saw Mary's stamp "daughter of the old <br/>
dominion" who we email to but have not yet met.  I didn't realize you were <br/>
there this morning.  We missed you too!  Anyway, we were trying so hard to <br/>
be secretive (and distract Be away from all the Pokemon magazines -- our tax <br/>
dollars at work...) that we might have forgotten to write our names too!<br/>
<br/>
The box is very ingenious and we really enjoyed be able to keep boxing on <br/>
such a gloomy day -- Thanks!<br/>

<p>That was probably us logging to the box.  It was a great day for a library visit.  And I agree a great box.</p>
