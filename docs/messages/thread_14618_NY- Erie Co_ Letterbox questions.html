My family and I are heading out to Snyder over the weekend for a family reunion (Dearborn Heights, MI to Snyder, NY- ROAD TRIP!!!!).  <br/>
Despite the OODLES of fun a family reunion promises (*grin*) I probably have one day I'll be able to get away to letterbox, so I was wondering if anyone could give me a heads up?  Any boxes I should avoid, which ones are easiest (I will have a one year old in tow, so easy is good *grin*), which ones might be MIA?<br/>
Here's my list:<br/>
Buffalo Wings<br/>
Sinking Ponds<br/>
Chestnut Ridge<br/>
Eternal Flame<br/>
MoNY 1- Cemetery Dog<br/>
MoNY 5- Phantom Cat<br/>
In Search of Charles Burchfield<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be great!  I'm hoping to hit as many as possible in a shockingly short window of time.  I was thinking about starting out at the Buffalo Wings box, since that's only 8 miles from my aunt and uncle's house.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much!<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Delirium<br/>

out "Mentor Headlands Beach" and "Peeper Hollow".  They're not too <br/>
far off I-90 and don't involve lengthly hikes.  Both were in place a <br/>
week ago.  I believe there are some others on the west side of <br/>
Cleveland as well but I haven't gotten to them yet so can't tell you <br/>
much about them.  Have a good trip!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Delerium, I am the owner of five of these and have found the <br/>
other two.  As far as I know they are all still there, though I <br/>
found Sinking Ponds about a year ago.  They are all fairly easy, <br/>
short hikes.  <br/>
<br/>
Easiest and shortest would be:<br/>
Buffalo Wings, if you park in the right place<br/>
Charles Burchfield<br/>
Chestnut Ridge (at least going down the steps)<br/>
<br/>
After that, the others are a little longer walks but mostly level or <br/>
with minimal slopes.  Eternal Flame may be the longest and most <br/>
challenging, probably still less than a mile but with a decent hill <br/>
or two, but worth the hike to see the flaming waterfall.<br/>
<br/>
Email me off list if you want more details: jelybean@stny.rr.com<br/>
