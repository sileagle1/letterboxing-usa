&gt;Subject: [LbNA] Two Boxes in Shirley, Mass<br/>
&gt;Date: Sun, 22 Aug 1999 20:16:40 -0700<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Letterboxers all -<br/>
&gt;Who was it that said, you can't go home again... Well, at least as far<br/>
&gt;as letterboxing goes, thats incorrect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After a summer of thinking about it, I've finally placed two boxes in my<br/>
&gt;home town of Shirley Center, MA. It was very satisfying to remember<br/>
&gt;scraps of images from my childhood, and bring them back as stamp images.<br/>
&gt;Hopefully, I'll be able to do more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The stamps are Susan's - she just sits down and carves, with little<br/>
&gt;fuss.  Perhaps I think about it too much..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks Tom for putting them up on the web page - it looks geat.  O yea,<br/>
&gt;check out my covered bridge (its real!).<br/>

Poetry memorization is still alive and well in Vermont, Deborah. My <br/>
elementary school students memorize poetry, as do I. My son Peter <br/>
just memorized The Highwayman and The Raven last year in 8th grade. I <br/>
memorized A Child's Christmas in Wales last fall for our Christmas <br/>
Day celebrations. It feeds the mind and soul!<br/>

Stephen Maturin knew the entire Iliad (in the original, of course.)<br/>

<br/>
That's great, Tom! I always liked doing that ....<br/>
My older daughters had a 4th grade teacher that had them <br/>
memorize poetry, and that was it .... They still -read- poetry<br/>
in school, and perform... but not from memory. Their summer<br/>
has been full of memorization, though ... through the Young<br/>
Shakespeare Players which performed Cymbeline last week...<br/>
veeerry inspiring, though I only picked up a few lines here and<br/>
there while helping them. When I had piano lessons as a girl<br/>
we HAD to have recital pieces memorized, no music on the<br/>
stand. Now it's strictly optional.<br/>
(The Iliad? Really?)<br/>
