&gt; Switching gears.  One of the messages I was reading this morning showed some hesitation over stamp carving, especially with all the talent around here.  Please don't be!  Try your hand, discover if you like it.  Everyone had a first time.  Don't just stop with one that you think is "baby carving" - practice improves all art forms!   Heh, its not my strong point either, but, that shouldn't stop me.  Sometimes though, a store bought solves a particular.  I'm currently looking for a beer mug.  I've got a pizza box (one of those triangle tupperware ones to save a slice) and want to plant a beer and pizza.  Will need a big area to place that one.<br/>

OK, I made my stamp before we ever went letterboxing, because I wanted<br/>
to add the crafty element of stamp carving to the experience.<br/>
<br/>
That said, had I not made my own, I would have probably used a<br/>
store-bought stamp, one I'm considering using if I ever damage my<br/>
hand-carved.<br/>
<br/>
It's not that I can't make my own stamp. It's that the one I have is<br/>
so "me." It's a bass clarinet (I play bass clarinet). Bass clarinet<br/>
*anything* is rare enough, but a stamp is just so cool-- people<br/>
finding my stamp would know it was almost certainly me. And I keep<br/>
thinking "Well, maybe you should just make a new bass clarinet stamp"<br/>
and then I laugh and laugh and laugh. My hand-carved stamp is 2 inches<br/>
wide and has 8 thick, crude letters and six symbols. A bass<br/>
clarinet.... is waaay more complex.<br/>
<br/>
So, who else uses a store-bought stamp because the design is exactly<br/>
something "you" and something you could never carve yourself?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For almost 3 years, Sue &amp; I used a store-bought pinecone stamp. The last year, we started using 2 colors of markers to enhance it's looks but it was pretty intricate at that and we continued to recieve compliments on it - until we retired it a few months ago when Phyto graciously offered to carve a new one for us. <br/>
<br/>
Since then 16 others from around the country have sent some pinecones our way thanks to a little left coast piggy!  :-) <br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

Me!<br/>

My sig stamp is of a petite dark haired woman wearing chain mail, <br/>
armor, and carrying a big-assed sword.  I use cranberry red pigment <br/>
ink to stamp in.<br/>

I do.  I hadn't even picked my trail name until I saw "my" stamp <br/>
online.  It was perfect for me &amp; there was no way I could have carved <br/>
something even close enough at the time.  (When my Mom saw what I had <br/>
chosen, she agreed that this was the perfect stamp for me.)  Also, I <br/>
just wanted to GET STARTED!  When Bunny Boy is older &amp; wants a stamp <br/>
of his own, I am planning on carving my own personal stamp.  But <br/>
until then, this one works for us.  <br/>

My signature stamp suites me. And I love it.<br/>
