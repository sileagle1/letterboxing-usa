<p>At Lake Crabtree County Park on Aviation Parkway off I-40 near the RDU International Airport, you will find a great park for walking, boat rentals, and picknicking.  Check out the boardwalk, and walk around to see the lake views from the observation tower, the gazebo, and the boat ramp overlook.  In season, rent a rowboat, canoe or sailboat.  This is a great park for a sunset picnic on the lakefront, and for watching planes landing as well as seeing wildlife.  </p>
<p>To find the letterbox, park in the gravel lot that is the first right as you come into the park.  Hike the Old Beech Nature Trail.  At this time, there is a great deal of ice storm damage to the pine trees at the first part of the trail.  You will find a park sign describing the Loblolly pine.  From this sign, take 70 medium paces to a Beech tree on your left.  To the left of the trail there is a fallen, decaying tree just ahead of you.  You will find the letterbox under the fallen tree, wrapped in felt, and covered with pieces of bark.  PLEASE make sure to thoroughly hide the box when you are done, checking to make sure it is hidden from view from BOTH sides of the trail.  ENJOY!  </p>
