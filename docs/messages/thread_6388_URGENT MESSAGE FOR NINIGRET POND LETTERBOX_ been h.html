                    <html><body>Darrin and I went searching for the Ninigret Pond Letterbox near the Charlestown Breachway in RI.  We found the letterbox, but it was in a HUGE outcropping of poison ivy and pricker bushes.  We were able to get the box out, but had to hide it in a slightly different place.  THE LETTERBOX IS STILL UNDERNEATH THE SQUARE LANDING BUT UNDERNEATH THE NORTHWEST CORNER BY THE CEMENT FOOTING, not the northeast corner as the directions say.  Also, the letterbox needs a new container since the last one is cracked.  The letterbox was soaking wet inside and out.  We attempted to air it out as much as we could, but the stamp, stamp pad, and sign in book were still quite damp.  It also needs a new pen.  If I had a regular pen with me (I only had a fancy pen given to me by one of my students at school), I would have replaced it.
<br/>
<br/>Don't know yet I have poison ivy yet :-)  I hope not!  I apologize if this is not good letterboxing etiquette (to move a box) but it was practically impossible to get in its current state.  We were only able to get it since we used a stick to move away many of the plants, and I still had to put my hand through an outcropping of poison ivy to get it!  Darrin thought I was nuts!  I said that if I was walking 3 miles one way on beach sand to get this letterbox, then I was going to go through with it!
