I believe that the horse itself is not the issue.  <br/>
<br/>
Rather, the action of beating a dead horse demonstrate a lack of <br/>
intelligence of the one engaged in the beating. ie: individual is an <br/>
idiot; as of course, no matter how much you beat a dead animal, it <br/>
is not going to get up and continue to take you on your way.<br/>
