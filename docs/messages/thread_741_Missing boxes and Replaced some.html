I went up there about a month after it was placed, the<br/>
sign was up.  It must have been taken at that point.<br/>
I am sure, Steven will have a new one created and<br/>
placed soon.  <br/>
Mitch and everyone:<br/>
This weekend I also replaced and moved letterboxes. <br/>
One of mine on the Green Isle path is gone.  Someone<br/>
Took it!  I'm worried that this person might take some<br/>
more.  Hopefully not!  <br/>
I have replaced letter D: at the lone tree on the<br/>
path, walk towards the food/lodging sign and there<br/>
before the high way, is the box.  good hunting.<br/>
Letter F: once on the trail after finding the first<br/>
box, continue following until first rest area.  Behind<br/>
the bench in the thicket it is placed.  Good luck.<br/>
I'll let everyone know when letter g is placed.  <br/>
New box placed, Cabot Point Box.  Follow Steve's<br/>
directions to Sherwood Point.  Instead of stopping at<br/>
bar, continue forward til you have to go left or<br/>
right.  Turn left and follow til park area near<br/>
water's edge.  Walk upon the rocks going right until<br/>
you spy a tree laying on the rocks.  There is also<br/>
some black and brown/burgendy rocks around.  In<br/>
amongst them is the box.  Enjoy the sites.<br/>
love you.  die xo<br/>
