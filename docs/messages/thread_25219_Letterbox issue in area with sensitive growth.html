                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello, I've been quite a fan of letter-boxing, but I'm not too familiar with the inner workings of it at the moment. <br/>
<br/>
I'm working with a lady who is an environmentalist that works with the local parts and conservancies.  They were noticing an unusual trample of vegetation in one of their more highly sensitive locations and were unable to locate the problem until a month ago. She found the letterbox and took it home with her to figure out what it was. I was able to use letterboxing.org to determine it was "Duff Celebration Box"   LbNA #: 17028.  The letterbox was hidden in 2005 which explained the mystery of trampled sensitive vegetation. <br/>
<br/>
She wishes to get the letterbox moved to a slightly different part of the park or removed from the website altogether. If it will stay, it will need some adjustments. The park does have a policy in which prohibits letterboxes and geocaches being placed without park permission. I'm assuming that this letterbox might predate those rules but I'm not sure. There was no record of it with the park. <br/>
<br/>
Two weeks ago, I attempted to contact the owners of the letterbox via the email they listed and via the contact feature. I didn't hear back from them and the email they listed was returning error messages. I did however send an email to the webmasters a few days ago about this but have yet to hear back. <br/>
<br/>
What is the best course of action? The park would greatly appreciate the listing being disabled or changed as soon as possible, to prevent people from going to look for a letterbox which is no longer there. <br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping that perhaps, since the owners remain unable to be contacted, that someone else in the Pittsburgh area could adopt it or recycling the letterbox into a new one. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If the person who placed this letterbox isn't responding to you and doesn't respond after this post - your best course of action is to contact the webmasters through www.letterboxing.org, which you have already done - I'm sure they will respond to your mail as I know them to be monitoring the site.  If you don't get an answer within a week, I would try contacting them again.  They are the only ones who can remove the clue besides the person who posted it in the first place.  I'm not even positive they can remove it, but they will tell you whether they can or can't and what to do if they can't.  Sorry this box has had the outcome you describe - we all try to avoid that sort of thing.  Please don't think all letterboxers are insensitive to this issue.  I'm sure the webmasters at LBNA will help you out.<br/>
