<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I’ve been working on a letterbox project for the past few months. Instead of 
static boxes placed in a hidden location, the boxes are carried by people. The 
clues lead to the identity of the "human letterboxes". The next step is for the 
seekers to locate the people who have the boxes in their possession. The game is 
going to be played at the <a href="http://www.folkfest.org/">Philadelphia Folk 
Festival </a>which is scheduled to take place on Aug 24 thru the 26. This is a 
gated event, and admission prices vary. I will post the clues at various places 
in the camp grounds and festival grounds, and invite folks to look for the five 
people at the festival who are carrying the stamps. My Human Letterboxes will be 
carrying a stamp, stamp pad, and a few of the clue sheets (to pass out to 
curious onlookers). The clue sheets will have the clues, space for the stamp 
impressions and an explanation of letterboxing. I will carry a log book with my 
letterbox to record the visitors. I haven’t decided yet about whether the 
seekers must find all of the other Human Letterboxes first in order to log into 
the book and get the last stamp. At the end of the festival, the Human 
Letterboxes will keep the stamps as my gift for their participation in the game. 
I will hide my stamp in a public park near the festival grounds to commemorate 
the game we played there this summer. Of course I will post the clue here, on 
the listserv for you all to enjoy.</p>
<p>I’m pretty excited about the project, and I hope it goes well. Do you guys 
have any suggestions or questions? This might help me think of things I may have 
forgotten or point out ways for the game to go more smoothly.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

Hi Space Traveller<br/>
<br/>
Long time no hear from !<br/>
<br/>
I like the human boxes !<br/>
<br/>
They are in effect the UK travellers !<br/>
<br/>
A great idea at an event  I hope it works well !<br/>
<br/>
You could have bonus stamps carried alongside your travellers if certain<br/>
"correct questions" are asked..or some link betwen the stamps or<br/>
travellers is identified...eg all have a red hat on (too easy) or say<br/>
there are notes (musical) on the stamps which in sequence are the opening<br/>
of a well known song .. The first to guess it (sing it) wins a special<br/>
prize even ! (tough!) <g> !<br/>
