Charlestown, RI, after a frenzied and chaotic day of stamping, stamping<br/>
and more stamping!  Now with a little time to take stock I find that I<br/>
managed to track down 16 letterboxes, including four travellers and one<br/>
hitchhiker.  I exchanged 32 or 33 stamps, depending upon whether Spirit<br/>
Kitty counts*.  And I snagged one event stamp and one, um, game stamp<br/>
(for lack of a better category).<br/>
<br/>
It was great to be able to put so many faces to so many stamps.  Despite<br/>
the lousy weather during the first half of the day there was never a lack<br/>
of new people to meet.  I'd like to extend a huge thank you to Trish for<br/>
organizing -- I had a fine time and you did a fantastic job!<br/>
<br/>
Now back to my ordinary, hum-drum life.  ;-)<br/>

*If Spirit Kitty is imaginary, as I gathered s/he is, does he/she count<br/>
as an exchange?  I counted Max, and he's a dog, AND I didn't even get to<br/>
actually meet him.  But if I count Spirit Kitty, I should probably then<br/>
count Betz's Batik, which is a car and not even sentient.  How many times<br/>
can you split a hair, anyway?  Well, best to err on the side of<br/>
inclusion, I suppose.  p2 f78 x37 e2.<br/>

Betz and I came after the rain (about 3pm?).  Although we did get to meet<br/>
some people, we didn't stick around the home base much.  We did some boxes<br/>
in the immediate area and then went out for coffee and salad in Westerly.<br/>
(We both opted out on the potluck dinner. It sure smelled yummy, though!)<br/>
We got back just as everyone was leaving the pavilion.  We helped CSCM find<br/>
the Hershey kisses <s> and them headed to the campsite, but decided to call<br/>
it a day instead.  And what a good day it was.<br/>
<br/>
I regret not being able to meet Wanda and Pete or Jay Drew, three people I<br/>
was really looking forward to meeting in person.  Sorry I missed you.<br/>
