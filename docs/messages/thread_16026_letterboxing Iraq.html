Curiosity makes me ask, "Whether what's appropriate?"  Sending a care<br/>
package?  Or planting a box in a hidden location on a military base in a war<br/>
zone?<br/>
<br/>
A place, I might add, where most have a very low sense of humor normally,<br/>
let alone adding the fact that it's a war zone.  (Grin)<br/>
