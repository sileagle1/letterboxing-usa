NOTE: You will also want to bring the clues for the Hobbs Hill <br/>
Letterbox, part<br/>
of the Moose Hill series by Lonemasswolf as you can easy pick up the <br/>
trail to<br/>
that box from this one. There are also other boxes placed at Moose <br/>
Hill that<br/>
you might like to try. Check under Massachusetts, Norfolk County, <br/>
Sharon.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
Across the street from the Nature Center is the old dirt parking lot. <br/>
Pick up<br/>
the Trillium Trail here at the western end of the old lot. Continue <br/>
to the T<br/>
intersection with the Kettle Trail. Here, follow the sign pointing <br/>
Left<br/>
(Trillium Trail). From this point on, when faced with a Left or Right <br/>
choice,<br/>
stay Right.<br/>
<br/>
A Trillium is a wildflower with three petals and three leaves. So, <br/>
continue on<br/>
Trillium Trail until you reach the 3rd place where the path crosses <br/>
through an<br/>
old stone wall. (Along the way the trail will have 3 intersections <br/>
with the<br/>
Pond Trail, but you'll stay on the Trillium Trail.) Stop immediately <br/>
before<br/>
this 3rd stone wall crossing. Listen to the gentle sounds of the <br/>
brook to your<br/>
left. Turn your back to this brook, while still standing on the trail <br/>
just<br/>
before the stone wall. Take 3x3 steps forward off the trail and away <br/>
from the<br/>
brook. Turn to face the stone wall. There should be a tree to each <br/>
side of you<br/>
and a flat topped, knee high boulder in front of you. Looks like a <br/>
nice seat.<br/>
The boulder has a gap under the side facing you  just enough space <br/>
between the<br/>
ground and the rock for a box. A pinkish stone that is a about the <br/>
size of 2<br/>
fists sits in front of the gap to conceal your prize.<br/>
<br/>
After you've stamped in and replace the pink rock, you can easily <br/>
continue on<br/>
to the Hobb's Hill letterbox. To do so, go back to that 3rd stone <br/>
wall, cross<br/>
it and continue along the path (and the brook) until you reach a T <br/>
intersection<br/>
with the Kettle Trail. Now start following the Hobbs Hill clues from <br/>
this<br/>
sentence: "At the next "T" intersection, take the Kettle Trail to the <br/>
left,<br/>
crossing the stream on the boardwalk."<br/>
<br/>
If, on the other hand, you are short on time, simply retrace your <br/>
steps to the<br/>
parking lot.<br/>
