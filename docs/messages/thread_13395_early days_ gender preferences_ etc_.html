&gt; Several of the LBNA pioneers are male. Possibly a majority, I'm not <br/>
&gt; sure of the actual count.<br/>
<br/>
In the early days in the US, there were men and women involved.  Yes, <br/>
there were prolly more men (but I would guess each gender was over 40%,<br/>
depending on _when_), but given the sample size, its meaningless.  (The <br/>
first post Smithsonian letterbox was placed by a woman, and the first <br/>
hand made stamp was also made by a woman, therefore in the "early" days, <br/>
depending on your definition of "early", it was female dominated.  So <br/>
you can draw the line whereever you want with such a small sample size).<br/>
<br/>
And since geocaching arrived 2 years afterwards, the men and women had no<br/>
choice to let any putative gender preferences play out ...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Well that was a generalization - but in the early days of anything<br/>
&gt; it was male dominated. I believe that letterboxing used to require<br/>
&gt; the use and knowledge of a compass - and that alot of boxes had<br/>
&gt; cryptic clues - all things males are (not bashing here) are<br/>
&gt; intrigued by.<br/>
<br/>
It didn't _require_ any of these things.  However, the early people were<br/>
influenced by Dartmoor tradition, which does have those things.  I would<br/>
thus assert that the prevalence of those things in those days was the <br/>
Dartmoor influence, not any gender bias (tho implementation of "cryptic" <br/>
was quite different, and compass use is different, and it makes little<br/>
sense to use Dartmoor notations when we were boxing the entire <br/>
country -- there was a certain "spirit" that some early people tried to <br/>
capture as best they could).  Of course, some people _did_ use GPS in <br/>
those days, (before SA was turned off -- Dave Ulmer "invented" what <br/>
later came to be called geocaching within a few days of SA being turned <br/>
off).<br/>
<br/>
Later, but still early, straightforward directions emerged and began <br/>
to dominate.  I would chalk this up to low barrier to entry and lack <br/>
of developed American tradition.  This was also the time of the emergence <br/>
of the store bought stamp, again, a symptom of low barrier to entry <br/>
(contrary to an assertion made in a another post, most stamps in the early <br/>
days, including New England, _were_ hand carved (I have the logbook to <br/>
prove it), again, it depends what you mean by "early").  Some people <br/>
eschewed the straightforward directions, but for the most part, the <br/>
percentage of straightforward directions is much higher now than in <br/>
the "early days".<br/>
<br/>
Later still, when geocaching.com came on line -- those who were in it for<br/>
the place, ease of entry to the hobby, not into stamp art, and the high <br/>
tech web site with all the logging and other features, went there.  (Moreover,<br/>
Jeremy Irish put alot of energy into promoting geocaching.com thru various<br/>
media (CNN, The New York Times, and so forth), thus people were brought on <br/>
that way.  Most people really didn't want to promote LbNA).  Those that <br/>
were in it for the stamp and vestiges of Dartmoor tradition and secrecy <br/>
and stuff stayed or came to letterboxing.  I would also say that this is <br/>
when we see the commercial stamp start to make its exit, to once again be <br/>
replaced with the hand-carved (in New England) (those that would simply <br/>
buy a commercial stamp just to get in the game perhaps figured it was <br/>
easier to grab a pile of stuff instead) .  I think that explains some of <br/>
the current biases, as opposed to gender (of course, perhaps gender <br/>
indicates _those_ biases, but I would perhaps argue that since both games <br/>
are basically internet games (much to some peoples' chagrin), and <br/>
geocaching.com has more features, it has more appeal to _internet_ users.  <br/>
That is perhaps the dividing characteristic.  I assure you that there are <br/>
many more _non-internet_ letterboxers than geocachers, men and women alike.<br/>
<br/>
Well, just my perspective -- no need for anyone to get inflamed, there is<br/>
no intent in that direction.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
