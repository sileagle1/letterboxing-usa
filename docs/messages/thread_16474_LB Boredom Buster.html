... we are not whining.  We understand that people will have to be good hikers with agility in order to find some boxes.<br/>

Subject: New Travelling Box<br/>
Well, since Pandora cannot get out and box and has asked for an anti-<br/>
boredom remedy, Team PresSinOn decided to come up with a new box, in <br/>
her honor. It's called the Letterbox Boredom Buster. Besides having a <br/>
stamp and a logbook, it also has some goodies to keep those confined <br/>
and unable to box busy for a spell. It kind of runs along the same <br/>
lines as the Purple Heart box. Anyone who is confined and not able to <br/>
get out and box for one reason or another is welcome to request the <br/>
box. This could be someone who's had surgery, broke a body part, is <br/>
confined to a wheelchair and not able to get to alot of boxes, or <br/>
even if you're just having a *really* bad winter and the snow has <br/>
kept you from going anywhere, etc...etc...etc. (I think you all get <br/>
the picture.) ;)<br/>
Pandora now has the box in her possesion and says she's enjoying it. <br/>
Iron Bear will also be stamping into it since he's stuck at home <br/>
taking care of Pandora.  She'll have it until someone else is in need <br/>
of it. Just post that you need it, and she'll send it off to you. <br/>
Then you can keep it till the next person needs it, or contact me and <br/>
you can send it back to me for good keeping until needed again. We'll <br/>
all be on the honor system as to who really needs it. It's not like <br/>
I'm gonna ask for a drs. note or anything. LOL<br/>
Keep on 'Boxin',<br/>

I checked on Neptune beach box at Crab Cove after it was reported missing (by the <br/>
folks you were with), and it was still there, just buried deeply.  However, since then <br/>
there has been a coastal cleanup day, so I should probably check it again!  I need to <br/>
go out there anyway because the books were getting full.<br/>
<br/>
I went through my list of boxes in the San Francisco Bay Area, and determined which <br/>
ones I think are wheelchair accessible.  These all more or less assume that the <br/>
letterboxer in the wheelchair is accompanied by another individual who can actually <br/>
retrieve the box if it is buried under a log, etc.  In other words, access to the site is <br/>
wheelchair friendly.  But if the person is not confined to the wheelchair, then these <br/>
should be fine.<br/>

The Message in the Haunted Mansion (San Francisco) - boxes 1-3 lie along a paved <br/>
path, but the planting spots themselves are between 10-25 feet off the path.  #4 can <br/>
also be accessed by going around on the road rather than up the path. #5 is not <br/>
accessible by wheelchair.<br/>
