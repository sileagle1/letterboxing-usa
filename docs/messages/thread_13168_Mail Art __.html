Have  any letterboxers out there ever  heard of "Mail Art".??<br/>
<br/>
Call me CrAzY ,but I don't like to waste a perfectly good letterbox<br/>
stamp image . <br/>
So I stamp all my utility bill return envelopes with my latest letterbox<br/>
stamps. <br/>
<br/>
The way I see it you can give the postman something to look at<br/>
(and try to figure out what the heck it is ), and on down the line to<br/>
the person that opens the envelope something cool to look at besides a<br/>
boring bland envelope !<br/>
<br/>
Oh Yeah, That's just me with a lot of time on my hands !  LOL  ...<br/>

this since before I was even letterboxing...<br/>

yes franz<br/>
<br/>
been doing it for years when i feel like decorating an envelope......i use rubberstamps (store bought) and color the images in....making a scene or just to match the card i made....<br/>
<br/>
i also one time.....took some foam core...cut a big size (after measuring out say like 6 sizes of the limit of post office.....took the whole big size piece and rubberstamped...colored...a scene....then i took the measurements of post office limit and cut the big size piece into about 6 pieces with a piece protruding into the next piece...(like a puzzle piece)...i did that to all the pieces.....it is now puzzle pieces.....then i put a stamp on it and addressed the back and mailed it to my sister where she assembled the puzzle pieces as they came in ....i mailed a piece from different sections twice a week......extra postage is required for this.....it was neat....the artwork wasnt hugely great but for a "trial" it worked good.....<br/>
<br/>
do a search engine for MAIL ART and you will see some really wierd...odd ....things people have mailed thru the post office....makes you smile at some of it.....<br/>

Yeah, I did a goggle search a while back just looking for letterboxing,&amp;<br/>
stamping information.<br/>
Found what I think you are referring to :<br/>
P22 ! Couple of guys were sending all kinds of crazy things thru the<br/>
mail. The one I remember and like the most was the postage stamped PIECE<br/>
OF TOAST !!<br/>
I wonder if you could get away with that today since   911....??<br/>
