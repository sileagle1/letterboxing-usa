<br/>
Paul and I went searching for the Fab Four today.  We<br/>
found the Beatles and Paul in good shape. That was all<br/>
we had time for today, but it's a pleasant walk in a<br/>
pretty preserve. Hope to return soon to pick up the<br/>
other boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
On the trail we found what may be the remains of<br/>
someone's signature stamp. It looks like a shamrock<br/>
and has been nibbled by a critter. If anyone is<br/>
missing their stamp, I have the remains.  <br/>
<br/>

Oops!  Sorry, I misspoke, it was John we found in good order. <br/>
Paul eluded us, but I understand he's a little harder to find than <br/>
the rest.  Will make another attempt for him on our return.<br/>
