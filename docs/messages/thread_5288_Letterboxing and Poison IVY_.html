Identifying it in the summer and spring is fairly easy when you can see the <br/>
leaves.  However, I have noticed in a bunch of clues (including my own) that <br/>
there is mention of "furry" vines or snakes or whatnot.  Those furry vines <br/>
climbing up trees are also poison ivy.  I can't say that every furry vine is <br/>
poison ivy but I would caution folks to beware of it. I found this out when <br/>
I was camping and decided to burn the "furry wood" and everyone in the camp <br/>
came down with it some even got it internally from the smoke.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!!  The Paint Branch Letterbox (MD) still awaits its first <br/>
visitor... and the Northwest Branch Letterbox (MD) has had a quick showing <br/>
of folks.<br/>
