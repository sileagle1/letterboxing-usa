find Merlin's Grotto. The kids thought that this was the "coolest" hike yet. <br/>
The scramble up to the cave was a blast. The cave itself, well, we couldn't <br/>
explore too much because we had forgotten our flashlights....DOH! We all <br/>
decided that we will be back to explore it more with grungy clothes and <br/>
appropriate lighting. The stamp outside the cave was one of the best we have <br/>
had the pleasure of finding. Excellent artwork Bruce and Aili. We then used <br/>
the "shortcut" (thanks again Bruce and Aili) to find the "The Sword in the <br/>
Stone" box. After placing a stone upon the cairn for good luck we found the <br/>
"Ready Freddy on the Open Road" hitchhiker with the "The Sword in the Stone". <br/>
Who says superstition doesn't pay! We will find a good home for "Freddy" <br/>
Carol Stearns, don't worry. Back down the trail we side stepped and found the <br/>
"Right Hip" box. A very good day to say the least. By the way, it pays to <br/>
have a map of the trails wherever you go. If there is one offered, get it. <br/>
Take the time to study the map for it can be very valuable in saving time and <br/>
effort. Well, our F count is growing so we will see you all on the trails. <br/>
Until then..............<br/>

We're still debating on what/where is next.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone wishing to check out the trail system at Sleeping Giant in <br/>
advance (there are almost always maps at the info board near the <br/>
entrance) they have a pfd format map on the website: <br/>
http://www.sgpa.org/<br/>
There is also one in the Connecticut Walk Book.<br/>
