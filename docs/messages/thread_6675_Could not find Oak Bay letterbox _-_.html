up with three possible general locations (based on differing <br/>
interpretations of the clues) and searched them all quite thoroughly.<br/>
<br/>
If box owners want to contact me privately with clue clarification I <br/>
may be able to get back to the marina before I leave Victoria, to <br/>
ascertain whether the box is actually missing or we just couldn't find <br/>
it. Though I expect it is the former, three adults and two <br/>
enthusiastic children spent well over an hour looking under every <br/>
possible rock. I'll be in Victoria another 5 days.<br/>
