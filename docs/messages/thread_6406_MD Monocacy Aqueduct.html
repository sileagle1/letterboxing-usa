I planted that box on a trip down to Maryland and have yet to see that <br/>
anyone ever stamped in. Living in PA. I have not had a chance to check on it <br/>
yet. It's worth the hunt 'cause it is one of my better,and my favorite, hand <br/>
carved stamp. (Perhaps Wanda and Pete made it down?)<br/>
Squirrel had a box planted on Sugar Loaf Mt. which I wasn't able to locate <br/>
that day, that's right around the corner from the Monocacy box.<br/>
When I planted, the box was located snug in rocks so should not have been <br/>
swept away by flooding.<br/>
Good luck and do let me know if you locate it!!<br/>

Has anyone in Maryland ever found this box?  Monocacy is really close <br/>
to where I work and I would love to find this box if it is not <br/>
actually missing.  Please let me know...I could get in on a lunch <br/>
break!<br/>
