Squirrel's three boxes in the Shepherdstown, WV area.<br/>
<br/>
The directions to the Dam Keepers House and Yankauer Preserve need a<br/>
little modification.  The stop sign 1.7 miles down Shepherd Grade Road<br/>
is no longer there.  It used to be a three way stop, now it is only a<br/>
stop for Scrabble Road.  Keep in eye out for Scrabble Road on your left<br/>
or you'll zip right past it (we did).  If you follow the signs for the<br/>
Wildlife Area, you should find the turn.  Also for the Yankauer<br/>
Preserve, the road name appears to have changed, or at least the road<br/>
sign has.  It doesn't say "Newton School Road", it now read "Whitings<br/>
Neck Rd".  Again, if you follow the signs for the Wildlife Area, you<br/>
will find the preserve with no problem.<br/>
<br/>
The Dam Keepers box was in good shape although not as water tight at it<br/>
once was.  The log book was a bit damp.<br/>
<br/>
The Paw Paw at Yankauer box is also in great shape and right were it<br/>
should be.  The Wildflower at Yankauer box was a bit more of a challenge<br/>
to find.  The preserve folks are repairing/replacing some of the signs<br/>
in the preserve.  One of them is the "Canopy Trees" sign.  We still<br/>
found the box by trying the clues at each "empty" sign we thought might<br/>
be right and, by process of elimination, we eventually found the box. I<br/>
don't know if Two Grey Squirrel wants me to publish more details to find<br/>
the box, but if so, let me know and I'll be happy to.  Also, this box<br/>
was soaked.  We replaced the bag with one we happened to be carrying in<br/>
hopes that the log book might dry out a little.<br/>
<br/>
One last note.  If you are in Shepherdstown and want a great place to<br/>
eat, try the Old Pharmacy Restaurant.  It is on Rt. 230 on the East end<br/>
of town.<br/>
