MORAINE STATE PARK<br/>
PLACED 09022002<br/>
BUTLER COUNTY<br/>
<br/>
THIS LETTERBOX IS NEAR THE MAIN PARK, BUT NOT IN THE PARK PROPER. THERE IS A  OUTLYING AREA OF MORAINE LAKE WHICH IS ACCESSIBLE OFF OF ROUTE 528 (FROM ROUTE 422)]<br/>
<br/>
There are two main entrances into Moraine State park. You do NOT want either of them. ( they are the north shore and the south shore entrances) <br/>
If you are coming from the west of the park you need to pass both of these and go to the Route 528 exit.<br/>
Go north on 528 , at about 2.5 miles you will cross a bridge and see 528 boat launch area, go approximately another mile up the hill and you will see a sign for the North Country Trail on the right side of the road<a href="www.northcountrytrail.com">
NCT</a>    There is also signage there for the Upper 528 Launch Area.<br/>
Park in the lot across the road from the sign.<br/>
There is a sign for the NCT at the entrance of the parking lot.<br/>
sign says OVERLOOK .4 M<br/>
This is where you are going.<br/>
Go across the road to the NCT.<br/>
Do Not take the trail up the hill from the parking lot.<br/>
This trail is blue blazed and very easy to follow.<br/>
Moraine State Park is at the edge of a Glacier. Hence the rocky soil. The area was heavily strip and deep mined for coal. Also there were many oil and gas wells here. In short, the area was a enviromental mess. A dam was built on Muddy Creek (completed 1968) and it took 2 years for the lake to fill. Much work was done on the surrounding grounds to restore them. This area is an outstanding example of enviromental engineering acheivement.<br/>
<br/>
Walk the .4 mile to the overlook. When you get to the overlook enjoy the view then walk another few feet on the trail to the second overlook.<br/>
There is a bench here with NCT carved into it. At the right of this bench is l small tree. <br/>
Stand with your back to this small tree,facing the woods not the view.<br/>
In the woods you will see many trees. But the largest tree is a big Maple. It is approx 30 feet into the woods. Behind this tree and two more almost as big Maple trees, they are in a small group.In the middle of this group is the letterbox, under a flat rock.<br/>
Happy Stamping.<br/>
Good Day to you.<br/>
