<br/>
In the past couple of months as my kids and I have taken to this fun<br/>
activity I've found about 12 boxes and, as my wife has seen our enthusiasm,<br/>
helped me place 2.<br/>
<br/>
I've been reading alot of your emails and 'learned the trade' as I've<br/>
partcipated in this wonderful experience.  The kids were very happy to see<br/>
in one week several entries in our most recent box, including some folks<br/>
from RI.  It is a healthy hobby.<br/>
<br/>
I was intrigued by the article as well - I'm glad to see how it's grown and<br/>
I guess there's alot of boxes here in CT.  I've really enjoyed the email and<br/>
look forward to meeting some of you in the future, either at stamp class, on<br/>
the trail, or at a gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who donate time to make this so much fun.<br/>
<br/>
Question - Can someone translate for me?<br/>
P27 I guess this is Placed, 27? (seems like alot)<br/>
F21 Found 21?<br/>

Wow - letterboxers 'exchange' boxes?  I guess that, after reading some of<br/>
these emails where people go on vacation and place boxes 3 or more states<br/>
away from their homes, that might be cool.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks for the explanation.<br/>

Hi John, I think "Boxer" would be a terrific name for any one named John<br/>
Sullivan. As for the letter designations X is for exchanged and the C count<br/>
was strictly a joke. We had a couple of letterboxes confiscated by the<br/>
