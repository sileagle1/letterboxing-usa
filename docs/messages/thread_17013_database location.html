-Go to the letterbox-usa homepage in Yahoo! Groups.  <br/>
-On the left hand side, there is a column that lists "Database".  Click on that.<br/>
-Then click on "Box status" <br/>
You can click on the blue headers to sort the columns differently.  <br/>
There are 7108 boxes listed on the LbNA site but only 119 listed in this database.  So, perhaps there is another one out there that I don't know about.<br/>

  Okay, so I'm really new and not hugely computer-literate.  What do you mean by 'putting in a database'?  I know of the Letterboxing North America website where I get my clues from.  Do you mean that folks should contact the placer to update the information on that website (as we have) or is there another database out there?<br/>
