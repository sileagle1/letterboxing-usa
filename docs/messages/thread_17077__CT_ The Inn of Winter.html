Leader of the Pack and friends yesterday.  There was a fair amount of <br/>

to visit again, once another hitchhiker comes my way.  I plan to send <br/>
the one I exchanged today on it's way within a week or 2.  <br/>

WOW! Busy place that is, I expected Chuck and maybe Snowbird to get <br/>
there but 6 folks and HH's all passing through I guess it was the <br/>
right time for a hostel to pop up in our neck of the woods. thanks <br/>
for visiting I'll be going by periodically to see who has visited <br/>
and  hope to cross paths with old friends there on occasion. Carol- <br/>
