all.  Not guaranteeing this would work but, hey, I'm<br/>
giving it a shot the next time I'm out.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
Ice Cream in a Bag<br/>
 To do this put 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 1<br/>
tablespoon sugar in a baggie.  I've used sandwich ones<br/>
but think the quart baggies work better (as do freezer<br/>
baggies).  Make sure all the air is out then place the<br/>
baggie with ingredients inside another baggie to keep<br/>
it separate from the ice mixture.  In a gallon baggie<br/>
put 4 cups crushed ice and 4 tablespoons salt.  Put<br/>
the double bagged ingredients in this larger bag. <br/>
Manipulate the baggies with your ingredients through<br/>
the larger bag.  After about 8 minutes you will have<br/>
soft serve ice cream you can eat out of your baggie.<br/>
You can add chocolate syrup or M+Ms if you'd like at<br/>
this point.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if you placed all baggies in a soft<br/>
sided cooler or wrapped them in newspaper for<br/>
insulation if the motion of hiking would mix them up<br/>
enough to have a treat on the trail.  My other thought<br/>
was to put the milk or cream in one thermos and the<br/>
ice in another and mix at destination.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmm<br/>

Simple science rules and I feel like a dummy for never having reasoned<br/>
it out.  Definitely a confound your family type of stunt.  Maybe I<br/>
need to hide these emails in an unmarked folder so they don't find the<br/>
source of my newest secret <grin>!<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it should be insulated with a purple sock ot two?<br/>
