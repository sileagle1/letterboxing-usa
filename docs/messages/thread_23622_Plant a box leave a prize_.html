I know when I found my first box I was just so excited to find the <br/>
box. That was a prize to me. When I found my first HH that was over <br/>

been posting trying to find the person. The HH needs some maintance.<br/>
Well thank you for the information<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's a nice touch but totally unnecessary to leave anything for the first<br/>
finder.  Just *being* the first finder is kind of a reward all in itself.<br/>
But in a way, all it really means if I'm the first finder is that I was the<br/>
first person to have enough time on their hands right after the box was<br/>
planted to go find the box. :-) Being a first finder doesn't mean all that<br/>
much to me I guess.<br/>
<br/>
There have been a couple of boxes that I actually forgot to do anything as<br/>
regards the first finder but I generally design a little first finder<br/>
certificate on the computer and print it out to leave in the box, usually<br/>
with the stamp image stamped on it if there's room.  And then I try to find<br/>
something related to the box or to the area to leave as a first finder gift.<br/>
As the containers get smaller and smaller, it gets tougher and tougher to<br/>
really do much in the way of a first finder gift.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes if the box is out in a forest preserve, I've left a little<br/>
figurine of a frog or a heron, etc.  In their two Long Grove boxes, Pippi &amp;<br/>
Keith left a gift certificate that could be used at any of the shops in Long<br/>
Grove.  In one of her "mystery" boxes, she left a gift certificate to a very<br/>
nearby shopping mall.  In my 2 "Reverence" boxes, I took small squares of<br/>
claybord tiles, made an alcohol ink background on them, stamped the images<br/>
of the box stamps on them, then with a marker I wrote "First Finder" and the<br/>
name of the box and the date placed.  Then I had to leave both gifts in the<br/>
second box because the first box was too small to fit the claybord since it<br/>
can't be folded without ruining it.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes if I have a really good idea of who the first finder is going<br/>
to be, I'll find or make a gift suitable to that person/family.<br/>
<br/>
Do whatever you feel like doing.  Either something..........or nothing at<br/>
all.<br/>
