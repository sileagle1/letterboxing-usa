<br/>
Today Brett and Ginger met Molly at the Vernonia Lake<br/>
Letterbox. (Great stamp Chuck!) She and Ginger are<br/>
having lots of fun. Molly plans to attend the Portland<br/>
Summer gathering before heading back home.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, a family of first time<br/>
letterboxers had just gotten to the letterbox when we<br/>
walked up to the location! These lucky boxers got<br/>
their first box, first hitchhiker, and first exchange<br/>
all at once! I'll bet that hasn't happened many times<br/>
before, if ever. It also made for my first exchange<br/>
not at a gathering.<br/>
<br/>
FYI for all you PNW boxers - this new boxing family<br/>
has already figured out my Bugle Mystery Box and plan<br/>
to get this weekend. As far as I know, only Mark and<br/>
Beth have gotten that one. All you other lazy boxers<br/>
need to get on the ball! :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the HH and entertainment, Chuck!<br/>
<br/>
PS for those wondering about the status of the Ginger<br/>
looking for Molly HH, as of last week it was in New<br/>
York somewhere waiting for a ride to Connecticut.<br/>

planting another of our Monsters of New York series and happened to <br/>
be near the spot where we dropped Ginger "Looking for Molly" back on <br/>
26 June, so we decided to take a peek and see if anyone had picked <br/>
her up.  Nope, still there.  Interestingly enough, another 'boxer <br/>
had been there after we'd dropped her off but left her there.  They <br/>
were first time 'boxers, had only just discovered the hobby and web <br/>
site.  I'm not sure if they were familiar with hitchhikers, they <br/>
didn't even stamp into the Ginger log book.  So, she's still in the <br/>
Finger Lakes.  Not a bad place to spend your summer, I guess.  <br/>
