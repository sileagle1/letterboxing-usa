left not ashes and ruins, but creative fires burning. I think the <br/>
LetterboxingCentral.com and the Letterboxing.com sites are both <br/>
looking pretty good. Eric Mings and the and Coxes are coming up with <br/>
some interesting concepts and configurations on their sites and I <br/>
support them both in their efforts.<br/>
<br/>
It's no secret that I, along with MANY others have an affinity for <br/>
letterboxing "regalia". It looks like Bill and Val Cox are going to <br/>
be coming up with some great letterboxing design merchandise. It's <br/>
their living, they're good at it, and we're lucky to have fellow <br/>
letterboxers "in the business"!<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the good work, guys. This is getting exciting!<br/>

Thanks for the support. The link to LbNA is under the Links section <br/>
heading "letterboxing collection sites." All links are in the links <br/>
section. If folks think a better heading is appropriate I would be <br/>
willing to change it. I do believe there may be an LbNA link to the <br/>
letterboxing.com site found in Randy's FAQ on the LbNA site. I am <br/>
also glad to see the letterboxingcentral site come on line. I like <br/>
the look of it very much.<br/>
<br/>
If someone bothers to read this far in my message, I will give you a <br/>
preview of things to come. I will post a message on this subject in <br/>
the next day or so. There is now a publicly available Letterboxing <br/>
ONLY internet search engine on my site. It has thus far indexed over <br/>
1100 letterboxing related web pages on the net and I am looking for <br/>
more today. To check it out use the "everything letterboxing" link on <br/>
the Letterboxing International site.<br/>

I had not been to your Letterboxing International website for some <br/>
time, but took a look this morning. It is a handsome site with some <br/>
very attractive features. Congratulations on your good work.<br/>
