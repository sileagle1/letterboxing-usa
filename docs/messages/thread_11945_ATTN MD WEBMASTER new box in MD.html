Follow the nicely paved trail        (even if it's not yellow bricks)To the far end of the fence        (be sure to watch out for ticks)Turn right where the chain links end        (watch out for thorns in the mix) Keep on the rocky old trail        (till you almost wind up in the drink)Turn left in the dirt path at the creek        (and follow along it's brink)Soon the bike path's bridge is in sight        (be sure in the mud you don't sink) Up on the hill are some rocks        (the second cliff is your sign)Look for a large tumbled tree        (I don't think it was ever a pine)In the stump from which it fell        (where termites surely to dine)You will find where the mushroom was hid        (with a rock to act as it's lid)  <br/>
