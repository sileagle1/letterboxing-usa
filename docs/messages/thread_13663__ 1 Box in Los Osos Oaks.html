intact but the stamp- Pandora found it like that and rescued the <br/>
remains and contacted Ryan, who reported that has plans to recarve <br/>
and replant it with Amanda, but that might take a while...<br/>
<br/>
But yes, I would take that walk over and over again- it is different <br/>
at different times of the year, and it just feels magical to me.<br/>
<br/>
I like your bow with the two arrows, which Sir Balthazar and I saw <br/>
plenty of times when we were checking our boxes yesterday evening!  <br/>
It is strange to feel you know someone from a stamped image- I feel <br/>
that way too.<br/>

&gt; I saw your stamp a great many times while boxing in the SLO<br/>
&gt; area last weekend. It almost feels like a face-to-face meeting when <br/>
one goes <br/>
&gt; from online moniker to stamp! <br/>
&gt; I think I remember seeing your stamp in the Los Osos Oaks series <br/>
boxes don't <br/>
&gt; I? Is that the most amazing piece of oak-covered earth you've ever <br/>
seen, or is <br/>
&gt; it just me? Question: is the #1 box there really missing or are the <br/>
rumors <br/>
&gt; just rumors?<br/>
