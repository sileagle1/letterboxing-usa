&gt;It's not the people reading this list that I'm concerned about or<br/>
&gt;criticizing!  In this sue-happy society of ours, even if somebody's<br/>
&gt;lawsuit is hopeless, it could destroy you financially before it's<br/>
&gt;thrown out of court.  If you're visible, you're a target.<br/>
<br/>
I think it may be you who doesn't see our point. We understand what you are <br/>
saying. It is just that most of think you are grossly over-reacting. Nobody <br/>
is going to sue over their own stupidity. There have been trail books in <br/>
various parts of this country for many years and nobody has sued them. What <br/>
you fear won't happen because there just aren't going to be a lot of people <br/>
who do this.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;My goal is to try to avoid extra rules and regulations.  Compared to<br/>
&gt;the alternative, adding a few extra facts to the clues shouldn't be<br/>
&gt;that bad.<br/>
<br/>
Please don't bring your rules and regulations to Connecticut. I fear you'll <br/>
ruin the fun.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;All this wonderful advice everyone is giving about safety is like<br/>
&gt;preaching to the choir.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we chose that manner rather than attack you personally as you have <br/>
chosen to do. Carolyn does get it, there was no need for that comment.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Why can't anybody see this?<br/>

<br/>
Because we can see the forest from the trees. Why can't you? People are <br/>
mostly embarrassed when they get lost in the woods and aren't going to <br/>
broadcast it when there are no deep pockets to sue. You've made your point, <br/>
but the whole lot of us apparently think you're over reacting. Immensely I <br/>
might add.<br/>
