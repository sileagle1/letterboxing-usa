                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to thank all you mid-Atlantic folks again for a great <br/>
weekend!  Not only did we get to reconnect with some friendly familiar <br/>
faces, but we also managed to turn 2 former S's to X's, put new faces <br/>
to 8 previously seen stamps, and even get 2 new exchanges-in-the-wild <br/>
on Sunday!  Perhaps the biggest surprise of the weekend was gently <br/>
tapping on this quiet fellow's elbow and asking him if he was a <br/>
letterboxer - only to find out that he was the mapsurfer himself!    <br/>
What a delight!  Too bad I was still not feeling well enough to make <br/>
my depleted energy reserves last through dinner on Saturday, but we <br/>
did manage to find quite a few more boxes on Sunday, including our 2nd <br/>
mid-Atlantic hitcher(Harry the Hornblower) at yet another mystery <br/>
location soon to be posted on our new hitcher tracking webpage!<br/>
<br/>
We also found Mukluk's Peace Valley boxes all in good order, but <br/>
the particular dry creek bed in question was certainly not dry when we <br/>
were there in the morning after Saturday night's heavy rain! Creekside <br/>
in Tyler Park appears to be missing, and possibly 70 Million Years Ago <br/>
in NJ as well, but everything else that we found was in fine shape.<br/>
Only wish I'd felt better and had more time, but maybe next trip!<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, we just want all of you to know how much we appreciate your <br/>
efforts in promoting letterboxing in your area, both with your <br/>
prolific plantings of interesting boxes and with your <br/>
joyful,gracious and cooperative spirits!<br/>
Hope to see you all sometime in CT/RI,<br/>
maybe for the May 11th Gathering <br/>
at the Sleeping Giant!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>
Wanda and Pete<br/>
