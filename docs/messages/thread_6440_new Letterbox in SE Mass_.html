<br/>
&gt; a new letter box for the cape and the islands!<br/>
&gt; i've been enjoying letterboxing for the past week, and here's something<br/>
new<br/>
&gt; for those whose boxes i've been searching.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; another lighthouse to fill out the lighthouse series already in existence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Placed by:  Elizabeth Aukamp.  part of The Usual Suspects.<br/>
&gt; Name of the Box:  The Box at Nobsque Light.<br/>
&gt; Placed on:  July, 23, 2002.<br/>
&gt; Located in:  Barnstable County, Massachusetts.<br/>
&gt; Closest to:  Falmouth and Woods Hole, Massachusetts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; DIRECTIONS TO THE LIGHT HOUSE:<br/>
&gt; from rte. 28 south:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - as you come into Falmouth there will be a sign for 28 off to the left.<br/>
&gt; continue going straight on the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Woods Hole Road.  At the flashing light continue to your right, you will<br/>
&gt; have no choice but to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; continue this way.  pass the Quissett Light, continuing straight.<br/>
&gt; - turn left onto Nobska Road.<br/>
&gt; - continue to the stop sign.<br/>
&gt; - at the stop sign turn right.  (this is still Nobska Road, but Oyster<br/>
Pond<br/>
&gt; Road is to the left.)<br/>
&gt; - continue around curves until you reach the light house at the top of the<br/>
&gt; hill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; DIRECTIONS TO THE BOX:<br/>
&gt; Walk away from the lighthouse and cross the road.  There will be a sandy<br/>
&gt; lookout area.  Find the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; rock with the small metal "Survey Mark."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From here, walk down to the rock, taking the left path.  (Be very Careful<br/>
&gt; here on your way down!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When you reach the level area find the rock with the "Bench Mark."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again take the left trail of large rocks, going down to the level area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Continue around the point to the right, making your way to the grey<br/>
granite<br/>
&gt; rock with a vertical<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; orange stripe.  Standing upon it, step down and to the right over three<br/>
&gt; large flat rocks and stop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Looking out to sea, you should see a large rock approximately fifty feet<br/>
&gt; out, directly in line with the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; left edge of a middle Elizabeth Island.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Look at the ground to your right for another  large granite rock with<br/>
orange<br/>
&gt; stripes.  Examine it for<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; your Box.<br/>
