<br/>
I'm a newbie.  Planning on hunting my 1st box this weekend if the weather cooperates.  Have been spending the week making our (me and the kids) stamps.<br/>
<br/>
We're planning a 3-week trip to Belgium and surrounding countries later this winter and were wondering if there is any letterboxing activity in those countries?  Or is it just Dartmoor and the US?<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I get a better feel for the "clue-writing" process, I'll start planning some boxes to hide in the area around here (not Europe, unless there's activity there)<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the good work.  I look forward to this new hobby.  And I enthusiastically support your effort to reach our to children.<br/>
<br/>
