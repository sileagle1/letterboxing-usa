 Ive been lurking for about a month now. I found out about letterboxing<br/>
through<br/>
an article written in a small newsletter published by folk singer,<br/>
Michael Cooney, called<br/>
The Friendship Letter. I was quite intrigued and immediately started<br/>
gathering stamp<br/>
carving supplies. Well today we set out our first boxes at Ringing Rocks<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just missed a chance at your new boxes, Space Traveler, as I was down <br/>
in Bucks County two weeks ago. We have a Prayer Rock letterbox, a <br/>
Rolling Rock letterbox, and now Ringing Rocks! I'm sure there must be <br/>
other similar ones as well that I'm not remembering.<br/>
<br/>
John De Wolf will get your clues posted (and boxes found) in short <br/>
order, I'm sure.<br/>

&gt; Hello All<br/>
&gt;  I've been lurking for about a month now. I found out about letterboxing<br/>
&gt; through<br/>
&gt; an article written in a small newsletter published by folk singer,<br/>
&gt; Michael Cooney, called<br/>
&gt; "The Friendship Letter". I was quite intrigued and immediately started<br/>
&gt; gathering stamp<br/>
&gt; carving supplies. Well today we set out our first boxes at Ringing Rocks<br/>
&gt; Park in Bucks<br/>
&gt; County, PA.. Directions are as follows:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   RINGING ROX BOXES<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BOX #1<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;From the parking lot, take the trail past the trash can.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Follow this trail to the first fork, and take the left one, which will<br/>
&gt; lead to the field of<br/>
&gt; boulders. DON'T FORGET YOUR HAMMER!! A tire iron will work OK, but a<br/>
&gt; hammer is<br/>
&gt; best.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The field of rocks also seems to fork, and you need to wend your way<br/>
&gt; through the left<br/>
&gt; side. As you approach the end of the field, look for a cone shaped rock<br/>
&gt; with a deep "Y"<br/>
&gt; shaped crack near the top of it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;From this rock, look for two large oak trunks at the edge of the field<br/>
&gt; that form a "V". This<br/>
&gt; is in a roughly northerly direction. You cannot trust a compass here<br/>
&gt; because of the<br/>
&gt; composition of the rocks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Standing in the "V" of these trunks, take a bearing of 320, cross a<br/>
&gt; trail,  and walk 78<br/>
&gt; paces to another pair of "V" forming trunks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ten paces beyond this you will discover a pair of rusted fenders.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Standing between the fenders bear 220 for 28 paces to the fallen logs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Seek here and you shall find.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Box #2<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Return to the trail and bear 60 passing "AC91"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Go down hill till you come to a tree with nubby bark and an upside down<br/>
&gt; "T" carved into<br/>
&gt; the trunk.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bear to the left of this tree and continue down hill.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Listen for the water as you angle over to the right - head toward the<br/>
&gt; water.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ah... There it is: a cascade of water over step like rocks.  Climb down<br/>
&gt; to the stream and<br/>
&gt; follow it up hill to a large upward slanting table of rock.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Continue to follow this flat table up stream until you come to a small<br/>
&gt; pool.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a tree at the pool's eastern edge, from this tree, site due<br/>
&gt; west and you will see<br/>
&gt; a cavelet up in the rocks at about 50 yards distance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You will find it in the cavelet on the left side.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Continue upstream to a very pleasant waterfall. The trail leads to the<br/>
&gt; top of the falls<br/>
&gt; and thence it is a well worn path back to the parking lot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy Hunting<br/>
