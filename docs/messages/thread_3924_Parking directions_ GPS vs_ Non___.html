worth...<br/>

Your method would probably eliminate me finding your boxes...the main reason<br/>
being that we keep a binder in the car with clues printed out for the states<br/>
that we usually travel in (basically all of New England and upstate NY).<br/>
That way, if we find ourselves with some free time or the desire to<br/>
letterbox in an area, we don't have to have a computer handy to determine<br/>
where the nearby boxes are.<br/>
<br/>
However, I also believe that your clues should be what you want them to be,<br/>
and if they don't appeal to me, I just won't search out your boxes, no big<br/>
deal.  I'm sure some people find our clues too easy (for the one box we<br/>
planted, but there are more in the works)...we all have different reasons<br/>
and goals for letterboxing, so whatever works...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Last summer a number of comments were made about GPS coordinates.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; am a converted Geocacher and an electronics nerd, so using a GPS is<br/>
&gt; &gt; second nature.  I realize that not everyone is.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In several of my box clue sheets I tire of giving road by road<br/>
&gt; &gt; directions to a parking spot where I would like for the fun to<br/>
&gt; &gt; start.  I have occasionally just given the coordinates and said<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; this could be found with a GPS or by using the free topographic map<br/>
&gt; &gt; service www.topo.com.  It seems the easiest way to let someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually know where they should park to eliminate parking from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; puzzle.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In none of these parking coordinate clues has a GPS been needed.<br/>
&gt; The<br/>
&gt; &gt; coordinates are just a shorthand to get you to a map of the area.<br/>
&gt; An<br/>
&gt; &gt; example is the "Rediscovery" box set I just posted.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Feedback?  Who among you wants road by road directions to a parking<br/>
&gt; &gt; spot vs the coordinate clue?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Very, very well put, especially for all the "new" letterboxers<br/>
&gt; &gt; out there and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even us "old" ones. We can learn from your comments.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; True, especially for certain styles of letterbox clues.  There is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; much wisdom in that post.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; OTOH, for other styles, specific, obvious landmark detail and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; redundancy would compromise the challenge that the hunters of<br/>
&gt; these<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sorts of boxes are attracted to.  Not everyone is attracted to<br/>
&gt; these<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sorts of boxes.  Armchair treasure hunters are used to having to<br/>
&gt; &gt; deal<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with the fingerprints of towns, trails, roads, and other<br/>
&gt; features,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; extracting subtlety from vague clues, and realise that things<br/>
&gt; &gt; change<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; over time.  I will be revisiting the disclaimer on my web page<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; says my boxes are hard and not for the easily disappointed.  All<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; clues are listed with date planted so that those who are aware of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; way things change can factor that in.  It is important to be<br/>
&gt; aware<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; things can change.  The only constants are contour detail, large<br/>
&gt; &gt; rocks,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and some streams and other water features.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd call them "treasureboxes" if the term "letterbox" conjures up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; some image of the way things ought to be, to avoid confusion or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; having people be frustrated.  If most of you feel my letterboxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't fit the mold, as it were, its fine with me if the<br/>
&gt; webmasters<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't link to them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just as the popularity of geocaching _has_ proven (at least to<br/>
&gt; me),<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that GPS coordinates make acceptable clues for these sorts of<br/>
&gt; &gt; things,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we may want to be open to _all_ sorts of clues, and ignore the<br/>
&gt; ones<br/>
&gt; &gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't like.  I don't like geocaches in general so I ignore them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But they are still fair game for those who do enjoy them.  This<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; one example.  There is no (IMHO) "right" way to write a letterbox<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; clue -- the hider does not owe the hunter a fun hunt, as there<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; too many hunters and you cannot write something that will please<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone.  For my part, I will never intentionally write a clue<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; knowingly involves trespass, hazards, has errors, or is<br/>
&gt; &gt; intentionally<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; frustrating or unsolvable, but "hard" and "subtle" seem in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; spirit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of treasure hunting to me.  I will say, that based on off-list<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; comments, that I believe you missed a key part of one of the<br/>
&gt; boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have alluded to that lead to a longer than expected hike.<br/>
&gt; Moderate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to difficult clues can often be easily misinterpreted.  I've done<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it myself too many times to count.  I was at the park last week,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the terrain has not changed from when I wrote that clue.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's funny but the box's that have been placed in problem areas,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with vague clues and landmarks seem to be the ones that have no<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stamps in them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would actually expect this to be the case.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, good, solid advice, but I don't think one-size-fits-all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; advice.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Happy hunting and good luck :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers<br/>
