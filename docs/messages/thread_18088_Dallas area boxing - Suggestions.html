&gt; I'll be in the greater Dallas area for a few days, the week after <br/>
Easter.<br/>
&gt; I may have part time access to a car around dinnertime once or <br/>
twice.<br/>
&gt; I didn't see too many boxes listed for that neck o' the woods.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Are there any that can be found in a 1-2 hour excursion?<br/>
&gt; I'll be staying in Plano.<br/>
&gt; Thanks.<br/>

My Texas Star LB was alive &amp; well as of 12/24/03 and is within<br/>
an hour drive from Plano.  The park where it is located<br/>
(Fair Park) is worth spending some time in, too.<br/>
As for the other boxes listed, Bob Woodward Park LB is missing<br/>
and the owner can't be contacted.  I found Spider's Lair last<br/>
summer and now there is another one in that same park called<br/>
Halloween.  These would also be close enough for you to visit.<br/>
I plan to try for Halloween LB soon and will let you know its<br/>
status if I do.  The person that placed Halloween also placed<br/>
a box called Memorial Day, but it is no longer listed so not<br/>
sure what happened to it.  You might try contacting the placer<br/>
and ask.  There were also some other boxes listed on the old<br/>
site but I could not find them last summer and they are presumed<br/>
missing and non-maintained.  Hope this helps and consider placing<br/>
a box of your own to help populate this sparse area of Texas.<br/>
