another place for the human race to populate and industrialize.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Interesting to think about.  I would think letterboxes would precede geocaches since they don't require GPS and the satellite system to make them work.  For several years I thought about trying to place a box in the International Space Station, but I no longer have contacts at NASA or know any astronauts.  But, now that the Shuttle no longer flies there, maybe I can find someone at Spacex.  Hmmm ...<br/>
