This may be shocking but, her Ladyship has to respectfully disagree<br/>
with you. Those who suspected her Ladyship of being the mysterious<br/>
Emily Post doppelganger of the recent "Inspector Bacon" thread (and<br/>
she most certainly was not) may not believe this but the her Ladyship<br/>
sees a benefit to the more free and unchecked opinions expressed on<br/>
list-serves. Please make no mistake, civil social intercourse seems to<br/>
be a lost art but is one for which her Ladyship has the greatest<br/>
admiration. The computer revolution has however, brought society into<br/>
new and uncharted waters. E-mail and list serve etiquette is still<br/>
evolving and ideas and rules are rapidly changing but one thing is<br/>
clear; the anonymity and the absence of eye contact in internet<br/>
discussion forums leads many to be more open, and in her Ladyship's<br/>
opinion, honest with their opinions. <br/>
<br/>
Her Ladyship has always regarded the internet discussion groups and<br/>
refreshingly forthright. Sometimes it is refreshing to have ones ideas<br/>
subjected to honest criticism. Yes, that can be harsh and difficult to<br/>
take but, an honest harsh criticism is more constructive than empty<br/>
praise. Her Ladyship has always welcomed intelligent, open and<br/>
unvarnished criticism of her creative endeavors and seeks the opinions<br/>
of those who are most capable of pointing out flaws. Hard as it may be<br/>
to take it is more helpful than a friend who, although motivated by<br/>
affection, gushes effusively over your efforts regardless of how awful<br/>
they may, in reality be. Let's face it someone should have told many<br/>
of those millions of American Idol auditionees (pardon the neologism)<br/>
the truth before they ended up displayed as fools for all of America<br/>
to point to laugh at. <br/>
<br/>
This discussion forum like many, provokes harsh commentary but,<br/>
usually there is an honesty to it that one can learn from. I dare say<br/>
that the tone would be far more civil were it a discussion group held<br/>
face to face as a salon but it would likely take much longer to get at<br/>
the truth. <br/>
<br/>
The anonymity works both ways as well. One can put ones ideas and<br/>
opinions out there and have them shot down as ridiculous or inane but<br/>
very few know who you are in the real world so you can turn of the<br/>
computer and walk away from it with out retaining the reputation of a<br/>
fool (as long as you don't continue to use the same screen name). One<br/>
can explore different facets of their personality creating different<br/>
persona without doing so in the real world and still get real world<br/>
feedback. This opens the possibility of tremendous introspection and<br/>
exploration of self that never existed before the internet. <br/>
<br/>
Her Ladyship views internet discussion groups as a unique entity that<br/>
allows opinion to be freely expressed unchecked by politeness or even<br/>
political correctness and that is something we don't really have<br/>
anywhere else. The tone may get unpleasant at times but reality can be<br/>
unpleasant too and at times it's good to have a place to test ones<br/>
ideas in the most extreme circumstances.<br/>

mind the following little ditty (with apologies to Mr. Disney)<br/>
<br/>
When you type upon a board, makes no difference who you are<br/>
Anything you have to say may come back to you<br/>
<br/>
If your thought is unseemly, no flame is too extreme<br/>
When you type upon a board as boxers do<br/>
<br/>
(Fate is hot, it brings to those who slam<br/>
The burning retort of others opinions)<br/>
<br/>
Like a jolt of ohms and volts, fate can burn without concern<br/>
When you type upon a board, you are at risk.<br/>
