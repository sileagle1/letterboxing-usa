                    <html><body><p>My sister-in-law recently found this box and told me about all the people from all over the country who have visited it. Even though I have only heard from the family from DC, I want to thank the rest of you for taking some time out of your day to enjoy the hike and Nine Corners Lake.</p>
<p>My daughter, her friend, and I will be doing the hike in the next couple of days. We are excited about getting to learn about the other LBs who have come our way.</p>
<p>Safe travels, E</p><p><br/></p><hr size="1"/><b>Do You Yahoo!?</b><br/>
