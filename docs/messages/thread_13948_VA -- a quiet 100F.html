                    <div class="plaintext-content">It should have been a dark and stormy night when we set out to find the Dr. <br/>
Frankenstein's boxes.  There should have been lightening, thunder and heavy <br/>
rains.  But, since we'd been experiencing that for the entire Spring, we <br/>
were happy to set out under the sunshine!<br/>
<br/>
After boxing for almost a year (anniversary in Sept), team BeMa was in <br/>
search of our 100th Find (boxes or HH -- we count exchanges separately)!!  <br/>
We were at number 98 and Dr. Frankenstein (cleverly hiding under the name <br/>
"Rich") had placed two boxes at Providence Rec center.  The ground was <br/>
familiar for it was here that the infamous Ha had basically failed her puppy <br/>
obedience course (before it was cancelled due to the sniper).<br/>
<br/>
We parked in the lot and searched for the paved path.  Ironically, we parked <br/>
right in front of where we would end up, but, ended up making a circuit of <br/>
the whole lot looking for the paved path and then following right back!  <br/>
Hate when that happens!!<br/>
<br/>
The search was amazingly uneventful for our crew!  At Frankenbox, Be decided <br/>
to poke the nice log we were sitting on to stamp.  Out from a little hole <br/>
came a torrent of ants, swarming all over the log sending Miss Ma screaming <br/>
and ink pads flying!  O.K.  -- so that was a little exciting...<br/>
<br/>
We headed back on the path toward Bride of Frankenbox optimistic that number <br/>
100F was at hand!!  What a nice clear clue -- cut logs on both sides of the <br/>
path -- you don't miss that too easily!  After circling around the logs the <br/>
wrong way, we found the box.  Lo and behold -- within Bride of Frankenbox <br/>
was an old friend -- the Cooties HH!<br/>
<br/>
Now, some people get really nice, almost poetic boxes to mark major <br/>
milestones such as the 100th find (or in the case of CT boxers -- 100th for <br/>
that afternoon...)  We get the choice of Bride of Frankenbox (which I refuse <br/>
to take personally being the closest thing to a bride on the team -- Miss Ma <br/>
is way too young although she has her future fianc picked out already  -- <br/>
and a back up one just in case....) or a case of the Cooties!!  The choices <br/>
may not be romantic or inspirational, but, we were extremely excited to <br/>
reach 100 and start on the next 100 right away!!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to Rich for some more great clues.  We loved seeing all the boxes <br/>
from which you borrowed directions!  You are very creative!<br/>
<br/>
We look forward to putting our LBNA patch on our backpack so you can all <br/>
look for it if we pass in the woods!  Although, knowing us, it won't be the <br/>
first thing you'll see or hear if we are anywhere close by!!  BeMa<br/>
<br/>
P9 (Peace of DC will be replanted soon)  F100!!<br/>
