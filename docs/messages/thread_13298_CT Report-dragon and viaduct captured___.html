                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!! That's incredible- the Black Bear was only in his cave with the <br/>
Dragon of Krakow for less than 1/2 a day-- guess he didn't like the <br/>
company-HA.  Swamp Yankee and I started our day by finding our 1st <br/>
Chuck + Molly box- what a great stamp-Thanks Chuck. We also had our <br/>
grandson with us for his first letterboxing experience- he's only 19 <br/>
months, so he can only go where his stroller can negotiate.  Later <br/>
today he and i returned to the Airline Trail to get the Rapollo <br/>
Viaduct box- success!!! He now has his very own handcut stamp--I've <br/>
called him "BOO" since he was very little, so if you see a blue ghost <br/>
in a logbook, don't be scared!!!<br/>
Also, if you go for the Nehantic State Forest Stamp--- be careful to <br/>
step on clumps of grass.  If you don't, you may sink to your knee in <br/>
swamp goo (not that I would know-but, thank God for Goretex <br/>
hikers!!!!)  Sunshine <br/>
