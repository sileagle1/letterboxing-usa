Iron`Bear and his girl pandora have planted a letter box at Powell's <br/>
City of Books in downtown Portland.  The bookstore is located on the <br/>
corner of 10th &amp; West Burnside.<br/>
<br/>
Placed: March 11th  2003<br/>
Created by: Iron`Bear and his girl pandora (Iron-Bear@lycos.com  &amp; <br/>
hispandora@phlsystems.com)<br/>
Number in series: 1<br/>
Terrain Difficulty: Parking might be a chore but that is it.  A nice <br/>
indoor hunt great for those rainy days in Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
This is a very popular bookstore in Portland.  It is located downtown <br/>
and parking may take some ingenuity.  The bookstore is very busy and <br/>
discretion is necessary as the letterbox was planted without the <br/>
knowledge of the staff.  The clues are not very difficult per se, <br/>
however there are several of them and it can be a bit time <br/>
consuming.  It is definitely a letterbox to do on a rainy day in <br/>
Portland.  Powell's has a caf and tons of books and is located near <br/>
some very cool downtown shops.  You might even want to make a day of <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
You are about to learn about and explore a fantasy world created by <br/>
an author that began writing in the early 1960's.<br/>
<br/>
Inside Powell's the hunt begins!<br/>
<br/>
Your journey starts at Powell's City of Books in downtown Portland.  <br/>
Once inside your journey begins in the caf.  Grab a cup of black <br/>
wine you are going to need it.  From here, you will begin to find <br/>
your first clue.<br/>
<br/>
This fantasy world is about honor and doing what is right.  In this <br/>
world, if someone were to insult a Man's woman that Man might seek <br/>
revenge.  When you find the row that you should be in the first <br/>
letter of the second word under this section will be your first <br/>
letter clue.<br/>
<br/>
This fantasy world had three moons that shown like pearls in the <br/>
sky.  Go to the highest level of the bookstore for your next clue.  <br/>
<br/>
In this place find where people go to ask questions.  Around the <br/>
question mark, you will find your next letter clue.<br/>
<br/>
In this fantasy world Castes were an important part of society.  A <br/>
Warrior would wear a scarlet tunic.  Go to the room a Warrior would <br/>
be in for your next clue.<br/>
<br/>
To learn more about Iron`Bear you might want to read some books on <br/>
Native American Myths.  Iron`Bear has eight letters in his name.  <br/>
Your next letter will be found directly under the far right eight <br/>
when facing the center of the room.<br/>
<br/>
The Ubar of a city in this world was a King in his own right.  You <br/>
will find your next clue in a room of the colors and Ubar would <br/>
wear.  This is surely a room befitting royalty.  <br/>
<br/>
This world was based on philosophy like that Aristotle and Plato <br/>
wrote.  Find these philosophers.  While you are here stop for a drink <br/>
at a near by fountain.  On your left will be a black sign.  In the <br/>
fantasy world Men would be listed first.  Nevertheless, at the end of <br/>
both sexes' you will find your next letter.  <br/>
<br/>
Another high Caste of this world was a Physician.  The doctor and his <br/>
answers for "wellness" can be found in section 101 of the next room.  <br/>
