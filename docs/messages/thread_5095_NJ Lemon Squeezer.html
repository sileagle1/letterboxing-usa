<br/>We drove to the trail head but were unable to find parking ........... gotta get there early I guess.  We checked the map and decided to park at Lake Skannatati and go up that way. We've been up the red dot trail past Black and Bald Rocks before so I was disappointed we couldn't go up that way today .............. it's a neat hike,  but I was also very please to see this other part of the Park.  There had been a fire recently just past the Cape Horn Mine on the Long Path.  Between the fiire and the old mine it was quite an interesting place.  
<br/>
<br/>Soon after we arrived at the Lemon Squeezer it began to rain and there were rumblings in the distance, so we didn't hang around very long.  We hiked up to the top, had no trouble finding the box (which is in great shape), and stamped in.  
<br/>
<br/>Don, we had a great hike to another place I probably would never have gone without a letterbox to find.  Thanks!
<br/>
<br/>Looking forward to your next one.

To finally get back to you on your 1st e-mail/post, yes, your boxes did beat <br/>
mine as Harriman's 1st.  You got me by a day (your post wasn't up when I <br/>
planted it), but 1st is 1st.  Our esteemed webmaster already caught the <br/>
"1st" question and rightfully took it out of the clues.  Since you found the <br/>
box, you saw the note in the stamp book, which it would have been your right <br/>
to clarify.<br/>
<br/>
No problem - the important thing is we finally have some boxes there (how <br/>
did we not have any boxes placed there in the past 3 years and have 4 placed <br/>
within 24 hrs?!?!), and hopefully more to come.  I have some ideas - now I <br/>
need the time...<br/>
<br/>
Glad you enjoyed the hike.  The fire also hit the B&amp;B Rocks area - very <br/>
interesting hiking.<br/>
<br/>
Don<br/>

&gt;Don,  Mary and I found your Lemon Squeezer Letterbox today.  Although it's<br/>
&gt;not the goal, it is fun to be the first. :)<br/>

&gt;other part of the Park.  There had been a fire recently just past the Cape<br/>
