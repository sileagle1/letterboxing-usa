Glad to say that despite the wet weather, "Walking Weekend" in <br/>
CT was definitely not a complete wash-out for us this year! We <br/>
took in quite a few of the nature and history walks, slipped back <br/>
to RI briefly for the mystery gathering, and even managed to <br/>
squeeze in a bit of letterboxing between walks on Sunday and <br/>
Monday! The most fun walk of all, though, was probably taking <br/>
Pete on the trail of the "Ants Go Marching" yesterday in Hampton, <br/>
CT. I'd gone up there a few days earlier and was just charmed by <br/>
those cute little ant stamps! Now, Pete wants to count them as a <br/>
series of 10 (instead of just 1), since we did manage to find all <br/>
10 ants, and it does seem sort of unfair that someone who might <br/>
find just 1 or 2 of the ants and then sign the logbook at the end <br/>
would get the same count (1) as someone who takes the time to <br/>
find more or all of them! I maintain that just getting the whole <br/>
stamp collection of the cute little fellows doing all those strange <br/>
little things is its own reward, but I would also be curious to hear <br/>
other people's opinions. At any rate, don't miss checking out <br/>
those cool ants!  I also have to say I got the biggest charge <br/>
thinking about those revolutionary women baring arms for the <br/>
cause of freedom at Irishtinker's great new series in Coventry, <br/>
CT! We're certainly lucky to have so many talented carvers and <br/>
planters in our neck of the woods! Thanks again, guys!<br/>

                    <html><body><p>I think that every box found should count as a find but they all should have books in them as well as stamps. I saw that the planter said to find the 10 boxes but count it as 1 find. I didn't care too much for that idea and never bothered to get out to them even though I am familier with the area. I would hope the planter makes adjustments even if it means redoing the clues to make each box a find. That's just my thinking on the subject and I mean no disrespect to the planter or anyone who does not mind the original idea.....Chuck and Molly
