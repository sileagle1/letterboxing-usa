On June 9th The Dartmoor National Park Authorities re-opened over 60% of<br/>
Dartmoor National Park, to public access.<br/>
<br/>
The heartland and home of British Letterboxing has been closed all year as<br/>
a defence against the Foot &amp; Mouth epidemic that has been sweeping the<br/>
United Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
A collective sigh of relief and an unconstrained cry of joy echoed across<br/>
the moor as all us letterboxers who have missed and wept for our wonderful<br/>
Dartmoor have been given access once again to begin Letterboxing in 2001.<br/>
<br/>
During the closure "green wellie" walks have sprung up around the<br/>
perimeters of Dartmoor, in the coddled ancient market towns of Devon which<br/>
surround the moors.<br/>
<br/>
Walks which led between ancient churches and old market squares took<br/>
Letterbox hunters to off-moor boxes set out to slake the insatiable thirst<br/>
for their hobby. That many of these walks ultimately culminated with boxes<br/>
in cosy pubs made the slaking of other thirsts developed on such<br/>
expeditions all the more delightful.<br/>
<br/>
But these were mere make goods.  We still mourned our moors.<br/>
<br/>
That we have taken Letterboxing for granted, that for 150 years the open<br/>
wind and rain swept moors have been home to our gentle pursuit and that we<br/>
expected them forever to be so, is now clearly something that we know is a<br/>
fragile truth.<br/>
<br/>
The first clause of any Letterboxing constitution must be that the right<br/>
to pursue our happy hobby should be guarded and husbanded with care.<br/>
<br/>
Dartmoor, we are grateful that you have opened your wilderness to us<br/>
again, and at last. We will never again take your dark mysterious moors<br/>
and wild craggy tors for granted.<br/>
<br/>
I for one have felt the loss of your magic remedies for the stress and<br/>
strains of 21st century living and will be with you again soon to repay my<br/>
tribute to your generosity and openness of spirit.<br/>
<br/>
To all Letterboxers of America and to my many friends in the USA, I am<br/>
pleased to let you know that Dartmoor is once again open, and repeat my<br/>
regular invitation.  Do come and visit sometime.  You are very welcome.<br/>
<br/>
I will be pleased to join you if I am able and introduce you our wild and<br/>
beautiful moors.  It has been a joy to share our wonderful news with like<br/>
spirits and good people.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes to LbNA and all its members. I hope that this summer everyone<br/>
gets a huge F score and lots fun and enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
At last we in Britain can re-start our part of this global hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Fond wishes and happy boxing.<br/>
<br/>
