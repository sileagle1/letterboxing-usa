If the weather is nice there may be a lot of visitors in the park, so please be discrete in your search. <br/>
As with all urban letterboxes, the continued secrecy of the box's location depends on your sneaky <br/>
instincts and street smarts. When the trees leaf out in a few weeks, the hiding place will seem more <br/>
secluded and you'll be able stamp the book without fear of anyone spotting you, but in the mean time, <br/>
be careful.<br/>

Magic Hedge Letterbox<br/>
Chicago, Cook County, Illinois<br/>
<br/>
The Magic Hedge is a brushy and wooded area on the tip of a peninsula jutting out into Lake Michigan <br/>
at the end of Montrose Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. The letterbox is hidden in the center of the Magic <br/>
Hedge.<br/>
<br/>
Look for park signs directing you to the Magic Hedge from the harbor road at the end of Montrose <br/>
Avenue. Upon entering the Hedge, follow the path to the center. Four major paths meet on the eastern <br/>
side of a small meadow at the center of the Hedge. From this junction, look for three separate <br/>
thickets of cherry trees to the east/southeast. Duck down and enter the middle (nearest) of these. At <br/>
the center of the thicket you will find an old cherry tree with weathered, peeling bark. Push aside the <br/>
twigs and leaves at the base of the cherry tree to find the letterbox.<br/>

My understanding is that this hedge is "magic" because it attracts <br/>
thousands of migratory birds every spring, a "migrant trap" in <br/>
birdwatching lingo. It's on my short list of birding destinations for <br/>
the future. Now I have another reason for that trip to Chicago. Funhog<br/>

Hurrah!  <br/>
I will be in Chicago on the 17th and I was wondering what I was going <br/>
to do for a couple of hours before I have to meet my friends!  Now I <br/>
will be able to add another stamp to my log book.<br/>
