more than the state next door.  Little did I know it was a little state full<br/>
of great places to hike with an interesting past.  Dan and I love all of the<br/>
boxes we've been to.  The stamps and stories are all fantastic, and we look<br/>
forward to each new adventure you send us on.  We couldn't believe when we<br/>
went to Rome Point and actually saw seals laying on the rocks!<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait for more RI boxes.  Keep up the great work!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to all for enjoying our RI letterboxes and sending in your <br/>
kind words. It was fun working with Trish on some of these boxes, and <br/>
now it seems I should discuss doing some more with her help. She gets <br/>
credit for the stamp carving, I haven't made that attempt yet, and <br/>
let's not forget the help on the Mercy hitch hiker from our friends <br/>
in Virginia, Ladybug, Katybug, and Boop. While we've been working on <br/>
these boxes over the last month, some of you have been busy in Ct. I <br/>
look forward to getting out and extending the area of the <br/>
Narragansett Trail I've done by doing the Yawbux Valley. It is my <br/>
intention in the future to lead RI AMC'ers over the Narragansett <br/>
Trail over two weekends and this is a great way for me to discover <br/>
it. How many boxes do we have on that trail now?<br/>
Anyway, from Little Rhody, thanks, and look forward to more.<br/>

Bob, Eric and I were talking about just that at the last Gathering. <br/>
Working your way, I can think of Tribal Nation (2), Little Dam (4), <br/>
Yabux Valley (3), Narragansett Ledges (3), Ledge Woods (1 with clues <br/>
not online and available only at the Waterford EMS), a certain <br/>
unnamed mystery box (1), Green Falls Pond (1), Narragansett White <br/>
Rock (1), and Conanchet's Waters (2). That's 19! Are there a couple <br/>
others I'm missing? Sounds like a fun trip. Where would you camp <br/>
over? Bob, does anyone ever do Rhode Island's North-South trail? It's <br/>
a, what, 60 mile link of trails going up the "whole" state. Eric, by <br/>
the way, is friends with the trail manager for the Narragansett in <br/>
Connecticut. Maybe he knows more as well. I know they had a <br/>
successful maintanence event during last year's Trails Day <br/>
festivities.<br/>

You can actually do the whole trail in one day if you are a decent <br/>
hiker.  We used to do it every fall and my husband still does it once <br/>
or twice per year.  On a perfect fall day it can be a sublime <br/>
experience (sublimely painful if you don't have good shoes).  I think <br/>
that stamping into 20 boxes could slow you down quite a bit, <br/>
however...<br/>
