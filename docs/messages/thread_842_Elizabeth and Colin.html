&gt; Hello again (we emailed a couple of weeks ago) and welcome to the <br/>
&gt; mailing list! Yes, your mail to LBNA goes to about 100 <br/>
&gt; interested/interesting folks who like to rummage around in the <br/>
&gt; outdoors for hidden treasures. We've only met Tom from VT so far, and <br/>
&gt; he, at least, is DEFINATELY a character!<br/>
<br/>
Of course. Thank you, Jay. Like Merlin and Frodo and Sherlock and all <br/>
our other favorite characters. I know you didn't mean to suggest that <br/>
there was anything even the least bit odd about us - just <br/>
interesting, as you say.<br/>
<br/>
I also would recommend the Fond Farewell boxes in Newport. The bird <br/>
sanctuary is a beautiful spot, with lots of nice surf around it. <br/>
Compass requirements are fairly minimal.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you can make it to the May gathering. Welcome to the list, in <br/>
any case.<br/>

For your son on the Newport trip, we recommend the "Fond Farewell" <br/>
boxes at the Norman Bird Sanctuary. There is some compassing for <br/>
them, but it's really straightforward and kids, especially young <br/>
boys, love the ridge line hiking. That whole nautical thing on <br/>
the "Land Sailing" box is just fluff and creative writing: the <br/>
directions are really meant to be pretty easy to follow. It is a <br/>
fairly long walk for younger kids, but we actually placed the box on <br/>
bicycles and our 4 young ones loved it.<br/>
<br/>
The "Gathering" weekend is May 13 - 14, at Rocky Neck State Park in <br/>
East Lyme. We've also got a couple of people coming who may bed and <br/>
breakfast it at a close by inn instead of camp. We'll enjoy the <br/>
weekend meeting each other, hiking, exchanging stamps, and having a <br/>
great time. My 8 year old son Ned would LOVE it if Colin came! Please <br/>
do! Our email is drewclan @ aol.com, or, you can call us at (860)739-<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for your encouraging words and welcome to the list!<br/>
