<br/>
It's happened, folks. I've got a story that might<br/>
qualify for the Letterboxing Purple Heart.<br/>
<br/>
We recently put our first mystery letterbox into the<br/>
world. About two weeks ago, a local boxer, new to the<br/>
sport, contacted us. Turns out he was about eight<br/>
years old. He asked me a few questions about our<br/>
boxes, and eventually I ended up trading emails with<br/>
his mother as well. They had managed to figure out<br/>
where the box generally was hidden, and were going to<br/>
go get it. I took this as a great opportunity to meet<br/>
and get soem exchanges, as well as watch the first<br/>
person stamp into the Rose.<br/>
<br/>
So, last Monday night, we meet at the location, and<br/>
they find the box fairly quickly. We stamp each others<br/>
books, etc. I graciously offer to rehide it for them,<br/>
while we're finishing up.<br/>
<br/>
Silly me.<br/>
<br/>
I go back to the hidey spot, overturn the rock which<br/>
is it's home, and a spider of some unknown brown<br/>
variety runs over the rock and onto my hand.<br/>
Reflexively, I swat at it, and missed. The spider<br/>
didn't. It bit me.<br/>
<br/>
At first, it was like a bee sting. A little red and<br/>
itchy, but no big deal. We went home, I cleaned it up,<br/>
and went to bed. <br/>
<br/>
The next morning, it had swollen considerably. And it<br/>
continued to do so for the next day, eventually<br/>
becoming so large that I couldn't flex my fingers. Off<br/>
to the doctors we go, who gave me Advil and Benadryl,<br/>
and tell me to call if it doesn't go down by Friday.<br/>
<br/>
Well, today is Friday, and the swelling is finally<br/>
gone. So we went boxing in the rain today in Hartford,<br/>
CT. I'll tell that story in another post.<br/>
<br/>
So, folks, do I qualify? Not as cool as falling of a<br/>
cliff, admittedly, or getting stuck in freezing mud,<br/>
but I'll let y'all be the judge. :-)<br/>

I have the Purple Heart box and was waiting for Pandora to move into her new <br/>
digs before I sent it to her (per her broken foot adventure), but I haven't <br/>
heard any news of whether she was settled in a new place or not (i.e. has an <br/>
address I could send the box to).<br/>
<br/>
Yoo Hoo!<br/>
Pandora! Let me know (perhaps Sir Balthazar has heard news?) where you are so <br/>
we can get this box moving again :-)<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>

Thanks for waiting. I shall try not to earn this myself. <br/>

BTW, JugglerMouse and I have been inspired by Pandy's work in the <br/>
Atkins diet. Together we have lost almost one Green Turtle weight. No <br/>
kidding. I have lost 8 inches in my waist, and still trending <br/>
downward, since May 11th. I will let Pandy and JM brag on their own <br/>
progress. Although this is a tad off topic, letterboxing is so much <br/>
more fun when I don't have to lug an extra 30 lbs up the hills. Maybe <br/>
I will get more of Ryan's boxes!<br/>

Does a list of all previous recipients, and why they<br/>
