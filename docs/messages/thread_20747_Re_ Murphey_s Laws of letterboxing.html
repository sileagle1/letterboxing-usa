For me it happens when  my husband (rarely, due to below stated <br/>
reasons) accompanies me on a letterbox search. He does not letterbox <br/>
and thinks it is all rather silly, but recognizes it is my personal <br/>
mental and physical health plan. when a box is found, he gets <br/>
(quietly) impatient so I turn the whole thing into a rushed game of <br/>
sorts..time me-bet I'm done stamping in less than 3 minutes!! How <br/>
relaxing is that?? Anyways, invariably when the husband is along, the <br/>
box cannot be found. That drives HIM nuts. you know that old <br/>
stereotype about men and directions. Well, hate to break it to you <br/>
all but it is true. They (he) won't ask for them, but gosh darn, if <br/>
directions are there in hand they had BETTER be right!! Ah well, <br/>
we've been married  for 20 years. This blindness to the joys of <br/>
letterboxing will be forgiven (at least for now).<br/>
  Hmm..I wonder where Silvereagle boxes?? Lovers clenched in <br/>
eachother's arms-must be Virginia ;-)<br/>

any ego thing but it seems everyone I run into to ask directions is just <br/>
visiting from an adjoining galaxy.  One day I took my wife letterboxing to try to <br/>
get her interested and we couldn't find a feature in a park that supposed to be <br/>
easily recognizable. I got so frustrated that I asked directions. The person I <br/>
asked was right on the money. Now everytime we are lost I must ask directions <br/>
or face my wife's indignation. <br/>
