before, I'm wondering what kind of events are usually planned...<br/>
I checked with MommaFox to see if there might be any demos at the May <br/>
Gathering at Quoddick on Stamp Carving.  She said not that she knew <br/>
of.  <br/>
So, my question is, would it be possible for any of the experienced <br/>
stamp carvers out there to bring along some examples of their tools <br/>
and media that they use?  Also to show the techniques of transferring <br/>
images (acetone, xylene, tracing, etc).  The various website articles <br/>
are very useful, but to see it all first-hand in "real life" would be <br/>
so much more helpful...just an informal demo would be greatly <br/>
appreciated.<br/>
Many thanks...Sue<br/>
