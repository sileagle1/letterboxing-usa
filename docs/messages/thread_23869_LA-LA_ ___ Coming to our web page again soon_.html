Well, it's getting on that time of year for us to start thinking <br/>
about who is on our "short list" for getting the "Lifetime <br/>
Achievement Letterbox Award" this year!  For those who don't know, <br/>
this is just our own little annual tradition started last October as <br/>
a way of honoring those folks we feel have gone way above and beyond <br/>
the "norm" in establishing and promoting letterboxing in North <br/>
America.  The basic criteria that we set up for people to be <br/>
eligible for this "Lil' Oscar" letterbox include a well-intentioned <br/>
letterboxing disposition, 100 or more traditionally planted boxes, a <br/>
combined PFX of at least 500, and a minimum of 5 yearsof "longevity" <br/>
in North American letterboxing.  In this manner we hope to honor our <br/>
personal "letterboxing heroes" chronologically as our hobby has <br/>
developed here on this continent over the past few years.<br/>
<br/>
This year, therefore,  we will be focusing on a few special people <br/>
who made their way into letterboxing during 2001 or before, and who <br/>
have, in our opinions, accomplished some pretty remarkable things!  <br/>
We hope to get around to writing up this year's "LA-LA report" (and <br/>
possibly a few other long overdue ones, too) in a couple of weeks, <br/>
after we get back from a short trip to Texas.  We'll post when the <br/>
report's ready and hopefully there'll be a few surprises!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Wanda and Pete<br/>
