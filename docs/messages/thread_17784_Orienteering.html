I just wanted to share my fun experience at an orienteering meet I <br/>
attended on Sunday with my kids. I thought that there might be an <br/>
overlap of interests between letterboxers who like to run around in <br/>
the woods with compasses, so I figured I would do my little part to <br/>
raise awareness. I'm lucky in that the Washington DC area is home to <br/>
some of the most active orienteering clubs in the country, so <br/>
there's a meet or two going on almost every weekend! I'm also lucky <br/>
in that one of the gals in my running club is also an "avid" (cough <br/>
cough) orienteerer. Avid indeed--in her glory days she was 5-time <br/>
U.S. national women's champion and had a spot on the national team <br/>
for something like 14 years in a row. <br/>
<br/>
The sport is a little like chess or checkers, in that there are only <br/>
a few simple rules, but you can compete at MANY different levels of <br/>
skill and difficulty. Most orienteering meets will have several <br/>
courses laid out of varying lengths and degrees of difficulty. The <br/>
easiest courses are usually 1-1.5 miles in length, with all the <br/>
checkpoints laid out on clearly marked trails. The hardest courses <br/>
may be 3-5 miles, with the control points placed in the middle of <br/>
indistinct briar patches. Beginners, families, and just plain slow <br/>
and methodical folks can hike the courses, but the competitive folks <br/>
run them for time. The rough location of each checkpoint is marked <br/>
on really neat maps; if you like cool maps and want to know all the <br/>
hidden ins and outs of the parks you've been hiking for years, <br/>
it's "worth the price of admission" just to get one. It's also fun <br/>
to watch the advanced orienteerers running breakneck through the <br/>
underbrush with their eyes on the prize. Kinda like that "my husband <br/>
was raised by wolves" car commercial. <br/>
<br/>
If you're interested, you can learn more and find clubs in your area <br/>
at www.us.orienteering.org. If you're in MD/DC/VA area and would <br/>
like to meet up at a meet this spring, drop me an e-mail at <br/>
drlith@hotmail.com. I don't know what I'm doing, either, but I know <br/>
it's sometimes easier to try something new if you know at least one <br/>
soul who will be there!<br/>
