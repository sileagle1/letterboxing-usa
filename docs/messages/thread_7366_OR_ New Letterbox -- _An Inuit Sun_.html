<br/>
Location:  Audobon Trails near Upper Macleay Park, Portland, OR<br/>
Dropped:  August 8, 2002 by A.Rose<br/>
Path:  Dirt and hills.  I saw a couple with two little kids (one in a <br/>
stroller) braving the trails.  I can't imagine!<br/>
Est. Distance:  Not certain.  The outside perimeter is maybe 1 1/2 to 2 mile <br/>
loop?<br/>
<br/>
(If you find any problems with this box or wish to share any successes, etc., <br/>
please email Annette at ARoseLb@aol.com.)<br/>
<br/>
Directions to the trailhead:   The Audobon House is located in the Southern <br/>
part of Forest Park.  From the intersection of W Burnside and NW 23rd, head <br/>
North on NW 23rd.  Turn left on Lovejoy which then automatically becomes <br/>
Cornell.  Upper Macleay park is on the right and the Audubon House is just <br/>
west of there.<br/>
<br/>
Clue:  Near the place where the Creek, Woodpecker and Jay Trails seem to <br/>
meet.  Find a large gnarled tree with many roots and a hole through its <br/>
trunk.  Search along its roots, for a place covered with bark.  <br/>
