<div>Yesterday, I searched for and could 
not find "The Elephant of Watertown" (NY) Letterbox. The clues to the box 
were relatively clear. Though it was recently placed, I am afraid it might 
be missing. Has the Owner checked it lately or has anyone found it in the 
last few days?</div>

letterbox today and also did not find it.  I'm pretty sure we were in<br/>
the right place, and found lots of nice hidey-holes where a tupperware<br/>
could be tucked, but no letterbox...  We were fairly thorough, but<br/>
there's always the possibility that it was hidden extra-well.<br/>
