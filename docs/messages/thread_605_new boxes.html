 I think this is really incredible! I hope Letterboxing continues to grow,<br/>
and becomes a National pastime!<br/>
 I am in the process of making up a flyer to put on the bulletin boards of<br/>
all my local Libraries. I would also like to find a way to get the info<br/>
about Letterboxing to all the local Scouting groups too. I noticed that most<br/>
of the boxes I've found were visited by Boy Scout groups and I feel this is<br/>
a great way for kids to get out and explore! Any suggestions?<br/>

<br/>                      
The GREAT TREE HIKE
<br/>Orange is the fashion color in season.
<br/>This hike is in the Tyler Mill Open Space Area,  on the other
side of the Muddy River from the <i>Morris Rock Vista Hike </i>. On this
hike there are many lovely GREAT TREES, It is a hike for all seasons. Spring
finds the land painted creamy white with Dutchman's Britches and other
wildflowers. Summer finds the hawks soaring with children's kites. Bikers
and horses also use the trails. Winter snows bring out the snowshoes and
cross country skis.
<br/>Begin the hike by walking west on the paved road and notice the first
GREAT TREES are the sugar maples on your right. Off on the left is the
Muddy River that bisects the Tyler Mill Open Space.
<br/>Soon a trap rock ridge becomes evident on your right.. Watch for a
heap of pavement on the right opposite a small cleared parking space. This
is the start of the blue trail and a blue blaze is faintly showing on a
hunk of pavement in the pile. Turn right into the woods and begin a gentle
climb into a hemlock grove. Cross over an unmarked path and continue on
the blue trail, dipping down and coming to a 'Y' intersection with a red
trail. There is a  GREAT three sister OAK TREE at the intersection
on your right. Turn left continuing on the blue trail that has now joined
up with the red. Proceed up hill twisting and turning through a Cedar grove
coming out of the grove as the Red trail meets another trail going right
into a field. At this intersection, turn back into the woods going left
uphill on the red blazed trail. Soon two more GREAT TREES come into view.
Notice the GREAT BEECH TREE on your left and the GREAT sugar MAPLE TREE
on your right. The best is yet to come !! Climb a short steep hill traveled
by many bikers, and at the top pass by an unmarked trail on your right
.  Now notice several GREAT TREES on your left, but the GREAT WOLF
BEECH TREE on the left is the one to find. Take time to look at this 'living'
Totem Pole and think of all it has seen. According to the Park Nature Book,
the many 'babies' around this Wolf tree have not grown from seeds, but
are true clones coming up from the GREAT Tree's  roots. Stand with
your back to the Wolf Tree and take a reading of 320 degrees. Follow that
about 10 feet off trail to a Cedar tree. the GREAT WOLF TREE letterbox
treasure is there. Stamp in and carefully seal and hide again.
<br/>Return back to the Red trail and retrace back about 50 feet to the
unmarked trail now on your left. It is well traveled and goes up in a NE
direction , soon going steeply down. At the bottom of the hill watch carefully
and turn right [east] onto an unmarked trail --just <u>before</u> a white
blazed trail.  On this unmarked trail notice a field is on your left.
Soon the trail crossed over a stone wall and now take notice of the trap
rock hill on your right. The trail curves right and then crosses the stone
wall again. go right about six big steps along the wall and find the Trap
Rock Hill Letterbox in a rock hole along the side of the wall covered by
a rock with a "handle" Stamp in and place the box carefully back. Continue
up hill through the woods and meet up with the Red trail again. Turn left,
east, and soon notice your old friends the GREAT TREES , now on opposite
sides of the trail !! When the Red trail meets the junction at the field,
turn left now out into the open field. Enjoy the views of the soccer fields
below and a great place to fly kites. Look for the Go Fly A Kite Letter
box by walking left into the field and left along the woods about 22 paces
to large quartz rock. The Treasure is south of the bolder at the feet of
a GREAT PINE TREE . Stamp in and carefully return the box to it's hiding
place. Return to the Red/Blue Trail and proceed down through the Cedar
grove to the intersection where the GREAT three Sister OAK TREE stands
and turn right, south onto the blue trail and back to the park road then
left to your car. I hope you have enjoyed the GREAT TREES of Tyler Mill.</p></body></html>

    a white blazed trail.  On this unmarked trail notice a field is on your 
    left. Soon the trail crossed over a stone wall and now take notice of the 
    trap rock hill on your right. The trail curves right and then crosses the 
    stone wall again. go right about six big steps along the wall and find the 
    Trap Rock Hill Letterbox in a rock hole along the side of the wall covered 
    by a rock with a "handle" Stamp in and place the box carefully back. 
    Continue up hill through the woods and meet up with the Red trail again. 
    Turn left, east, and soon notice your old friends the GREAT TREES , now on 
    opposite sides of the trail !! When the Red trail meets the junction at the 
    field, turn left now out into the open field. Enjoy the views of the soccer 
    fields below and a great place to fly kites. Look for the Go Fly A Kite 
    Letter box by walking left into the field and left along the woods about 22 
    paces to large quartz rock. The Treasure is south of the bolder at the feet 
    of a GREAT PINE TREE . Stamp in and carefully return the box to it's hiding 
    place. Return to the Red/Blue Trail and proceed down through the Cedar grove 
    to the intersection where the GREAT three Sister OAK TREE stands and turn 
    right, south onto the blue trail and back to the park road then left to your 
    car. I hope you have enjoyed the GREAT TREES of Tyler Mill. <br/><br/><tt>To

Veteran  Memorial soccer field, turn right onto<u> Northford Rd.</u> '  In
both north and south directions I typed the wrong road. Can the North Branford
Rd [ wromg ]  be changed to <u>Northford  Rd.</u> ?? I sure hope so !!!<br/>
