When I went with him to plant it, he decided to show me where the original box had been. I said, "Are you SURE it's missing? I see a tiny bit of burlap sticking out."<br/>

Turns out, someone had found it and taken it and then must have realized they weren't supposed to and returned it...no note apologizing though.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">And sometimes people boxing with their children get lazy and send their<br/>
children to replace the box.  They'll all move away from the box to stamp in<br/>
and manage to keep everything they're doing a secret, but then, after<br/>
they've done so well, at the very end, it's "Bobby, dear, could you run back<br/>
and put this box back where we found it now?  Remember, put it back EXACTLY<br/>
how we found it.  Do you remember how we found it?"  Bobby nods.  "Good boy!<br/>
Put it back just how we found it!"  And Bobby, being all of maybe 7 or 8<br/>
years old, has absolutely no idea how they originally found the box but he<br/>
dutifully runs back and replaces the box.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes non-boxers find it and have no idea just what the<br/>
game/sport/hobby is all about, so don't even realize that it's supposed to<br/>
be hidden in a *particular* spot.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes newbies don't really grasp the idea of how important it is to<br/>
replace it in the exact spot the placer originally intended until after<br/>
they've found a few boxes (or maybe *not* found a box or two) and then<br/>
suddenly the lightbulb goes on.<br/>
<br/>
Or a wild animal or stray dog may have been playing with it and dragged it<br/>
to another location.<br/>
<br/>
And unless you live at the hiding spot, you may only *think* you know what<br/>
goes on around there and may only *think* they're hidden well enough that<br/>
nobody would find them who wasn't intentionally looking for letterboxes.  A<br/>
heavy rain could have come down and washed the box out of it's hiding place,<br/>
animals could live almost right on top of that spot, it could be a popular<br/>
area for teens, who, when they get bored, could go poking around.<br/>
<br/>
The possibilities are endless.  I always figure, if it's missing once, I<br/>
replace it.  If it's missing twice, I just go ahead and find a new hiding<br/>
spot alltogether.<br/>

&gt; It happens, I can attest to it. I found a cache<br/>
&gt; right<br/>
&gt; in the middle of a trail about 50 meters from where<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; should be. It had a couple of hockey cards and a<br/>
&gt; signature card under the cache (the cards were still<br/>
&gt; in good shape, not weather damaged). With the coords<br/>
&gt; and the cache hint I took it to the spot it<br/>
&gt; should've<br/>
&gt; been in. The last 2 people to sign the log were<br/>
&gt; muggles but they really liked the find. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Turns out that the cache had gone missing for a<br/>
&gt; while<br/>
&gt; so the cache owner had replaced it. So now there<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; 2 caches. He went out to retrieve the extra cache.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe the muggles forgot where it was hidden and<br/>
&gt; thought that by leaving it in the middle of the<br/>
&gt; trail <br/>
&gt; a geocacher would come by and get it to its proper<br/>
&gt; spot. When I put it back I didn't see the<br/>
&gt; replacement<br/>
&gt; cache so even I didn't get it quite right.<br/>

&gt; I have heard stories of muggles finding geocaches<br/>
&gt; and,<br/>
&gt; not knowing what they were, took them home.  After<br/>
&gt; investigating further, they would return the cache<br/>
&gt; with a note apologizing for the misunderstanding<br/>
&gt; and,<br/>
&gt; sometimes, a new screen name log signature as they<br/>
&gt; were inspired to sign on as a geocacher.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course, being newbies, they don't always re-hide<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; in the exact same spot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ya never know.  It may have happened with your LB's!<br/>

&gt; I have had 2 boxes gone "missing" this year. Finders<br/>
&gt; looked all over and couldn't find them <br/>
&gt; and I looked all over and couldn't find them. Then,<br/>
&gt; miraculously, they turn up! Both were <br/>
&gt; hidden in completely different areas, several yards<br/>
&gt; from where they should have been hidden. <br/>
&gt; I only found them because they were so badly hidden<br/>
&gt; that other people found them and <br/>
&gt; emailed me. I can't imagine letterboxers would do<br/>
&gt; this...randomly rehide boxes. Do you think <br/>
&gt; it is people who find them accidentally who have no<br/>
&gt; idea about letterboxing? Kids?<br/>
&gt; geocachers? I am flummoxed because both were very<br/>
&gt; well<br/>
&gt; hidden and one would have to be <br/>
&gt; looking for them to find them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thankfully I have two boxes alive and kicking that I<br/>
&gt; thought had been lost!<br/>

I've never been crazy about this one.   Sounds too much like "noxious."   And <br/>
while some of them may very well be that, surely there are others who can be <br/>
saved and perhaps even converted to our side of the Force!<br/>
