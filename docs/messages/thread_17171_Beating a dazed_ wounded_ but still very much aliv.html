I am being forced to re-raise the question and expand it a bit.<br/>
<br/>
It is only dead horses that we cannot beat?  And how are we defining <br/>
dead?  If I wander across a lemur that is obviously beyond help or <br/>
say a suicidal lemur with a degenerative disease is that close <br/>
enough to dead that I can beat it?<br/>
<br/>
Or does it actually have to be dead?  Do I need a copy of the <br/>
coroner's report before I commence with the beating?  How long can <br/>
the beating last?  Can I use my choice of weapons?  May I videotape <br/>
the beating and then sell it to the Fox network?<br/>

Sorry for all of the questions but I really like letterboxing and <br/>

Absolutely, and I should protest yourself from being booted, too.  Anyone <br/>
demonstrating the breeding and fine sensibilities necessary to contemplate the <br/>
proper procedure and technique for beating a dead lemur and ascertaining the <br/>
lemur's conditional fitness for beating is a person I should count myself greatly <br/>
honored to enjoy a distant connection to.  This inspires me to do a beating <br/>
the dead lemur box in NOVA.  Just the thing to place this weekend.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for the kind words.  I come from a long line of smart-<br/>
asses and dead-lemur beaters.  When my great-great-grandfather <br/>
jumped his Harley over the Indian Ocean in 1043 BC he brought the <br/>
first dead-lemur beating apparatus to America.  (patent still <br/>
pending)  There is a statue erected in his honor at the "Park of Non-<br/>
Existent Made-Up People" in Sinkingslowlyville.  You should check it <br/>
out if you ever slowly get sucked into the town.<br/>
