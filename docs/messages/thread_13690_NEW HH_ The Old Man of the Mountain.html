On 6/20/2003, a new HH will be released into the<br/>
world, dedicated to the memory of the Old Man of the<br/>
Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The Old Man of the Mountain, nicknamed the Great Stone<br/>
Face, was located in Franconia Notch State Park, New<br/>
Hampshire. The Old Man of the Mountain was scenically<br/>
set 1,200' above Profile Lake.<br/>
<br/>
Before his collapse, The Old Man of the Mountain could<br/>
be viewed year-round from two different viewing areas<br/>
on I-93 in Franconia Notch State Park. On the<br/>
northbound side of the highway there is a pull-off and<br/>
on the southbound side take Exit 34B and follow signs.<br/>
<br/>
On Saturday, May 3, 2003 at approximately 7:30 a.m.,<br/>
two Franconia Notch State Park employees noticed that<br/>
the Old Man of the Mountain was gone. The last people<br/>
known to see him were a troop of Girl Scouts the<br/>
evening before. Sometime in the night, New Hampshire<br/>
lost it's most visible and enduring symbol.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you around the country that never saw<br/>
him, you have truly missed out on seeing on of our<br/>
country's natural wonders. This stamp is being<br/>
released as a HH, rather than a regular box as<br/>
originally planned, in honor of him and his memory. To<br/>
many people in New England, and northern New England<br/>
in particular, news of his loss hit as if we'd lost an<br/>
old friend. Photos and more information are available<br/>
at the following web site.<br/>

<br/>
Daniel Webster once said: "Men hang out their signs<br/>
indicative of their respective trades; shoemakers hang<br/>
out a gigantic shoe; jewelers a monster watch, and the<br/>
dentist hangs out a gold tooth; but in the mountains<br/>
of New Hampshire, God Almighty has hung out a sign to<br/>
show that there, He makes men."<br/>
<br/>
Long Live the Old Man of the Mountain!<br/>

I actually visited it today.  I need to go back and drop off a new notebook.<br/>

Glad to see that it will be getting a new book. We<br/>
live way too far away to service it, and the book was<br/>
full when we were there last month.<br/>
