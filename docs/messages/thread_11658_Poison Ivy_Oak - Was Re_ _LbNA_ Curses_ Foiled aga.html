Try using TECHNU for washing yourself and your clothes (remember to use COLD water on your skin! Warm water will just open your pores and let it all in).<br/>

When it is growing in vine form it has profuse orangey brown rootlets. I always tell kids, if you see a vine that "needs a shave" don't touch it. And if it has white berries, don't touch it! Poison ivy and poison sumac both have whitish greenish berries.<br/>

    I'll print this out and keep it in the laundry room. I make <br/>
everyone strip after a hike and dump all clothes/shoes into washing <br/>
machine right away. (Here is where you can imagine naked family <br/>
scurrying through house.) Never thought about it during winter <br/>
though. <br/>
