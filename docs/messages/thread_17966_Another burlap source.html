camouflage I buy out Wal-Mart's burlap supplies when the hunting <br/>
stuff goes on sale.  Now's a good time to check as they convert the <br/>
sporting goods section to summer sports (i.e. fishing).  You can get <br/>
a piece about 14' long by 10' wide (camo on one side, brown on the <br/>
other) for about $4.   Don't buy it until they "red tag" it.....which <br/>
happens every spring like clockwork. 50% off is always better than <br/>
full price : )<br/>
