&gt; Hi Matt,<br/>
&gt; I tried numerous times to find your letterbox at<br/>
&gt; Starved Rock.  Either your clues are super hard and<br/>
&gt; mine are way to easy.  Or I'm just to new at this, and<br/>
&gt; are just having a hard time figuring this one out.  I<br/>
&gt; don't know what the 110 down is refering to.  Is it a<br/>
&gt; number or numbers to physically look for?  Is it<br/>
&gt; steps,<br/>
&gt; paces?  There is not much to your clue.  Can you give<br/>
&gt; me more information.  I have already had two cases of<br/>
&gt; Poison Ivy over the past 3 weeks looking for this box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the poison ivy! <br/>
<br/>
You're right, the clues are a bit vague. Here's a re-written version which =<br/>
may be easier to follow.<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
Starved Rock Buffet Letterbox<br/>
I&amp;M Canal Series<br/>
LaSalle County, nearest town: Utica, Illinois<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Starved Rock gets its name from a battle in the 1760s in which a band of Il=<br/>
liniwek Indians took <br/>
refuge on the top of this rocky battlement. They were surrounded and besieg=<br/>
ed by the Ottawa and <br/>
Potawatomi, who defeated them by starving them to death on the outcrop.<br/>
<br/>
In honor of this terrible battle, every Sunday a sumptuous buffet is held i=<br/>
n the grand Starved Rock  <br/>
Lodge, atop the cliff just opposite the rocky knob. The meal is very popula=<br/>
r, especially in summer  <br/>
months, and you may be wise to make reservations before your visit.<br/>
<br/>
After stuffing yourself with all the waffles, potatoes, fried chicken, frui=<br/>
t and omelets you can eat,  <br/>
recovering by the majestic fireplace in the lodge hall, and making the pilg=<br/>
rimage to the top of Starved  <br/>
Rock, you are now ready to find the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Though there are many paths in the park, follow the Trail of the Whispering=<br/>
 Giant. <br/>
Listen only to Chief Walks With the Wind. If you lean close, he will whispe=<br/>
r to you:<br/>
110 down and a little bit up, follow a rabbit's trail back to his home und=<br/>
er a tree.<br/>
