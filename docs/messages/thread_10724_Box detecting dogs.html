<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi Shelia,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for your very nice description of training dogs.  I really<br/>
&gt; enjoy working with animals and always appreciate getting new ideas<br/>
&gt; for working with my dogs.  Although I have never trained for SAR I<br/>
&gt; have been training dogs that I own for about 12 years.  when I said I<br/>
&gt; could probably teach my dog in an afternoon I was not trying to play<br/>
&gt; down the amount of time it takes to train a dog.  I am talking about<br/>
&gt; a 12 yr old AKC utility dog who has been being trained literally<br/>
&gt; since she was 8 weeks old.  She &amp; I literaly have thousands of hours<br/>
&gt; training together not to mention competing together too.  She also<br/>
&gt; knows agility &amp; has done some field work.  I saw this as an extension<br/>
&gt; of many of the behaviors she already knows.  Although she is old she<br/>
&gt; still has a tremendous amount of drive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I thought that teaching my younger dogs to find letterboxes might be<br/>
&gt; an interesting project. They are way less trained than my older dog.<br/>
&gt; I just haven't put the hours into them that I did with Katie.  A lot<br/>
&gt; of the techniques you describe we use for teaching young dogs to<br/>
&gt; retrieve birds.  I am going to print out your message.  I will let<br/>
&gt; you know how I make out with my project.<br/>

<div>Max isn't trained to find boxes, and sometimes has little interest in doing 
so except for the hike, but he has helped us find boxes before.  Most 
recently at Pink Trotter's Favorite Musicals Max found lots of them!  A few 
times I passed by the location, but Max wouldn't come, instead he sniffed around 
a rock wall or base of the tree.  When I went to see what he was up to, 
there was the box!  I think it helped a lot that the series had been 
frequented by lots of boxers not long before we were there, so it was more like 
he was sniffing out people than the boxes.</div>
