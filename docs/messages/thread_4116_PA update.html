I noticed on my special page for PA (Muk-Luk) that a correction was not<br/>
made.  I was wondering if this could be taken care of so that there will<br/>
not be any confusion.  I had to replant one letterbox because the<br/>
original was swept away with the creek.  It is listed under the Nov. 8,<br/>
01 whats new and is also message #8685.  It is the Scholfield Ford<br/>
Covered Bridge at Tyler State Park.  Thanks for your help.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We went boxing in PA on Wednesday. Here's what we found.<br/>
<br/>
Peace in the Valley - Box in great shape. Beautiful location.<br/>
<br/>
Sunrise Trek - The stamp is cracked in two, but it's still stampable. <br/>
<br/>
Flight of the Hawk - Box in great shape.<br/>
<br/>
The Mighty Oak - We tried for this one even though the clues stated <br/>
it was MIA. We can report that it's still MIA. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Had a fun day and the nature center is great. Another beautiful spot, <br/>
only about an hour from us, that I never knew existed. If it weren't <br/>
for letterboxing, I would have never known about it. <br/>

P2F21X0HH1V6D3  D=Deer. I've decided to keep track of them. One <br/>
crossed the path a few feet in front of us the other day, and it <br/>
stopped for a minute or two to stare at us before leaving. Very <br/>
cool. :)<br/>
