Hi Lori,<br/>
   WE just had a fieldtrip in which I laid out temporary letterboxes and <br/>
geocaches which had to be removed afterwards.  It was on a kid level and the <br/>
clues ranged from deciphering tottle rocks, following simple left &amp; right <br/>
face directions, learning to use a compass, following simple compass <br/>
directions then all the way up to map reading with the compass and then using <br/>
a GPS to find a series of boxes.  <br/>
  I went to an orienteering site on line and found some very good examples of <br/>
orienteering courses.  I used the control point markers along with the clues <br/>
and had the boxers stamp in at each control point.   It worked best for me to <br/>
find the hiding place  first and then lay out the clues.  Hope this helped.<br/>

 Hi,<br/>
 I'm new to letterboxing, but am having a wonderful time researching <br/>
 it.  I am planning a weekend retreat for a group of rubberstampers at <br/>
 a camp in Michigan, and thought it would be great fun to have <br/>
 letterboxing as one of the things to do.  I need some help figuring <br/>
 out exactly where to start.  We are going out to the camp to check <br/>
 out the grounds, and then I guess the next step is planning the clues <br/>
 and maps.  Any ideas and or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. <br/>
 The sad part is that the camp is on private property, so the boxes <br/>
 must be removed at the end of the retreat, however, maybe it will <br/>
 spark an interest in some of the local letterbox "sites" in our area!<br/>
 Again, thanks for any information you can offer.<br/>
<br/>
