&gt;  ... you can also search for virtual boxes by searching the clues/content.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Sounds like a lot of work to me.<br/>
<br/>
Since I cannot see your tone, I am guessing you are joking, right?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  In this day and age shouldn't gratification be just a mouse click away?<br/>
<br/>
Assuming the same, I believe it is!<br/>
<br/>
If you are not joking, please excuse my assumption.  For those who don't know about the <br/>
"search" function at LBNA, you can put word(s) into the search-in-clues area to bring up <br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
<br/>
I am uncomfortable looking for boxes where "hungry bears" might be found.  I'll type in <br/>
"hungry bears."  If a box is listed, I read the clues.  If I don't want to find this box, I will set <br/>
the box status to ignore.  I could add "poisonous snakes, water mocassins, scorpions, etc."  <br/>
to my list of boxes to skip.  Nothing personal to the planters, but in a strange area, I don't <br/>
want to go missing or have little time to get medical attention.<br/>
<br/>
I still have more boxes than I'll ever be able to find.<br/>
