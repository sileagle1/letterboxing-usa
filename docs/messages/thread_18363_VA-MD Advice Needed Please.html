"The Mole" in Vienna is a very easy walk -- not sure about the distance <br/>
for you, but it's all very level and a paved path.  "Clark's Crossing" <br/>
is not much farther, but the terrain is not all level -- especially the <br/>
very first stretch, getting to the path itself.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck and hope your knee improves enough to do more serious boxing!<br/>

Sorry about the knee.  I seethat a coupleof people have <br/>
mentioned "The Mole", but I think that went missing a few months ago <br/>
(not absolutely sure, though).<br/>
<br/>
You might also try<br/>
<br/>
In Northern Virginia:<br/>
Mother Goose - flat, paved trail (not sure of status - thought I saw <br/>
someone post a message that it was missing a while back.  You might <br/>
want to check with the placer, first).<br/>
<br/>
Ma's Artistic Box - paved, relatively short walk<br/>
<br/>
In the Park Series #2 - definitely a drive-by.<br/>
<br/>
Shutterbug (a little longer, about a soccer field's worth of walking)<br/>
<br/>
Seneca Schoolhouse (Central Maryland) is also a drive-by.<br/>
<br/>
Hope things turn out OK.<br/>

I'm guessing you sprained or strained your knee - but then we've had people with blue and red hands asking for advice before, so maybe you did stain your knee.  Who am I to judge?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know the area, but on the intense non-outdoors days I took to making indoor letterbooks for libraries.  It's not as sexy as finding them, but the community seems to have appreciated it.  There's also hitchhikers to be made.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I wasn't exactly on-topic for the question, but you can still be "in the game"!<br/>

directions and trying to figure which to try today!<br/>

Although I love carving stamps and making logbooks I've <br/>

I've been afraid of getting out too far on the trail and <br/>
then finding myself unable to get back. Every step hurts, <br/>

Hmmm, <br/>
<br/>
Personally I'd recommend Patty in Columbia, MD.. if you park where you're advised to, the <br/>
walk is quite short. Less than a mile round trip back to your car. (I walk with a cane due to <br/>
Multiple Sclerosis and found it one of the easiest walks yet.)<br/>

  As most people know, with two little (sometimes not always outwardly <br/>

down the walk without missing much.<br/>

Hope that helps!<br/>

Once the sun comes out and the trails dry up (still wearing moldy sneakers <br/>

&gt;Date: Wed, 07 Apr 2004 12:27:25 -0000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have been so bummed, having stained my knee on<br/>
&gt;a January letterboxing expedition and consequently<br/>
&gt;I've been unable to do much boxing lately. With my<br/>
&gt;knee having gotten progressively worse I'm now<br/>
&gt;scheduled for arthroscopic surgery and hope it<br/>
&gt;eventually gets better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In the meantime, I'm suffering boxing withdrawal! It<br/>
&gt;is imperetive I get a fix soon! Can anyone recommend<br/>
&gt;boxes which are nearly drive by? I'm looking for<br/>
&gt;something like Puddle Duck which has a short fairly<br/>
&gt;easy walk. The Runway 17-35 letterbox is within my<br/>
&gt;distance, but the terrain is too rough. I have a<br/>
&gt;boxing companion so the retrieval can be off trail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I live in Northern VA, but I'm willing to do some<br/>
&gt;driving (2-3 hours one way). DC is also a possiblility,<br/>
&gt;but keep in mind that I need nearby parking. I'm not<br/>
&gt;able to do the amount of walking that riding Metro<br/>
&gt;requires.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I hope I've given enough information on my capabilies<br/>
&gt;at this point to help you think of boxes. Any<br/>
&gt;recommendations would be appreciated!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
&gt;Mahjong<br/>

hope by now your knee is doing better and the taxes don't have you <br/>
down.<br/>
<br/>
In NoVA - try "A Flower for Mildred" in Fort Ward Park, Alexandria.  <br/>
Actually you can drive pretty close - but there are about 8-10 steps <br/>
to deal with.  And it is a lovely area.<br/>
