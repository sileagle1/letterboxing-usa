<br/>
Thanks for the MD advice on containers. I didn't know that, <br/>
although that's what I've been using. Anything else that MD <br/>
planters should know? I just put one at Swallow Falls (clues to <br/>
come--a drive by), and most of my plants will be in MD parks.<br/>

&gt; That sounds like a good price but they are a solid color. The <br/>
State <br/>
&gt; park service in MD requested that clear containers be used. It <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; probably a security issue. Anyway you might want to rethink the <br/>
&gt; bargin if you have to replace them all with clear containers in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; next year or so. Just a thought.<br/>

&gt; &gt; On our road/letterboxing trip through Wy.,Mt.,Utah,Idaho, <br/>
Gwen &amp; I <br/>
&gt; came across some containers at a war surplus store in Idaho <br/>
Falls. <br/>
&gt; They are made of plastic,a little larger than a pack of <br/>
&gt; cigarettes,olive drab,and cost 99 cents. They held "Decon" kits, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; are waterproof. They seem to be perfect for letterboxing. I <br/>
peeled <br/>
&gt; off the label and sanded off the raised writing on the top, and <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; was placed in our Seal Beach Town Tour yesterday (clues to <br/>
be posted <br/>
&gt; soon). Check out your local surplus store. Don <br/>
