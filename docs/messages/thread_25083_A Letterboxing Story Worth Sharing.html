                    <div class="plaintext-content">Please forgive my longwindedness and please read this post if you have the time. I've been wanting to give my own take on mine and DMS's experiences in Vermont, but in all the drama of the last several days I've been worried it would get lost. Things seem to have blown over a bit, so I'd like to post it now. I'm sure Mitch considered writing about it himself, but I imagine his take on what happened might be so personal, he's had difficulty putting it into words. So as a third party observer, I thought I might give it a try - because it's a story worth sharing, one that I feel so lucky to have experienced, and one that I hope might touch some others as it did me. <br/>
<br/>
When DMS and I first heard about the Back to Our Roots Gathering, we'd already made our travel plans for the summer. We're leaving for a month-long road trip centered around vending at LB-Con in St. Louis, and our entire travel budget and vacation allotments for the YEAR had already been completely taken by these plans. So the answer to "Can we go?" Was an unequivocable "No!" But still, the possibility just nagged and nagged at Mitch and there wasn't a day that went by that he didn't utter the phrase "Man, I just wish there was some way we could make it work." <br/>
<br/>
You see, 10 years ago, when the first ever gathering happened in Killington, VT, Der Mad Stamper was, as I understand it, the only conspicuously absent member of that original founding American Clan of our now favorite pasttime. Oregon is a long way from Vermont and the travel distance was a lot easier for most of those other originators. So it was understandable, with Mark Pepe planning surprises up his sleeve, and with him also dropping plenty of hints that those surprises were actually his attempts to get as many of those early pioneers as possible to attend this anniversary gathering, that Mitch was a bit obsessed with the idea of somehow making it out.<br/>
<br/>
As the weeks passed, I became very aware that a hole created with his absence at that first gathering ten years ago was still sitting empty somewhere in his heart, and that perhaps, if we could just make it work, a trip to Back to Our Roots might just be what he needed to finally fill it in. So in spite of all the reasonable and financial reasons for why it was an awful idea, we found ways to tighten our belts and make the trip. Of course, Mark had sworn us to secrecy, keeping us from signing up on the AQ list or letting anyone know we were coming. We knew he must be doing the same to many of those other "old timers", but it was anyone's guess who might actually show up.<br/>
<br/>
DMS wondered aloud many times during the few weeks about who might be there. Who, among all of those he's formed lifelong bonds with, communicating only by computer, might he finally be able to attach a face and a smile to the personality he could only imagine he'd guessed at correctly? He mentioned Randy Hall, Tom Cooch, Silent Doug, Jay Drew, and several others I can't remember. He wondered especially about Susan Davis - the one he's always described to me as "The Peacekeeper", the one who helped them all keep things in perspective when early debates between all those boys, including her husband Erik who's now passed away, turned petty.<br/>
<br/>
And what a gratifying gathering it was! There were so many wonderful friends to see again, and people to meet for the first time - those we thought would be there and those we hoped would, and so many others that weren't expected at all but who were just as delightful. Just to name a few: Choi, Silent Doug, Silver Eagle and Team Green Dragon (especially Brian, who must admit along with Mitch that they have shared as many snappish words as kind ones with each other over the years - it's about time those two found out thy might actually be able to get along!) And then there was Tom Cooch, who hasn't been around much in recent years, and who Mitch really only hoped wistfully might show up. And yet there he was, and the two hugged like old friends, even though they were meeting for the first time. I can only imagine he felt like he was surrounded by long lost family. And even though not every single one of those Killington Folk were able to make it - Susan Davis couldn't, and a few others too, there was enough magical experiences at that gathering to last a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
And I guess if you've gotten through all my babbling so far, it's time to tell you that all of this has really just been the lead-in to what was truly one of the most special moments I've ever witnessed in my lifetime: <br/>
<br/>
As Mitch mentioned in his own post a couple of days ago, outside of the actual gathering, we only made time for two (yes, two - I know it's pitiful!) letterboxes for the entire trip. That was my fault mostly - I have too-rarely-seen family in the area so the vacation was serving a dual purpose and we had other obligations to meet that week as well. But during the little free time we were able to devote to boxing, we made two decisions: get one box in Killington as we were passing through, since it was the site of the first gathering (we chose "James P. Taylor"), and get over to Bristol for the newly replaced "Prayer Rock". Well the Killington had its own wonderful rainy adventures, as Mitch has already described, but it was our finding of "Prayer Rock" that he seems to have chosen not to describe. Like I mentioned before, I can only imagine that his experience in finding the box that he really feels was the first one was personal to share with others. But it's such a wonderful story that, even though he doesn't know I'm doing so, I thought that perhaps my bystander account might be just as special without making him feel quite so exposed.<br/>
<br/>
It really was just a "find" like any other; a few compass readings and a confusion or two before the final moment of enlightment. We sat at a picnic table visible from the road, opened the box, looked through the too-short logbook wishing we could have seen the original, before spreading our inks and books out for a luxuriously slow stamping in process. There was even the all-too-common moment when another car pulled in and we discussed whether we should put away our mess, or at least consolidate it, before nosey tourists felt the need to ask us too many questions. Being a little lazier than we probably should be, we did none of these and left everything lying about, and I proceeded to ink up the stamp. The occupants of the car got out - a woman and a young man on the verge of adulthood. They started walking toward us, which wasn't so odd since our table lay between them and the infamous "Prayer Rock" that the clue is named for. But instead of a curious and polite nod as they walked by, they came up to us directly, and the woman looked blatantly over Mitch's shoulder at the stamp in my hands. Thinking perhaps these two were just the investigative sort, I gave a polite hello, and waited for the inevitable questions about what we were up to. But the first words she uttered were an unexpected, "I've been wanting to see how the new carving turned out." Realizing at last that these were fellow letterboxers, I asked in reply, "Oh, did you have the opportunity to see the orignal?" To which the young man standing behind her replied, "Yeah, she CARVED the original."<br/>
<br/>
It was this moment that I made the connection, although Mitch stayed oddly quiet, given who we were obviously, magically, sitting next to. I asked what had to be asked though, "Are YOU Susan Davis?" to which she humbly nodded a slight affirmative. (Mitch told us all later that his delay in making the connection was because he was reacting internally to her carving claim with the thought, "No you didn't! Susan Davis carved that stamp!") At this point, the truth finally sunk in with DMS and he quite literally leaped from his seat at the table, coming close to mauling the poor woman before he seemed to realize that she had no idea who he was and looked momentarily scared to death. So stopping mid-embrace and instead reaching out a hand for a shake, he said "Susan, I'm Mitch. I'm Der Mad Stamper." Well her eyes got as wide as his did moments before and I hope I'm not embarrassing either one of them too badly by telling you all that they probably hugged for a solid 3 minutes, tears and all! (I even took a sneaky picture.)<br/>
<br/>
When the novelty of the situation finally abating, we all sat and had a truly beautiful conversation. The young man turned out to be Benjamin, Erik and Susan's son who had just graduated from high school a week earlier.  We showed them the one other image of theirs that we had found the day before in Killington, and Ben reminisced about how he, at 8 years old, had been the one to actually do the hiding because he was the only one small enough to comfortably crawl into its hiding spot (and yes, it had been a tight squeeze for us!). Mitch and Susan discussed old times, both happy and sad, and I got to bear witness to it all. We stamped into the box, and both Susan and Ben signed our books and gave us each their inky thumbprints as an exchange. Mitch mentioned the "Peacekeeper" label he had given her years before, and she laughed and told me about how all those boys really had needed a mom. And both of them also talked about letterboxing and what it has meant to them over the years. The people, the connections, the adventure, the friends made and lost - and even how this hobby and its members, as odd as it may seem, has been a lifeline to some in their times of grief. I will always, always feel thankful for my opportunity to sit and hear these stories. <br/>
<br/>
Now I'm not a person of faith. I'm not even one to believe that coincidence is anything more than random occurences that we just happen to place meaning on because they feel special. And I'm certainly not inviting anyone to try and convince me otherwise today. But I just can't deny it;  something was in the air there in Vermont for our entire trip, and especially on that day. When I think of everything that needed to fall into place for us to be visible from the road at that moment that Susan and Ben were driving by, for them to look over and recognize us as letterboxers, and for them to take the time out of their errands to stop and say hello - all I can say is that I believe in wonder that is letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
Because there's a reason this pasttime has taken hold so well. It goes beyond the fun of carving or writing clues, the thrill of the hike, the satisfaction of collecting images, the social and family fun. It's because this activity is a way for us to put our own special take on the world out there so others can see through our eyes - and so we can see through theirs. It's because carving these silly stamps and writing these silly clues is a wonderfully pure way to share a little bit of our souls with each other. And all I can say is, thank goodness that a few people who shared that early vision, as scattered about the country as they were, found each other and organized it all, so that the rest of us could have this outlet. Many of them have had the opportunity to meet over the years, but DMS had met very few - and watching him finally make those connections was like watching a very very special process that started over a decade ago finally come full circle.

      Please forgive my longwindedness and please read this post if you have the time. I've been wanting to give my own take on mine and DMS's experiences in Vermont, but in all the drama of the last several days I've been worried it would get lost. Things seem to have blown over a bit, so I'd like to post it now. I'm sure Mitch considered writing about it himself, but I imagine his take on what happened might be so personal, he's had difficulty putting it into words. So as a third party observer, I thought I might give it a try - because it's a story worth sharing, one that I feel so lucky to have experienced, and one that I hope might touch some others as it did me. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When DMS and I first heard about the Back to Our Roots Gathering, we'd already made our travel plans for the summer. We're leaving for a month-long road trip centered around vending at LB-Con in St. Louis, and our entire travel budget and vacation allotments for the YEAR had already been completely taken by these plans. So the answer to "Can we go?" Was an unequivocable "No!" But still, the possibility just nagged and nagged at Mitch and there wasn't a day that went by that he didn't utter the phrase "Man, I just wish there was some way we could make it work." <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You see, 10 years ago, when the first ever gathering happened in Killington, VT, Der Mad Stamper was, as I understand it, the only conspicuously absent member of that original founding American Clan of our now favorite pasttime. Oregon is a long way from Vermont and the travel distance was a lot easier for most of those other originators. So it was understandable, with Mark Pepe planning surprises up his sleeve, and with him also dropping plenty of hints that those surprises were actually his attempts to get as many of those early pioneers as possible to attend this anniversary gathering, that Mitch was a bit obsessed with the idea of somehow making it out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As the weeks passed, I became very aware that a hole created with his absence at that first gathering ten years ago was still sitting empty somewhere in his heart, and that perhaps, if we could just make it work, a trip to Back to Our Roots might just be what he needed to finally fill it in. So in spite of all the reasonable and financial reasons for why it was an awful idea, we found ways to tighten our belts and make the trip. Of course, Mark had sworn us to secrecy, keeping us from signing up on the AQ list or letting anyone know we were coming. We knew he must be doing the same to many of those other "old timers", but it was anyone's guess who might actually show up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DMS wondered aloud many times during the few weeks about who might be there. Who, among all of those he's formed lifelong bonds with, communicating only by computer, might he finally be able to attach a face and a smile to the personality he could only imagine he'd guessed at correctly? He mentioned Randy Hall, Tom Cooch, Silent Doug, Jay Drew, and several others I can't remember. He wondered especially about Susan Davis - the one he's always described to me as "The Peacekeeper" , the one who helped them all keep things in perspective when early debates between all those boys, including her husband Erik who's now passed away, turned petty.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And what a gratifying gathering it was! There were so many wonderful friends to see again, and people to meet for the first time - those we thought would be there and those we hoped would, and so many others that weren't expected at all but who were just as delightful. Just to name a few: Choi, Silent Doug, Silver Eagle and Team Green Dragon (especially Brian, who must admit along with Mitch that they have shared as many snappish words as kind ones with each other over the years - it's about time those two found out thy might actually be able to get along!) And then there was Tom Cooch, who hasn't been around much in recent years, and who Mitch really only hoped wistfully might show up. And yet there he was, and the two hugged like old friends, even though they were meeting for the first time. I can only imagine he felt like he was surrounded by long lost family. And even though not every single one of those Killington Folk were able to make it - Susan<br/>
 Davis couldn't, and a few others too, there was enough magical experiences at that gathering to last a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I guess if you've gotten through all my babbling so far, it's time to tell you that all of this has really just been the lead-in to what was truly one of the most special moments I've ever witnessed in my lifetime: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As Mitch mentioned in his own post a couple of days ago, outside of the actual gathering, we only made time for two (yes, two - I know it's pitiful!) letterboxes for the entire trip. That was my fault mostly - I have too-rarely-seen family in the area so the vacation was serving a dual purpose and we had other obligations to meet that week as well. But during the little free time we were able to devote to boxing, we made two decisions: get one box in Killington as we were passing through, since it was the site of the first gathering (we chose "James P. Taylor"), and get over to Bristol for the newly replaced "Prayer Rock". Well the Killington had its own wonderful rainy adventures, as Mitch has already described, but it was our finding of "Prayer Rock" that he seems to have chosen not to describe. Like I mentioned before, I can only imagine that his experience in finding the box that he really feels was the first one was personal to share with others.<br/>
 But it's such a wonderful story that, even though he doesn't know I'm doing so, I thought that perhaps my bystander account might be just as special without making him feel quite so exposed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It really was just a "find" like any other; a few compass readings and a confusion or two before the final moment of enlightment. We sat at a picnic table visible from the road, opened the box, looked through the too-short logbook wishing we could have seen the original, before spreading our inks and books out for a luxuriously slow stamping in process. There was even the all-too-common moment when another car pulled in and we discussed whether we should put away our mess, or at least consolidate it, before nosey tourists felt the need to ask us too many questions. Being a little lazier than we probably should be, we did none of these and left everything lying about, and I proceeded to ink up the stamp. The occupants of the car got out - a woman and a young man on the verge of adulthood. They started walking toward us, which wasn't so odd since our table lay between them and the infamous "Prayer Rock" that the clue is named for. But instead of a curious<br/>
 and polite nod as they walked by, they came up to us directly, and the woman looked blatantly over Mitch's shoulder at the stamp in my hands. Thinking perhaps these two were just the investigative sort, I gave a polite hello, and waited for the inevitable questions about what we were up to. But the first words she uttered were an unexpected, "I've been wanting to see how the new carving turned out." Realizing at last that these were fellow letterboxers, I asked in reply, "Oh, did you have the opportunity to see the orignal?" To which the young man standing behind her replied, "Yeah, she CARVED the original."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was this moment that I made the connection, although Mitch stayed oddly quiet, given who we were obviously, magically, sitting next to. I asked what had to be asked though, "Are YOU Susan Davis?" to which she humbly nodded a slight affirmative. (Mitch told us all later that his delay in making the connection was because he was reacting internally to her carving claim with the thought, "No you didn't! Susan Davis carved that stamp!") At this point, the truth finally sunk in with DMS and he quite literally leaped from his seat at the table, coming close to mauling the poor woman before he seemed to realize that she had no idea who he was and looked momentarily scared to death. So stopping mid-embrace and instead reaching out a hand for a shake, he said "Susan, I'm Mitch. I'm Der Mad Stamper." Well her eyes got as wide as his did moments before and I hope I'm not embarrassing either one of them too badly by telling you all that they probably hugged for a<br/>
 solid 3 minutes, tears and all! (I even took a sneaky picture.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When the novelty of the situation finally abating, we all sat and had a truly beautiful conversation. The young man turned out to be Benjamin, Erik and Susan's son who had just graduated from high school a week earlier.  We showed them the one other image of theirs that we had found the day before in Killington, and Ben reminisced about how he, at 8 years old, had been the one to actually do the hiding because he was the only one small enough to comfortably crawl into its hiding spot (and yes, it had been a tight squeeze for us!). Mitch and Susan discussed old times, both happy and sad, and I got to bear witness to it all. We stamped into the box, and both Susan and Ben signed our books and gave us each their inky thumbprints as an exchange. Mitch mentioned the "Peacekeeper" label he had given her years before, and she laughed and told me about how all those boys really had needed a mom. And both of them also talked about letterboxing and what it has<br/>
 meant to them over the years. The people, the connections, the adventure, the friends made and lost - and even how this hobby and its members, as odd as it may seem, has been a lifeline to some in their times of grief. I will always, always feel thankful for my opportunity to sit and hear these stories. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm not a person of faith. I'm not even one to believe that coincidence is anything more than random occurences that we just happen to place meaning on because they feel special. And I'm certainly not inviting anyone to try and convince me otherwise today. But I just can't deny it;  something was in the air there in Vermont for our entire trip, and especially on that day. When I think of everything that needed to fall into place for us to be visible from the road at that moment that Susan and Ben were driving by, for them to look over and recognize us as letterboxers, and for them to take the time out of their errands to stop and say hello - all I can say is that I believe in wonder that is letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because there's a reason this pasttime has taken hold so well. It goes beyond the fun of carving or writing clues, the thrill of the hike, the satisfaction of collecting images, the social and family fun. It's because this activity is a way for us to put our own special take on the world out there so others can see through our eyes - and so we can see through theirs. It's because carving these silly stamps and writing these silly clues is a wonderfully pure way to share a little bit of our souls with each other. And all I can say is, thank goodness that a few people who shared that early vision, as scattered about the country as they were, found each other and organized it all, so that the rest of us could have this outlet. Many of them have had the opportunity to meet over the years, but DMS had met very few - and watching him finally make those connections was like watching a very very special process that started over a decade ago finally come full<br/>
 circle. Kismet.<br/>

That was a wonderful account. Thank you for sharing this. It choked me  <br/>
up to picture Mitch meeting Susan at that site. Two great stampers and  <br/>
two great people.<br/>

&gt; Please forgive my longwindedness and please read this post if you have the time. I've been wanting to give my own take on mine and DMS's experiences in Vermont, but in all the drama of the last several days I've been worried it would get lost. Things seem to have blown over a bit, so I'd like to post it now. I'm sure Mitch considered writing about it himself, but I imagine his take on what happened might be so personal, he's had difficulty putting it into words. So as a third party observer, I thought I might give it a try - because it's a story worth sharing, one that I feel so lucky to have experienced, and one that I hope might touch some others as it did me. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When DMS and I first heard about the Back to Our Roots Gathering, we'd already made our travel plans for the summer. We're leaving for a month-long road trip centered around vending at LB-Con in St. Louis, and our entire travel budget and vacation allotments for the YEAR had already been completely taken by these plans. So the answer to "Can we go?" Was an unequivocable "No!" But still, the possibility just nagged and nagged at Mitch and there wasn't a day that went by that he didn't utter the phrase "Man, I just wish there was some way we could make it work." <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You see, 10 years ago, when the first ever gathering happened in Killington, VT, Der Mad Stamper was, as I understand it, the only conspicuously absent member of that original founding American Clan of our now favorite pasttime. Oregon is a long way from Vermont and the travel distance was a lot easier for most of those other originators. So it was understandable, with Mark Pepe planning surprises up his sleeve, and with him also dropping plenty of hints that those surprises were actually his attempts to get as many of those early pioneers as possible to attend this anniversary gathering, that Mitch was a bit obsessed with the idea of somehow making it out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As the weeks passed, I became very aware that a hole created with his absence at that first gathering ten years ago was still sitting empty somewhere in his heart, and that perhaps, if we could just make it work, a trip to Back to Our Roots might just be what he needed to finally fill it in. So in spite of all the reasonable and financial reasons for why it was an awful idea, we found ways to tighten our belts and make the trip. Of course, Mark had sworn us to secrecy, keeping us from signing up on the AQ list or letting anyone know we were coming. We knew he must be doing the same to many of those other "old timers", but it was anyone's guess who might actually show up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; DMS wondered aloud many times during the few weeks about who might be there. Who, among all of those he's formed lifelong bonds with, communicating only by computer, might he finally be able to attach a face and a smile to the personality he could only imagine he'd guessed at correctly? He mentioned Randy Hall, Tom Cooch, Silent Doug, Jay Drew, and several others I can't remember. He wondered especially about Susan Davis - the one he's always described to me as "The Peacekeeper", the one who helped them all keep things in perspective when early debates between all those boys, including her husband Erik who's now passed away, turned petty.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And what a gratifying gathering it was! There were so many wonderful friends to see again, and people to meet for the first time - those we thought would be there and those we hoped would, and so many others that weren't expected at all but who were just as delightful. Just to name a few: Choi, Silent Doug, Silver Eagle and Team Green Dragon (especially Brian, who must admit along with Mitch that they have shared as many snappish words as kind ones with each other over the years - it's about time those two found out thy might actually be able to get along!) And then there was Tom Cooch, who hasn't been around much in recent years, and who Mitch really only hoped wistfully might show up. And yet there he was, and the two hugged like old friends, even though they were meeting for the first time. I can only imagine he felt like he was surrounded by long lost family. And even though not every single one of those Killington Folk were able to make it - Susan Davis couldn't, and a few others too, there was enough magical experiences at that gathering to last a lifetime.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And I guess if you've gotten through all my babbling so far, it's time to tell you that all of this has really just been the lead-in to what was truly one of the most special moments I've ever witnessed in my lifetime: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As Mitch mentioned in his own post a couple of days ago, outside of the actual gathering, we only made time for two (yes, two - I know it's pitiful!) letterboxes for the entire trip. That was my fault mostly - I have too-rarely-seen family in the area so the vacation was serving a dual purpose and we had other obligations to meet that week as well. But during the little free time we were able to devote to boxing, we made two decisions: get one box in Killington as we were passing through, since it was the site of the first gathering (we chose "James P. Taylor"), and get over to Bristol for the newly replaced "Prayer Rock". Well the Killington had its own wonderful rainy adventures, as Mitch has already described, but it was our finding of "Prayer Rock" that he seems to have chosen not to describe. Like I mentioned before, I can only imagine that his experience in finding the box that he really feels was the first one was personal to share with others. But it's such a wonderful story that, even though he doesn't know I'm doing so, I thought that perhaps my bystander account might be just as special without making him feel quite so exposed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It really was just a "find" like any other; a few compass readings and a confusion or two before the final moment of enlightment. We sat at a picnic table visible from the road, opened the box, looked through the too-short logbook wishing we could have seen the original, before spreading our inks and books out for a luxuriously slow stamping in process. There was even the all-too-common moment when another car pulled in and we discussed whether we should put away our mess, or at least consolidate it, before nosey tourists felt the need to ask us too many questions. Being a little lazier than we probably should be, we did none of these and left everything lying about, and I proceeded to ink up the stamp. The occupants of the car got out - a woman and a young man on the verge of adulthood. They started walking toward us, which wasn't so odd since our table lay between them and the infamous "Prayer Rock" that the clue is named for. But instead of a curious and polite nod as they walked by, they came up to us directly, and the woman looked blatantly over Mitch's shoulder at the stamp in my hands. Thinking perhaps these two were just the investigative sort, I gave a polite hello, and waited for the inevitable questions about what we were up to. But the first words she uttered were an unexpected, "I've been wanting to see how the new carving turned out." Realizing at last that these were fellow letterboxers, I asked in reply, "Oh, did you have the opportunity to see the orignal?" To which the young man standing behind her replied, "Yeah, she CARVED the original."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was this moment that I made the connection, although Mitch stayed oddly quiet, given who we were obviously, magically, sitting next to. I asked what had to be asked though, "Are YOU Susan Davis?" to which she humbly nodded a slight affirmative. (Mitch told us all later that his delay in making the connection was because he was reacting internally to her carving claim with the thought, "No you didn't! Susan Davis carved that stamp!") At this point, the truth finally sunk in with DMS and he quite literally leaped from his seat at the table, coming close to mauling the poor woman before he seemed to realize that she had no idea who he was and looked momentarily scared to death. So stopping mid-embrace and instead reaching out a hand for a shake, he said "Susan, I'm Mitch. I'm Der Mad Stamper." Well her eyes got as wide as his did moments before and I hope I'm not embarrassing either one of them too badly by telling you all that they probably hugged for a solid 3 minutes, tears and all! (I even took a sneaky picture.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When the novelty of the situation finally abating, we all sat and had a truly beautiful conversation. The young man turned out to be Benjamin, Erik and Susan's son who had just graduated from high school a week earlier.  We showed them the one other image of theirs that we had found the day before in Killington, and Ben reminisced about how he, at 8 years old, had been the one to actually do the hiding because he was the only one small enough to comfortably crawl into its hiding spot (and yes, it had been a tight squeeze for us!). Mitch and Susan discussed old times, both happy and sad, and I got to bear witness to it all. We stamped into the box, and both Susan and Ben signed our books and gave us each their inky thumbprints as an exchange. Mitch mentioned the "Peacekeeper" label he had given her years before, and she laughed and told me about how all those boys really had needed a mom. And both of them also talked about letterboxing and what it has meant to them over the years. The people, the connections, the adventure, the friends made and lost - and even how this hobby and its members, as odd as it may seem, has been a lifeline to some in their times of grief. I will always, always feel thankful for my opportunity to sit and hear these stories. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now I'm not a person of faith. I'm not even one to believe that coincidence is anything more than random occurences that we just happen to place meaning on because they feel special. And I'm certainly not inviting anyone to try and convince me otherwise today. But I just can't deny it;  something was in the air there in Vermont for our entire trip, and especially on that day. When I think of everything that needed to fall into place for us to be visible from the road at that moment that Susan and Ben were driving by, for them to look over and recognize us as letterboxers, and for them to take the time out of their errands to stop and say hello - all I can say is that I believe in wonder that is letterboxing. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Because there's a reason this pasttime has taken hold so well. It goes beyond the fun of carving or writing clues, the thrill of the hike, the satisfaction of collecting images, the social and family fun. It's because this activity is a way for us to put our own special take on the world out there so others can see through our eyes - and so we can see through theirs. It's because carving these silly stamps and writing these silly clues is a wonderfully pure way to share a little bit of our souls with each other. And all I can say is, thank goodness that a few people who shared that early vision, as scattered about the country as they were, found each other and organized it all, so that the rest of us could have this outlet. Many of them have had the opportunity to meet over the years, but DMS had met very few - and watching him finally make those connections was like watching a very very special process that started over a decade ago finally come full circle.

It's a long story, how we started corresponding, but it was a slow process. We "met" through a letterboxing related endeavor and a mutual friend, and through early communications a friendship was formed that turned into more over about 2-1/2 years. Eventually, we decided to give it a real chance, and here I am now in Oregon!<br/>

Just to name a few: Choi, Silent Doug, Silver Eagle and Team Green Dragon (especially Brian, who must admit along with Mitch that they have shared as many snappish words as kind ones with each other over the years - it's about time those two found out thy might actually be able to get along!) And then there was Tom Cooch, who hasn't been around much in recent years, and who Mitch really only hoped wistfully might show up. And yet there he was, and the two hugged like old friends, even though they were meeting for the first time. I can only imagine he felt like he was surrounded by long lost family. And even though not every single one of those Killington Folk were able to make it - Susan Davis couldn't, and a few others too, there was enough magical experiences at that gathering to last a lifetime.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And I guess if you've gotten through all my babbling so far, it's time to tell you that all of this has really just been the lead-in to what was truly one of the most special moments I've ever witnessed in my lifetime: <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As Mitch mentioned in his own post a couple of days ago, outside of the actual gathering, we only made time for two (yes, two - I know it's pitiful!) letterboxes for the entire trip. That was my fault mostly - I have too-rarely-seen family in the area so the vacation was serving a dual purpose and we had other obligations to meet that week as well. But during the little free time we were able to devote to boxing, we made two decisions: get one box in Killington as we were passing through, since it was the site of the first gathering (we chose "James P. Taylor"), and get over to Bristol for the newly replaced "Prayer Rock". Well the Killington had its own wonderful rainy adventures, as Mitch has already described, but it was our finding of "Prayer Rock" that he seems to have chosen not to describe. Like I mentioned before, I can only imagine that his experience in finding the box that he really feels was the first one was personal to share with others. But it's such a wonderful story that, even though he doesn't know I'm doing so, I thought that perhaps my bystander account might be just as special without making him feel quite so exposed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It really was just a "find" like any other; a few compass readings and a confusion or two before the final moment of enlightment. We sat at a picnic table visible from the road, opened the box, looked through the too-short logbook wishing we could have seen the original, before spreading our inks and books out for a luxuriously slow stamping in process. There was even the all-too-common moment when another car pulled in and we discussed whether we should put away our mess, or at least consolidate it, before nosey tourists felt the need to ask us too many questions. Being a little lazier than we probably should be, we did none of these and left everything lying about, and I proceeded to ink up the stamp. The occupants of the car got out - a woman and a young man on the verge of adulthood. They started walking toward us, which wasn't so odd since our table lay between them and the infamous "Prayer Rock" that the clue is named for. But instead of a curious and polite nod as they walked by, they came up to us directly, and the woman looked blatantly over Mitch's shoulder at the stamp in my hands. Thinking perhaps these two were just the investigative sort, I gave a polite hello, and waited for the inevitable questions about what we were up to. But the first words she uttered were an unexpected, "I've been wanting to see how the new carving turned out." Realizing at last that these were fellow letterboxers, I asked in reply, "Oh, did you have the opportunity to see the orignal?" To which the young man standing behind her replied, "Yeah, she CARVED the original."<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It was this moment that I made the connection, although Mitch stayed oddly quiet, given who we were obviously, magically, sitting next to. I asked what had to be asked though, "Are YOU Susan Davis?" to which she humbly nodded a slight affirmative. (Mitch told us all later that his delay in making the connection was because he was reacting internally to her carving claim with the thought, "No you didn't! Susan Davis carved that stamp!") At this point, the truth finally sunk in with DMS and he quite literally leaped from his seat at the table, coming close to mauling the poor woman before he seemed to realize that she had no idea who he was and looked momentarily scared to death. So stopping mid-embrace and instead reaching out a hand for a shake, he said "Susan, I'm Mitch. I'm Der Mad Stamper." Well her eyes got as wide as his did moments before and I hope I'm not embarrassing either one of them too badly by telling you all that they probably hugged for a solid 3 minutes, tears and all! (I even took a sneaky picture.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; When the novelty of the situation finally abating, we all sat and had a truly beautiful conversation. The young man turned out to be Benjamin, Erik and Susan's son who had just graduated from high school a week earlier.  We showed them the one other image of theirs that we had found the day before in Killington, and Ben reminisced about how he, at 8 years old, had been the one to actually do the hiding because he was the only one small enough to comfortably crawl into its hiding spot (and yes, it had been a tight squeeze for us!). Mitch and Susan discussed old times, both happy and sad, and I got to bear witness to it all. We stamped into the box, and both Susan and Ben signed our books and gave us each their inky thumbprints as an exchange. Mitch mentioned the "Peacekeeper" label he had given her years before, and she laughed and told me about how all those boys really had needed a mom. And both of them also talked about letterboxing and what it has meant to them over the years. The people, the connections, the adventure, the friends made and lost - and even how this hobby and its members, as odd as it may seem, has been a lifeline to some in their times of grief. I will always, always feel thankful for my opportunity to sit and hear these stories. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now I'm not a person of faith. I'm not even one to believe that coincidence is anything more than random occurences that we just happen to place meaning on because they feel special. And I'm certainly not inviting anyone to try and convince me otherwise today. But I just can't deny it;  something was in the air there in Vermont for our entire trip, and especially on that day. When I think of everything that needed to fall into place for us to be visible from the road at that moment that Susan and Ben were driving by, for them to look over and recognize us as letterboxers, and for them to take the time out of their errands to stop and say hello - all I can say is that I believe in wonder that is letterboxing. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Because there's a reason this pasttime has taken hold so well. It goes beyond the fun of carving or writing clues, the thrill of the hike, the satisfaction of collecting images, the social and family fun. It's because this activity is a way for us to put our own special take on the world out there so others can see through our eyes - and so we can see through theirs. It's because carving these silly stamps and writing these silly clues is a wonderfully pure way to share a little bit of our souls with each other. And all I can say is, thank goodness that a few people who shared that early vision, as scattered about the country as they were, found each other and organized it all, so that the rest of us could have this outlet. Many of them have had the opportunity to meet over the years, but DMS had met very few - and watching him finally make those connections was like watching a very very special process that started over a decade ago finally come full circle.

<br/>
Please forgive my longwindedness and please read this post if you have the time. I've been wanting to give my own take on mine and DMS's experiences in Vermont, but in all the drama of the last several days I've been worried it would get lost. Things seem to have blown over a bit, so I'd like to post it now. I'm sure Mitch considered writing about it himself, but I imagine his take on what happened might be so personal, he's had difficulty putting it into words. So as a third party observer, I thought I might give it a try - because it's a story worth sharing, one that I feel so lucky to have experienced, and one that I hope might touch some others as it did me. <br/>
<br/>
When DMS and I first heard about the Back to Our Roots Gathering, we'd already made our travel plans for the summer. We're leaving for a month-long road trip centered around vending at LB-Con in St. Louis, and our entire travel budget and vacation allotments for the YEAR had already been completely taken by these plans. So the answer to "Can we go?" Was an unequivocable "No!" But still, the possibility just nagged and nagged at Mitch and there wasn't a day that went by that he didn't utter the phrase "Man, I just wish there was some way we could make it work." <br/>
<br/>
You see, 10 years ago, when the first ever gathering happened in Killington, VT, Der Mad Stamper was, as I understand it, the only conspicuously absent member of that original founding American Clan of our now favorite pasttime. Oregon is a long way from Vermont and the travel distance was a lot easier for most of those other originators. So it was understandable, with Mark Pepe planning surprises up his sleeve, and with him also dropping plenty of hints that those surprises were actually his attempts to get as many of those early pioneers as possible to attend this anniversary gathering, that Mitch was a bit obsessed with the idea of somehow making it out.<br/>
<br/>
As the weeks passed, I became very aware that a hole created with his absence at that first gathering ten years ago was still sitting empty somewhere in his heart, and that perhaps, if we could just make it work, a trip to Back to Our Roots might just be what he needed to finally fill it in. So in spite of all the reasonable and financial reasons for why it was an awful idea, we found ways to tighten our belts and make the trip. Of course, Mark had sworn us to secrecy, keeping us from signing up on the AQ list or letting anyone know we were coming. We knew he must be doing the same to many of those other "old timers", but it was anyone's guess who might actually show up.<br/>
<br/>
DMS wondered aloud many times during the few weeks about who might be there.. Who, among all of those he's formed lifelong bonds with, communicating only by computer, might he finally be able to attach a face and a smile to the personality he could only imagine he'd guessed at correctly? He mentioned Randy Hall, Tom Cooch, Silent Doug, Jay Drew, and several others I can't remember. He wondered especially about Susan Davis - the one he's always described to me as "The Peacekeeper", the one who helped them all keep things in perspective when early debates between all those boys, including her husband Erik who's now passed away, turned petty.<br/>
<br/>
And what a gratifying gathering it was! There were so many wonderful friends to see again, and people to meet for the first time - those we thought would be there and those we hoped would, and so many others that weren't expected at all but who were just as delightful. Just to name a few: Choi, Silent Doug, Silver Eagle and Team Green Dragon (especially Brian, who must admit along with Mitch that they have shared as many snappish words as kind ones with each other over the years - it's about time those two found out thy might actually be able to get along!)

letterboxes for the entire  trip. That was my fault mostly - I have <br/>
too-rarely-seen family in the area so  the vacation was serving a dual purpose and <br/>
we had other obligations to meet  that week as well. But during the little <br/>
free time we were able to devote to  boxing, we made two decisions: get one <br/>
box in Killington as we were passing  through, since it was the site of the <br/>
first gathering (we chose "James P.  Taylor"), and get over to Bristol for <br/>
the newly replaced "Prayer Rock". Well  the Killington had its own wonderful <br/>
rainy adventures, as Mitch has already  described, but it was our finding of <br/>
"Prayer Rock" that he seems to have  chosen not to describe. Like I <br/>
mentioned before, I can only imagine that his  experience in finding the box that he <br/>
really feels was the first one was  personal to share with others. But it's <br/>
such a wonderful story that, even  though he doesn't know I'm doing so, I <br/>
thought that perhaps my bystander  account might be just as special without <br/>
making him feel quite so  exposed.<br/>
<br/>
It really was just a "find" like any other; a few compass  readings and a <br/>
confusion or two before the final moment of enlightment. We sat  at a picnic <br/>
table visible from the road, opened the box, looked through the  too-short <br/>
logbook wishing we could have seen the original, before spreading  our inks <br/>
and books out for a luxuriously slow stamping in process. There was  even the <br/>
all-too-common moment when another car pulled in and we discussed  whether <br/>
we should put away our mess, or at least consolidate it, before nosey  <br/>
tourists felt the need to ask us too many questions. Being a little lazier  than <br/>
we probably should be, we did none of these and left everything lying  <br/>
about, and I proceeded to ink up the stamp. The occupants of the car got out -  a <br/>
woman and a young man on the verge of adulthood. They started walking <br/>
toward  us, which wasn't so odd since our table lay between them and the infamous <br/>
 "Prayer Rock" that the clue is named for. But instead of a curious and <br/>
polite  nod as they walked by, they came up to us directly, and the woman <br/>
looked  blatantly over Mitch's shoulder at the stamp in my hands. Thinking <br/>
perhaps  these two were just the investigative sort, I gave a polite hello, and <br/>
waited  for the inevitable questions about what we were up to. But the first <br/>
words she  uttered were an unexpected, "I've been wanting to see how the new <br/>
carving  turned out." Realizing at last that these were fellow letterboxers, <br/>
I asked in  reply, "Oh, did you have the opportunity to see the orignal?" <br/>
To which the  young man standing behind her replied, "Yeah, she CARVED the  <br/>
original."<br/>
<br/>
It was this moment that I made the connection, although  Mitch stayed oddly <br/>
quiet, given who we were obviously, magically, sitting next  to. I asked <br/>
what had to be asked though, "Are YOU Susan Davis?" to which she  humbly <br/>
nodded a slight affirmative. (Mitch told us all later that his delay in  making <br/>
the connection was because he was reacting internally to her carving  claim <br/>
with the thought, "No you didn't! Susan Davis carved that stamp!") At  this <br/>
point, the truth finally sunk in with DMS and he quite literally leaped  from <br/>
his seat at the table, coming close to mauling the poor woman before he  <br/>
seemed to realize that she had no idea who he was and looked momentarily  <br/>
scared to death. So stopping mid-embrace and instead reaching out a hand for a  <br/>
shake, he said "Susan, I'm Mitch. I'm Der Mad Stamper." Well her eyes got as <br/>
 wide as his did moments before and I hope I'm not embarrassing either one <br/>
of  them too badly by telling you all that they probably hugged for a solid <br/>
3  minutes, tears and all! (I even took a sneaky picture.)<br/>
<br/>
When the  novelty of the situation finally abating, we all sat and had a <br/>
truly beautiful  conversation. The young man turned out to be Benjamin, Erik <br/>
and Susan's son  who had just graduated from high school a week earlier.  We <br/>
showed them  the one other image of theirs that we had found the day before <br/>
in Killington,  and Ben reminisced about how he, at 8 years old, had been <br/>
the one to actually  do the hiding because he was the only one small enough to <br/>
comfortably crawl  into its hiding spot (and yes, it had been a tight <br/>
squeeze for us!). Mitch and  Susan discussed old times, both happy and sad, and I <br/>
got to bear witness to it  all. We stamped into the box, and both Susan and <br/>
Ben signed our books and gave  us each their inky thumbprints as an <br/>
exchange. Mitch mentioned the  "Peacekeeper" label he had given her years before, <br/>
and she laughed and told me  about how all those boys really had needed a <br/>
mom. And both of them also talked  about letterboxing and what it has meant to <br/>
them over the years. The people,  the connections, the adventure, the <br/>
friends made and lost - and even how this  hobby and its members, as odd as it may <br/>
seem, has been a lifeline to some in  their times of grief. I will always, <br/>
always feel thankful for my opportunity  to sit and hear these stories. <br/>
<br/>
Now I'm not a person of faith. I'm not  even one to believe that <br/>
coincidence is anything more than random occurences  that we just happen to place <br/>
meaning on because they feel special. And I'm  certainly not inviting anyone to <br/>
try and convince me otherwise today. But I  just can't deny it;  something <br/>
was in the air there in Vermont for our  entire trip, and especially on that <br/>
day. When I think of everything that  needed to fall into place for us to be <br/>
visible from the road at that moment  that Susan and Ben were driving by, <br/>
for them to look over and recognize us as  letterboxers, and for them to take <br/>
the time out of their errands to stop and  say hello - all I can say is <br/>
that I believe in wonder that is letterboxing.  <br/>
<br/>
Because there's a reason this pasttime has taken hold so well. It goes  <br/>
beyond the fun of carving or writing clues, the thrill of the hike, the  <br/>
satisfaction of collecting images, the social and family fun. It's because  this <br/>
activity is a way for us to put our own special take on the world out  there <br/>
so others can see through our eyes - and so we can see through theirs.  It's <br/>
because carving these silly stamps and writing these silly clues is a  <br/>
wonderfully pure way to share a little bit of our souls with each other. And  <br/>
all I can say is, thank goodness that a few people who shared that early  <br/>
vision, as scattered about the country as they were, found each other and  <br/>
organized it all, so that the rest of us could have this outlet. Many of them  <br/>
have had the opportunity to meet over the years, but DMS had met very few -  <br/>
and watching him finally make those connections was like watching a very very <br/>
 special process that started over a decade ago finally come full circle.  <br/>

what a story and an adventure.<br/>
i think all my life i have been looking for something to belong to and to make my life have some sense to it and to have some sort of meaning.<br/>
i think it has been staring me in the face these past 4 years. <br/>
LETTERBOXING<br/>
i thought it was such an adventure for me to be at "Live and Breathe" and to be around so many letterboxers. to be part of something so silly as hiding tupperware in the woods and trying to find it again. geez..<br/>
but it all seems to make sense. this is where i belong. this is what i am suppose to be doing with myself. whether i am real active or part time active, doesnt matter. i still belong to this wonderful world of letterboxers. this wonderful family.<br/>
<br/>
and now to hear this amazing story of going "Back to our Roots" and for Mitch to meet all the friends he has made in his lifetime, and the biggest thrill of it all to meet Susan Davis??<br/>
Stamping inat the location of the first letterbox in the USA?<br/>
WOW!!! <br/>
what more can you say?<br/>

typing this with a lump in my throat.<br/>

Please forgive my longwindedness and please read this post if you have the time. I've been wanting to give my own take on mine and DMS's experiences in Vermont, but in all the drama of the last several days I've been worried it would get lost. Things seem to have blown over a bit, so I'd like to post it now. I'm sure Mitch considered writing about it himself, but I imagine his take on what happened might be so personal, he's had difficulty putting it into words. So as a third party observer, I thought I might give it a try - because it's a story worth sharing, one that I feel so lucky to have experienced, and one that I hope might touch some others as it did me. <br/>
<br/>
When DMS and I first heard about the Back to Our Roots Gathering, we'd already made our travel plans for the summer. We're leaving for a month-long road trip centered around vending at LB-Con in St. Louis, and our entire travel budget and vacation allotments for the YEAR had already been completely taken by these plans. So the answer to "Can we go?" Was an unequivocable "No!" But still, the possibility just nagged and nagged at Mitch and there wasn't a day that went by that he didn't utter the phrase "Man, I just wish there was some way we could make it work." <br/>
<br/>
You see, 10 years ago, when the first ever gathering happened in Killington, VT, Der Mad Stamper was, as I understand it, the only conspicuously absent member of that original founding American Clan of our now favorite pasttime. Oregon is a long way from Vermont and the travel distance was a lot easier for most of those other originators. So it was understandable, with Mark Pepe planning surprises up his sleeve, and with him also dropping plenty of hints that those surprises were actually his attempts to get as many of those early pioneers as possible to attend this anniversary gathering, that Mitch was a bit obsessed with the idea of somehow making it out.<br/>
<br/>
As the weeks passed, I became very aware that a hole created with his absence at that first gathering ten years ago was still sitting empty somewhere in his heart, and that perhaps, if we could just make it work, a trip to Back to Our Roots might just be what he needed to finally fill it in. So in spite of all the reasonable and financial reasons for why it was an awful idea, we found ways to tighten our belts and make the trip. Of course, Mark had sworn us to secrecy, keeping us from signing up on the AQ list or letting anyone know we were coming. We knew he must be doing the same to many of those other "old timers", but it was anyone's guess who might actually show up.<br/>
<br/>
DMS wondered aloud many times during the few weeks about who might be there. Who, among all of those he's formed lifelong bonds with, communicating only by computer, might he finally be able to attach a face and a smile to the personality he could only imagine he'd guessed at correctly? He mentioned Randy Hall, Tom Cooch, Silent Doug, Jay Drew, and several others I can't remember. He wondered especially about Susan Davis - the one he's always described to me as "The Peacekeeper" , the one who helped them all keep things in perspective when early debates between all those boys, including her husband Erik who's now passed away, turned petty.<br/>
<br/>
And what a gratifying gathering it was! There were so many wonderful friends to see again, and people to meet for the first time - those we thought would be there and those we hoped would, and so many others that weren't expected at all but who were just as delightful. Just to name a few: Choi, Silent Doug, Silver Eagle and Team Green Dragon (especially Brian, who must admit along with Mitch that they have shared as many snappish words as kind ones with each other over the years - it's about time those two found out thy might actually be able to get along!) And then there was Tom Cooch, who hasn't been around much in recent years, and who Mitch really only hoped wistfully might show up. And yet there he was, and the two hugged like old friends, even though they were meeting for the first time. I can only imagine he felt like he was surrounded by long lost family. And even though not every single one of those Killington Folk were able to make it - Susan<br/>
 Davis couldn't, and a few others too, there was enough magical experiences at that gathering to last a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
And I guess if you've gotten through all my babbling so far, it's time to tell you that all of this has really just been the lead-in to what was truly one of the most special moments I've ever witnessed in my lifetime: <br/>
<br/>
As Mitch mentioned in his own post a couple of days ago, outside of the actual gathering, we only made time for two (yes, two - I know it's pitiful!) letterboxes for the entire trip. That was my fault mostly - I have too-rarely-seen family in the area so the vacation was serving a dual purpose and we had other obligations to meet that week as well. But during the little free time we were able to devote to boxing, we made two decisions: get one box in Killington as we were passing through, since it was the site of the first gathering (we chose "James P. Taylor"), and get over to Bristol for the newly replaced "Prayer Rock". Well the Killington had its own wonderful rainy adventures, as Mitch has already described, but it was our finding of "Prayer Rock" that he seems to have chosen not to describe. Like I mentioned before, I can only imagine that his experience in finding the box that he really feels was the first one was personal to share with others.<br/>
 But it's such a wonderful story that, even though he doesn't know I'm doing so, I thought that perhaps my bystander account might be just as special without making him feel quite so exposed.<br/>
<br/>
It really was just a "find" like any other; a few compass readings and a confusion or two before the final moment of enlightment. We sat at a picnic table visible from the road, opened the box, looked through the too-short logbook wishing we could have seen the original, before spreading our inks and books out for a luxuriously slow stamping in process. There was even the all-too-common moment when another car pulled in and we discussed whether we should put away our mess, or at least consolidate it, before nosey tourists felt the need to ask us too many questions. Being a little lazier than we probably should be, we did none of these and left everything lying about, and I proceeded to ink up the stamp. The occupants of the car got out - a woman and a young man on the verge of adulthood. They started walking toward us, which wasn't so odd since our table lay between them and the infamous "Prayer Rock" that the clue is named for. But instead of a curious<br/>
 and polite nod as they walked by, they came up to us directly, and the woman looked blatantly over Mitch's shoulder at the stamp in my hands.

&gt; I figure you're probably very grateful for letterboxing &amp; for those people's first efforts -- am I wrong in that you would not have met Mitch otherwise?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; KuKu<br/>
<br/>
That's right, KuKu... and it brings to mind another subject that came up at the Back 2 Roots gathering... all the lives that have been touched by this hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Raqs and I are hardly the first couple to hook up because of letterboxing. In fact, I met about a dozen couples during B2R that had met as a result of letterboxing, and I know there are many others around the country.<br/>
<br/>
I recall talking to one particular couple who told me that letterboxing was the special "glue" that had united two very different people -- one who was an avid hiker and camper, and another who had a very indoorish crafty personality. Through letterboxing, they had learned to enjoy a bit of each other's lives.<br/>
<br/>
I also spoke to several people who had discovered that letterboxing can be a real lifesaver during hard times. I can certainly relate, because I personally managed to get through an ugly divorce and my younger sister's death from cancer by focusing on letterboxing. At B2R, I talked to other people who had gotten through similar situations by using letterboxing as a coping mechanism.<br/>
<br/>
Most notably, in the Prayer Rock scenario that Raqs describes, Susan Davis told us about how our early work to create the LbNA site had helped her get through the difficult period when Erik was going through chemotherapy. In fact, I have to get a little teary-eyed recalling her emotional account of how she would get up every morning and log onto this forum because she wanted to keep Erik's dream alive and see this project through until it reached critical mass and took on a life of its own.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I know there have also been several occasions where letterboxing has been used to help people who were in dire straits financially. This is a tradition that can be traced all the way back to Dartmoor, and I feel privileged to have taken part in several of these types of fund-raising events.<br/>
<br/>
Okay... I'm re-reading this message before sending, and realizing that it sounds pretty sappy. I suppose our trip to Vermont has understandably put me in a rather sentimental mood. I guess I'm just trying to make a point that letterboxing is not only a quirky hobby for a bunch of obsessive geeks but, as Raqs points out in her poignant post, it can also be a wonderful way for people to connect and share a bit of their souls with one another. Never has this been more obvious to me than at the B2R event.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mitch, a sentimental old fool<br/>
(also known as Der Mad Stamper)<br/>

Please  forgive my longwindedness and please read this post if you have the <br/>
<br/>
time. I've  been wanting to give my own take on mine and DMS's experiences <br/>
<br/>
in Vermont, but  in all the drama of the last several days I've been worried <br/>
<br/>
it would get lost.  Things seem to have blown over a bit, so I'd like to <br/>
<br/>
post it now. I'm sure  Mitch considered writing about it himself, but I <br/>
<br/>
imagine his take on what  happened might be so personal, he's had difficulty <br/>
<br/>
putting it into words. So  as a third party observer, I thought I might give it a <br/>
<br/>
try - because it's a  story worth sharing, one that I feel so lucky to have <br/>
<br/>
experienced, and one  that I hope might touch some others as it did me. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When DMS and I first  heard about the Back to Our Roots Gathering, we'd <br/>
<br/>
already made our travel  plans for the summer. We're leaving for a month-long <br/>
<br/>
road trip centered around  vending at LB-Con in St. Louis, and our entire <br/>
<br/>
travel budget and vacation  allotments for the YEAR had already been completely <br/>
<br/>
taken by these plans. So  the answer to "Can we go?" Was an unequivocable <br/>
<br/>
"No!" But still, the  possibility just nagged and nagged at Mitch and there <br/>
<br/>
wasn't a day that went  by that he didn't utter the phrase "Man, I just wish <br/>
<br/>
there was some way we  could make it work." <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You see, 10 years ago, when the first ever  gathering happened in <br/>
<br/>
Killington, VT, Der Mad Stamper was, as I understand it,  the only conspicuously <br/>
<br/>
absent member of that original founding American Clan  of our now favorite <br/>
<br/>
pasttime. Oregon is a long way from Vermont and the travel  distance was a lot <br/>
<br/>
easier for most of those other originators. So it was  understandable, with <br/>
<br/>
Mark Pepe planning surprises up his sleeve, and with him  also dropping plenty <br/>
<br/>
of hints that those surprises were actually his attempts  to get as many of <br/>
<br/>
those early pioneers as possible to attend this anniversary  gathering, <br/>
<br/>
that Mitch was a bit obsessed with the idea of somehow making it  out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As the weeks passed, I became very aware that a hole created with  his <br/>
<br/>
absence at that first gathering ten years ago was still sitting empty  somewhere <br/>
<br/>
in his heart, and that perhaps, if we could just make it work, a  trip to <br/>
<br/>
Back to Our Roots might just be what he needed to finally fill it in.  So in <br/>
<br/>
spite of all the reasonable and financial reasons for why it was an  awful <br/>
<br/>
idea, we found ways to tighten our belts and make the trip. Of course,  Mark <br/>
<br/>
had sworn us to secrecy, keeping us from signing up on the AQ list or  <br/>
<br/>
letting anyone know we were coming. We knew he must be doing the same to many  of <br/>
<br/>
those other "old timers", but it was anyone's guess who might actually show <br/>
<br/>
 up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DMS wondered aloud many times during the few weeks about who might  be <br/>
<br/>
there. Who, among all of those he's formed lifelong bonds with,  communicating <br/>
<br/>
only by computer, might he finally be able to attach a face and  a smile to <br/>
<br/>
the personality he could only imagine he'd guessed at correctly? He  <br/>
<br/>
mentioned Randy Hall, Tom Cooch, Silent Doug, Jay Drew, and several others I  can't <br/>
<br/>
remember. He wondered especially about Susan Davis - the one he's always  <br/>
<br/>
described to me as "The Peacekeeper" , the one who helped them all keep things  <br/>
<br/>
in perspective when early debates between all those boys, including her  <br/>
<br/>
husband Erik who's now passed away, turned petty.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And what a gratifying  gathering it was! There were so many wonderful <br/>
<br/>
friends to see again, and  people to meet for the first time - those we thought <br/>
<br/>
would be there and those  we hoped would, and so many others that weren't <br/>
<br/>
expected at all but who were  just as delightful. Just to name a few: Choi, <br/>
<br/>
Silent Doug, Silver Eagle and  Team Green Dragon (especially Brian, who must <br/>
<br/>
admit along with Mitch that they  have shared as many snappish words as kind <br/>
<br/>
ones with each other over the years  - it's about time those two found out <br/>
<br/>
thy might actually be able to get  along!) And then there was Tom Cooch, who <br/>
<br/>
hasn't been around much in recent  years, and who Mitch really only hoped <br/>
<br/>
wistfully might show up. And yet there  he was, and the two hugged like old <br/>
<br/>
friends, even though they were meeting for  the first time. I can only imagine <br/>
<br/>
he felt like he was surrounded by long lost  family. And even though not <br/>
<br/>
every single one of those Killington Folk were  able to make it - Susan Davis <br/>
<br/>
couldn't, and a few others too, there was enough  magical experiences at that <br/>
<br/>
gathering to last a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I guess  if you've gotten through all my babbling so far, it's time to <br/>
<br/>
tell you that  all of this has really just been the lead-in to what was <br/>
<br/>
truly one of the most  special moments I've ever witnessed in my lifetime: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As Mitch mentioned  in his own post a couple of days ago, outside of the <br/>
<br/>
actual gathering, we only  made time for two (yes, two - I know it's pitiful!) <br/>
<br/>
letterboxes for the entire  trip. That was my fault mostly - I have <br/>
<br/>
too-rarely-seen family in the area so  the vacation was serving a dual purpose and <br/>
<br/>
we had other obligations to meet  that week as well. But during the little <br/>
<br/>
free time we were able to devote to  boxing, we made two decisions: get one <br/>
<br/>
box in Killington as we were passing  through, since it was the site of the <br/>
<br/>
first gathering (we chose "James P.  Taylor"), and get over to Bristol for <br/>
<br/>
the newly replaced "Prayer Rock". Well  the Killington had its own wonderful <br/>
<br/>
rainy adventures, as Mitch has already  described, but it was our finding of <br/>
<br/>
"Prayer Rock" that he seems to have  chosen not to describe. Like I <br/>
<br/>
mentioned before, I can only imagine that his  experience in finding the box that he <br/>
<br/>
really feels was the first one was  personal to share with others. But it's <br/>
<br/>
such a wonderful story that, even  though he doesn't know I'm doing so, I <br/>
<br/>
thought that perhaps my bystander  account might be just as special without <br/>
<br/>
making him feel quite so  exposed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It really was just a "find" like any other; a few compass  readings and a <br/>
<br/>
confusion or two before the final moment of enlightment. We sat  at a picnic <br/>
<br/>
table visible from the road, opened the box, looked through the  too-short <br/>
<br/>
logbook wishing we could have seen the original, before spreading  our inks <br/>
<br/>
and books out for a luxuriously slow stamping in process. There was  even the <br/>
<br/>
all-too-common moment when another car pulled in and we discussed  whether <br/>
<br/>
we should put away our mess, or at least consolidate it, before nosey  <br/>
<br/>
tourists felt the need to ask us too many questions. Being a little lazier  than <br/>
<br/>
we probably should be, we did none of these and left everything lying  <br/>
<br/>
about, and I proceeded to ink up the stamp. The occupants of the car got out -  a <br/>
<br/>
woman and a young man on the verge of adulthood. They started walking <br/>
<br/>
toward  us, which wasn't so odd since our table lay between them and the infamous <br/>
<br/>
 "Prayer Rock" that the clue is named for. But instead of a curious and <br/>
<br/>
polite  nod as they walked by, they came up to us directly, and the woman <br/>
<br/>
looked  blatantly over Mitch's shoulder at the stamp in my hands. Thinking <br/>
<br/>
perhaps  these two were just the investigative sort, I gave a polite hello, and <br/>
<br/>
waited  for the inevitable questions about what we were up to. But the first <br/>
<br/>
words she  uttered were an unexpected, "I've been wanting to see how the new <br/>
<br/>
carving  turned out." Realizing at last that these were fellow letterboxers, <br/>
<br/>
I asked in  reply, "Oh, did you have the opportunity to see the orignal?" <br/>
<br/>
To which the  young man standing behind her replied, "Yeah, she CARVED the  <br/>
<br/>
original."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was this moment that I made the connection, although  Mitch stayed oddly <br/>
<br/>
quiet, given who we were obviously, magically, sitting next  to. I asked <br/>
<br/>
what had to be asked though, "Are YOU Susan Davis?" to which she  humbly <br/>
<br/>
nodded a slight affirmative. (Mitch told us all later that his delay in  making <br/>
<br/>
the connection was because he was reacting internally to her carving  claim <br/>
<br/>
with the thought, "No you didn't! Susan Davis carved that stamp!") At  this <br/>
<br/>
point, the truth finally sunk in with DMS and he quite literally leaped  from <br/>
<br/>
his seat at the table, coming close to mauling the poor woman before he  <br/>
<br/>
seemed to realize that she had no idea who he was and looked momentarily  <br/>
<br/>
scared to death. So stopping mid-embrace and instead reaching out a hand for a  <br/>
<br/>
shake, he said "Susan, I'm Mitch. I'm Der Mad Stamper." Well her eyes got as <br/>
<br/>
 wide as his did moments before and I hope I'm not embarrassing either one <br/>
<br/>
of  them too badly by telling you all that they probably hugged for a solid <br/>
<br/>
3  minutes, tears and all! (I even took a sneaky picture.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When the  novelty of the situation finally abating, we all sat and had a <br/>
<br/>
truly beautiful  conversation. The young man turned out to be Benjamin, Erik <br/>
<br/>
and Susan's son  who had just graduated from high school a week earlier.  We <br/>
<br/>
showed them  the one other image of theirs that we had found the day before <br/>
<br/>
in Killington,  and Ben reminisced about how he, at 8 years old, had been <br/>
<br/>
the one to actually  do the hiding because he was the only one small enough to <br/>
<br/>
comfortably crawl  into its hiding spot (and yes, it had been a tight <br/>
<br/>
squeeze for us!). Mitch and  Susan discussed old times, both happy and sad, and I <br/>
<br/>
got to bear witness to it  all. We stamped into the box, and both Susan and <br/>
<br/>
Ben signed our books and gave  us each their inky thumbprints as an <br/>
<br/>
exchange. Mitch mentioned the  "Peacekeeper" label he had given her years before, <br/>
<br/>
and she laughed and told me  about how all those boys really had needed a <br/>
<br/>
mom. And both of them also talked  about letterboxing and what it has meant to <br/>
<br/>
them over the years. The people,  the connections, the adventure, the <br/>
<br/>
friends made and lost - and even how this  hobby and its members, as odd as it may <br/>
<br/>
seem, has been a lifeline to some in  their times of grief. I will always, <br/>
<br/>
always feel thankful for my opportunity  to sit and hear these stories. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm not a person of faith. I'm not  even one to believe that <br/>
<br/>
coincidence is anything more than random occurences  that we just happen to place <br/>
<br/>
meaning on because they feel special. And I'm  certainly not inviting anyone to <br/>
<br/>
try and convince me otherwise today. But I  just can't deny it;  something <br/>
<br/>
was in the air there in Vermont for our  entire trip, and especially on that <br/>
<br/>
day. When I think of everything that  needed to fall into place for us to be <br/>
<br/>
visible from the road at that moment  that Susan and Ben were driving by, <br/>
<br/>
for them to look over and recognize us as  letterboxers, and for them to take <br/>
<br/>
the time out of their errands to stop and  say hello - all I can say is <br/>
<br/>
that I believe in wonder that is letterboxing.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because there's a reason this pasttime has taken hold so well. It goes  <br/>
<br/>
beyond the fun of carving or writing clues, the thrill of the hike, the  <br/>
<br/>
satisfaction of collecting images, the social and family fun. It's because  this <br/>
<br/>
activity is a way for us to put our own special take on the world out  there <br/>
<br/>
so others can see through our eyes - and so we can see through theirs.  It's <br/>
<br/>
because carving these silly stamps and writing these silly clues is a  <br/>
<br/>
wonderfully pure way to share a little bit of our souls with each other. And  <br/>
<br/>
all I can say is, thank goodness that a few people who shared that early  <br/>
<br/>
vision, as scattered about the country as they were, found each other and  <br/>
<br/>
organized it all, so that the rest of us could have this outlet. Many of them  <br/>
<br/>
have had the opportunity to meet over the years, but DMS had met very few -  <br/>
<br/>
and watching him finally make those connections was like watching a very very <br/>
<br/>
 special process that started over a decade ago finally come full circle.  <br/>
