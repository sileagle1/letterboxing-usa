                    <div class="plaintext-content">Of all the things to count, exchanges are probably the most <br/>
controversial.  If there's a "family stamp" for three people, do you <br/>
count it as one or three?  If the dog has its own stamp, do you count <br/>
that?  What if someone makes a new signature stamp--should you count <br/>
every one of them or is it just one person per exchange?<br/>
<br/>
Nobody can agree on all of these points, so I've just stopped <br/>
counting exchanges.  Two different people could do the exact same <br/>
exchanges, and one will say they've done 50 exchanges while the other <br/>
counts it as 100.  There's so little consistency, it's staggering.<br/>
<br/>
As for event stamps, I only count one per event.  Then everyone knows <br/>
exactly how many events I've been to.  The event in SLO supposedly <br/>
had something like five event stamps (mostly traveling event stamps) <br/>
which I thought was riduculous and protested by not stamping into any <br/>
of them except the main event stamp designed specifically for this <br/>
event only.  =)  Probably didn't make a difference, but hey, I'm not <br/>
trying to win a race for acquiring the most stamps.  I just want a <br/>
count of how many events I've been to, not how many stamps I could <br/>
acquire.<br/>
