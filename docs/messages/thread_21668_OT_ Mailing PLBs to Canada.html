Hi folks.<br/>
<br/>
Please forgive me if you see this posted on a few boards, but the <br/>
information is important, especially now that there are folks from <br/>
other countries than the USA involved - namely Canada, UK, AUS, NZ <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
I was recently the recipient of a superb PLB mailed to me from NY. <br/>
Even though the mailer was only 90 Mi from me as the crow flies, the <br/>
box took almost 2 weeks to get here via USPS and Canada Post. The <br/>
reason? An incorrectly filled out customs declaration. <br/>
<br/>
The sender had filled out the corect customs slip for a small parcel <br/>
(the little green one). However, instead of marking the PLB as <br/>
a "gift" (no monies ever exchange hands), she marked it as "Other" <br/>
then wrote in "hobby/gift". She then put in a declared value of $30 <br/>
USD  which exchanges to about $36 CAD, and requires duty to be paid, <br/>
plus tax, plus a $5 handling fee. The end result was that what <br/>
should have been a $3 parcel ended up costing almost $14.<br/>
<br/>
Some simple rules for mailing to Canada:<br/>
<br/>
Keep the package as streamlined as possible - Canada Post goes by <br/>
size and weight. I recently attempted to mail a 7 oz PLB 53 miles <br/>
down the road only to find out that it would cost me almost $7 <br/>
because of the box size. However, I placed the PLB contents in a <br/>
padded envelope and it cost $1.16<br/>
<br/>
There is no such thing as Priority Post or Delivery Confirmation to <br/>
Canada. In addition, insurance, should you so desire it, is VERY <br/>
expensive, and frankly, not worth the money. There IS such an animal <br/>
called Global Priority, but my experience is that it's pretty steep -<br/>
 $7 and up, depending on size/weight etc. and would probably be <br/>
better suited if you were sending a bunch of items along (keep the <br/>
packaging sinple)<br/>
<br/>
The average rate of the PLBs I have received from the US is anywhere <br/>
from $1.06 to $3.10 for regular delivery (about 3-6 days, depending <br/>
on distance). Dont be misled by postal folks saying surface mail <br/>
takes 4 to 6 weeks (sure it does - if you're say..walking to <br/>
Botswana!)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps, and clears up some misconceptions/misgivings folks <br/>
may have. <br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions at all, please feel free to write me.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Pete aka Jiggs<br/>
