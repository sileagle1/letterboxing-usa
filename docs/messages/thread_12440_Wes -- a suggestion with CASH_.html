Indeed!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ..add a checkbox next to every listed box ... "Show all unfound<br/>
&gt; boxes," ...<br/>
<br/>
I'll second the motion, and offer to help if you want.<br/>
I'm a .net/ASP/ADO.net/MS SQL Server developer.<br/>
<br/>
...or perhaps sweeten the deal :)<br/>
I'll be happy to send you a check as a 'thank you' for all the work<br/>
you did rewriting the site to support a database, and the ability for<br/>
all of us to add/edit our own boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else interested?  Just something small like a few dollars a<br/>
family for those 'heavy boxers' that will really use the site a lot...<br/>

Before everyone whips out their checkbooks, I'd like to point out <br/>
that there are several other volunteers who have put in much time and <br/>
effort to make LbNA what it is today.  Not to diminish Wes's <br/>
monumental efforts, but I would hate to think that some volunteer who <br/>
has worked hard behind the scenes, but who has not had a high profile <br/>
on this list, might be overlooked.  Can anyone think of a fair way to <br/>
thank them all?<br/>

There could be the "Wes Box", "LbNA Webmaster's Box" etc. <br/>
<br/>
Hey, all you web guys and gals, and Wes, what are your favorite<br/>
things, food, animals, words, smells, places.  Everyone interested<br/>
could pick one and plant it with a dedication page in the front of<br/>
the log book.<br/>
<br/>
It's not cash but I think it would be a great way to honor someone.<br/>
