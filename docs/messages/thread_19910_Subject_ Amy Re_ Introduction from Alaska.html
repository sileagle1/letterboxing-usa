What a coincidence.  I have some friends coming to<br/>
Juneau on a cruise ship with their daughter next week.<br/>
 I am meeting them and we are going up the tram and<br/>
around town to see the sights.  The last letterbox is<br/>
up the tram on Mt. Roberts, I hope to get them hooked<br/>
on LB.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if you are all on the same cruise, LOL.  <br/>
<br/>
I carved another stamp last night and I think I am now<br/>
addicted to stamp carving as well.  There is no reason<br/>
not to get started so I think I am going to plant a lb<br/>
today!  : )  <br/>

Hi Amy in Alaska,<br/>
<br/>
We are going on a cruise the last week in August. I<br/>
have played with <br/>
the idea <br/>
of hiding a box up there but wasn't sure because I<br/>
won't be around to <br/>
maintenance it. But now I see you need more. I will<br/>
try to get one done <br/>
before we <br/>
leave.<br/>
<br/>
I sympathize with you. Our town only ad 4 when I<br/>
started this spring <br/>
but we <br/>
are up to about a dozen now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Dorie (Butterfly Stamper)<br/>
<br/>
