<br/>
Yes indeed.  Think of the "what's new" link as a queue for boxes that <br/>
are patiently waiting for their respective hardworking volunteer <br/>
webmasters to place them in their permanent form on the Main site. <br/>
I've noticed that boxes I've listed are usually placed within a few <br/>
days to a week.  But sometimes it may take longer if the webmaster is <br/>
extremely busy or perhaps away on vacation - maybe even letterboxing!<br/>
