For example, when driving 10+ hours to Ohio next month, I plan to <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content"> It's possible that Geocachers are in a younger average age than letterboxers and are more apt to go off trails for things just out of principal. I.E. one cache in Deer creek is located on an Island that requires wading across a stream, something letterboxers are not likely to do, although I would. I'm planning on hiding a box in my favorite cave in WVa this year even though I doubt very few will visit it.<br/>
<br/>
 By far I prefer boxes on trails to those that are located in busy places or parking lots, I absolutlely hate being observed. I've been bothered by police or patrolmen three times, an irate caretaker once and have had several run-ins with trail trolls. I waited for a mailman to get off his lunch break so I could get a box only to have someone decide that the location would be a good place to clean their car when I was trying to put it back.<br/>
<br/>
 My busiest box is a driveby tribute to WWI ace Eddie Rickenbacker while my least visited ones are on Sugarloaf mountain, one of the hills featured in Ohio's State seal.<br/>
<br/>
 However, I may not walk five miles for one box but I would if there more than one but that depends on where I am at the time.<br/>

It seems like now that the kids are grown and I have learned to loathe organized 'exercise'  and need to find what I call 'incidental exercise' or 'exercise with a pleasureable purpose'. LBing fills that bill rather well.  My LBing pal and I logged 12 hours yesterday! Wild goose chases galore, washed out trails, re-routed trails (alas clues not updated to match), mosquito attacks, ticks, obscure clues, and only 10 box finds, but to have first finds in three states - and all the views - WOW!   So worth it!<br/>
<br/>
The Capital District of NY State is so convenient a location for day trips to so may varied locations, it's a treasure in itself. Within a 3 hour drive I can be in the deep wilderness or Times Square or even in another country! Now that it is nearly Spring in the nearby Adirondacks, Green Mountains, White Mountains, and Catskills - we will be doing the longer hikes!<br/>
<br/>
So, keep planting them Baker, we will eventually get there!<br/>
