We would like to remind you of this upcoming event.<br/>
<br/>
Going Fishing for LetterboxeRs in Idaho <br/>
<br/>
Date: Sunday, July 10, 2005 <br/>
Time: 4:00PM - 7:00PM EDT (GMT-04:00) <br/>
<br/>
Gone FISHING for letterboxeRs lately?<br/>
<br/>
This is the perfect time to meet some letterboxeRs in Idaho.<br/>
You'll<br/>
have some FISHY letterboxes to find as well. The theme is<br/>
anything<br/>
FISHY. Can you smell it? So if you like, dress like a FISH, flop<br/>
like a FISH, bring FISHY food, or whatever you FISH like. It<br/>
might<br/>
not have to taste FISHY, but how about look FISHY, or feel<br/>
FISHY?<br/>
Bring some tasty FISH snacks/drinks for others to enjoy. Get<br/>
your<br/>
scales ready as you won't want to miss out on all the FISH fun.<br/>
<br/>
Is this event FISHY enough for even J-Bear to attend?<br/>
<br/>
Bring your friends and family and meet other letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
An option is to forget the FISH altogether, and come as you are,<br/>
but<br/>
remember your letterboxing logbook and stamp to exchange with<br/>
others. Dare you bring a HitchHiker to exchange in the hostel.<br/>
Go<br/>
FISH!<br/>
