                    <div class="plaintext-content">On February 10, 2003 Funhog placed the Happy Javelina Letterbox near Tucson, Pima County, Arizona. <br/>
Although hogs and javelinas are not really in the same family I consider this pig-like creature to be one of my <br/>
distant cousins and decided it needed to be recognized with a letterbox of its own. It should take 30-40 <br/>
minutes to reach the letterbox, depending on how many wrong turns you take. The trail to this box is rough in <br/>
places and not well marked. Beware of the evil Jumping Cholla along the trail. I was kissed by one and will not <br/>
soon forget my antics removing the sturdy spines from my calf.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: Head west out of Tucson on Speedway Blvd. Follow signs toward the Arizona-Sonora Desert <br/>
Museum. Shortly after you pass a sign welcoming you to Tucson Mountain Park, you will come to a scenic <br/>
overlook on your right. Park here and look for the trailhead by the bike racks in the upper parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: This trail will take you deep into a desert canyon that ends at a saddle between rocky <br/>
promontories. When you are almost to the saddle, the trail forks. Go to the left. From the saddle, you have a <br/>
commanding view of the Avra Valley and the mountains beyond. From the middle of the trail, center the asphalt <br/>
parking lot of Old Tucson Studios midway between two tall saguaros. The letterbox is about eight steps behind <br/>
you, hidden in a small pile of rocks.<br/>
