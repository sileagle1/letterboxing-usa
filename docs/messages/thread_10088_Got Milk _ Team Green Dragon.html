                    <html><body><div><div>Hi Brian and all the Green Dragon members. Got Milk is roadside and usually quite accesible. I think you would have to  walk in the snow bank but it is only 1-2 steps, high winds could create Artic conditions but you could dive back into your car. The view is magnificent with the snow outlining the hills. Do let me know if you are coming and I will try to arrange a time so you can get the Stearns Family housebox.  ( My house) . There is 7-8 inches of snow here  at present with a little crust in the middle. I could recommend a day of easier to do considering the weather   boxes. Such as KJ's Best, General Store,  Under the Pines, Population, Daybreak, John Storrs,  I could get a bunch more but these are especially easy for a snowy day with two serving hot food and beverages.  Tempted?  Come on over, Carol - Leader of the Pack</div></div><br clear="all"/><hr/> <a href="http://g.msn.com/8HMJEN/2015">get 2 months FREE*</a> </body></html>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">yo . all you Green Dragons. In Ct. Leader of the Pack is giving you a<br/>
great idea. They are all easy in the snow,  with even good food tossed<br/>
in, as she says. However  I would question her house box right now<br/>
unless she has a path dug to it !! I mean, they have SNOW. Now on the<br/>
other hand, come on over to the shore at Waterford and Niantic. We have<br/>
lots of boxes now,  and no snow as of yesterday.! Plus the roof of the<br/>
Gazibo was delivered Sunday night in the dark, so you can begin at the<br/>
top and build down, unconventional building practice but will work with<br/>
this magical Gazibo. Have a Butterfly Day!!<br/>

Well it seems as the House box has taken up a winter residence which <br/>
should be easier to get too. The original spot would be a bit of a <br/>
wet adventure.  And what's  in the forecast...... snow. Warm up the <br/>
shovels here we go.   Leader of the Pack in- what's a little digging <br/>

Carolyn, Thank you so much for the invite to pick up this special <br/>
house stamp ( I heard there was one but had no idea where.) <br/>
Unfortunately we will not be in that area this weekend. I'm working <br/>
on a special charity stamp inspired by BeMa (Msg. #20767). It will <br/>
help to combat a disease which has greatly effected my family. And we <br/>
have planned to leave it in a certain location in the opposite <br/>
direction of CT. I hope maybe we could take you up on your offer in <br/>
the future. <br/>
<br/>
Thank You<br/>
<br/>
Brian<br/>

here and even more by then. Carol - Leader of the Pack <br/>
