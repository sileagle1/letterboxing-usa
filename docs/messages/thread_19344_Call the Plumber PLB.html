a clogged shower drain!  Thank goodness he showed up....he's very <br/>
helpful and is conscientious about hiding the infamous "plumber's <br/>
butt" from the rest of us!  Sadly, however, he arrived while my <br/>
husband and I were on vacation so I found him kicked back on my <br/>
couch; beer in one hand, remote in the other.  The beer is running <br/>
out so he'll be on his way on Tuesday!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails,<br/>
