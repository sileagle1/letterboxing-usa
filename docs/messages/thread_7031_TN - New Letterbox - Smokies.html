Nearest town: Gatlinburg, TN - Townsend, TN<br/>
Smoky Mtns<br/>

Planted by: Mountain Mudbug &amp; Tiger Shark<br/>
August 17, 2002 (in pouring rain)<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty - easy<br/>
Distance - 3/4 mile loop trail<br/>
<br/>
Enter the Smoky Mtns Park and pick up a trail/road map at one <br/>
of the wonderful visitor centers, and don't miss their great exhibits.<br/>
<br/>
Locate Elkmont campground on the north-central side of the park. <br/>
Drive to the campground itself, but do not enter.  Instead, turn left <br/>
and drive 0.3 miles, turn left again into the Elkmont Nature Trail <br/>
parking lot. Park, take a brochure, and begin your search!<br/>
<br/>
(Note: This is a small box.  Please bring your own ink pad and <br/>
writing utensils, and a tissue to clean the box-stamp after use.<br/>
Thanks!)<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Over the footbridge, watch your step.<br/>
Follow the numbers which go to your left.<br/>
Up the hill, down again. Through clearings,<br/>
past ferns, tip-toe cross streams.<br/>
To 6 you go, the trail turns left.<br/>
So do you, continue your quest.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the path, over footbridge #2, on you go.<br/>
Careful, don't slip, you're almost there!<br/>
Onward to the faint fork in the trail.<br/>
Between two trees you'll make your move.<br/>
Numbered trail rises through crooked trees<br/>
to left.  Don't go there yet, go right instead.<br/>
Others as curious have ventured this way, <br/>
but it goes nowhere certain to say.<br/>
<br/>
About 65 "normal" steps, 'til two fallen trees.<br/>
Stop at the first, the exposed root-ball's the key.<br/>
While straddling the trunk you look at the roots,<br/>
On the right-hand edge is stashed the loot!<br/>
Under some branches, beneath some bark,<br/>
You'll find the Letterbox, stamping now starts! <br/>
<br/>
Repack the box, neat and clean, return to its<br/>
nest beside the tree.  Hide it well, be very discreet,<br/>
our secret is safe, your quest is complete.<br/>
Retrace your steps and finish the trail,<br/>
Back to your house and send us e-mail!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
