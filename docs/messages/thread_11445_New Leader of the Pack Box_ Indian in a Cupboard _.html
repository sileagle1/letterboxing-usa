<p><span>Bolton Notch , Ct.</span></p>
<p><span>Rated :Medium – Hard : 
Difficult scramble up straight. Short distance . Broken glass on path possible 
Don’t recommend dogs at this one.  On highway  edge- hold children’s 
hands at all times.  Is a hangout and party spot at times. Be sure to  
replace box and cover stones so it doesn’t show. </span></p>

By: Leader of the Pack, Cowboy and Cody</span></p>
<p><span>Read the Book Series; Box 
1</span></p>
<p><span>Bring a 
Flashlight!!!</span></p>
<p><span>Road Directions: At the 
junctions of 384 / 44/ &amp; 6 ,  From Rte 44  east of Bolton come to 
the light at the shopping plaza. Proceed and pull off under the billboard on the 
right and park.  From 6 east is a little more difficult you join  
44  right at the pull off spot  it is safer to go up the road get off 
at the first exit come around to go east and go to  just before the light 
to a change of direction loop.  From 384 or 4 heading east out of 
Manchester follow to the rte 6 and 44 split. Stay in left lane follow to 
underpass just after that is the  change of direction loop that will bring 
you around to the  billboard. </span></p>
<p><span></span> </p>
<p><span>     You 
are going to climb to Squaw’s Cave. This cave has a legend. Long ago when this 
was a land of  fish filled rivers ,great game to hunt and peaceful tribes. 
Local tribes came to the great notch in the rocks to fish and hunt. Some knew of 
the cave on the hillside and used its refuge in bad weather. Then came the men 
of white skin and they hunted and fished and cleared trees and the land was 
changing. A disagreement broke out between a brave and the white men . The brave 
was wounded and the white men were tracking  him. His squaw or wife took 
him and hid him in the cave in hope to mend his wounds in peace. There was 
water, food and shelter here and they were safe.  It was not to be, and 
within days the Brave died. Ever since the cave has been referred to  by 
locals as Squaw’s Cave. </span></p>
<p><span>     From 
your parking spot under the billboard walk along the road edge carefully – hold 
children’s hand! Just after the Speed Limit sign you will see the unmarked 
trail  going up the hill. It begins to the left a bit then switches back to 
the right. It is almost straight up  muddy in places too.  You will 
see the cave entrance ( you can see it from the road too).  Inside the cave 
about five feet in on the right there is a crevice about 4 feet up at arm length 
the box is hidden under some small flat stone.  Take it out into the light 
to <u>read</u> <u>the book well</u>.  Please  when replacing the box 
MAKE SURE IT IS COVERED WELL SO IT CAN’T BE SEEN THIS IS A PARTY 
SPOT!</span></p>
<p><span></span> </p>
<p><span>Hope you find the extra effort 
we put into this one. Be very careful when descending the hill it is steep, 
slippery and muddy at times.</span></p>
