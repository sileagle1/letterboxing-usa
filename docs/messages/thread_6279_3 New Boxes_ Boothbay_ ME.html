Letterbox Location: Lincoln County, Maine<br/>
Nearest Town: Boothbay, ME<br/>
Planted on: 9 July 2002<br/>
Planted by: Shipwright<br/>
<br/>
As of July, 2002: The Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens is a relatively <br/>
new institution; new trail systems are being built, and the old ones <br/>
being blazed. Don't be misled from your appointed trail! Also, please <br/>
stay on the trails as much as possible. I have tried to make my <br/>
letterboxes in this area either close to the trail, or off the trail <br/>
in an area that will not be drastically damaged by light foot-<br/>
traffic. Be respectful of the ground-cover and of the potential for <br/>
soil erosion.<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:<br/>
"From Rt. 1 take Rt. 27 to Boothbay Center Monument. Bear right onto <br/>
Corey Lane. Take next right, Barter's Island Road. Coastal Maine <br/>
Botanical Gardens is one mile on the left."<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
Begin your search on the northernmost entrance to the Shore Trail. <br/>
Follow this trail through the woods, pasta fern garden on the right, <br/>
and over a footbridge. Take the opportunity to calibrate your paces  <br/>
there are four between each vertical rail on the bridge (the <br/>
Shipwright has a short stride!). As the trail bends directly after <br/>
the footbridge, look for a mossy rise on the left. The Flying Bird <br/>
letterbox nests beneath a fallen log upon this mossy stone.<br/>
<br/>
Return to the trail. At the next fork, follow it to the northwest, <br/>
passing two cairns on the right  add a stone if you're so inclined. <br/>
At the second of these cairns, notice two standing stones through the <br/>
trees at 170 degrees. The Moon-on-the-River Letterbox gazes skyward <br/>
within an opened pine, ten paces at 180 degrees from the larger of <br/>
these standing stones.<br/>
<br/>
Return again to the Shore Walk trail, following it along the river <br/>
and around a bend or two. As you return inland, you will see an old <br/>
pine tree on the left, perched upon granite. Find a tapering gap <br/>
between rock and tree. The White Pine Letterbox rests its roots here.<br/>
