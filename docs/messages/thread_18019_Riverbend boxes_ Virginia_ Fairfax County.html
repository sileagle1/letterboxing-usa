Gruff is gone; if I decide to replace it, it will not be at the bridge, since that is <br/>
clearly too exposed. The others: Possum Trot, Muscrat Ramble, SpryngFlyng, <br/>
Who Cooks For You? and Bees Knees are in place and in good condition. <br/>
Thanks to all of you visitors who rehid them carefully. A couple of boxes were <br/>
left fairly exposed. I implore all you loyal letterboxers with children: Giving <br/>
them the job of rehiding is GREAT, but the process should be supervised by a <br/>
responsible adult. Please, guys, if a box was hidden under a rock, be sure the <br/>
rock is replaced on top of the box, not the reverse! I count on rocks to keep the <br/>
forest critters away. Thank you!<br/>
