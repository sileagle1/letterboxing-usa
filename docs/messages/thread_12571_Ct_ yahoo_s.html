Upstream Uphill . Actually we yelled , danced and yes, yahooed all the <br/>
way back to the car.  We thought we were so smart,  even though it was <br/>
our third try for that box.  That is a wonderful mystery and if you are <br/>
into mysteries, sit down and figure that one out.  Of course you must <br/>
find The Books first  ;-)  and a few other treasures, but signing into <br/>
that book and stamping another beautiful stamp of Jay Drews into our log <br/>
book, just made the day  for us.Sort of like frosting on the cake , nice <br/>
thick frosting, yummy frosting !! Do I sound happy :-D We started out <br/>
our boxing day at 7 this morning, and ended like that.  Does it get any <br/>
better ??<br/>
Hope you are happy too.<br/>
