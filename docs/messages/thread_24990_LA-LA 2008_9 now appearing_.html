                    <div class="plaintext-content">"Extra, Extra - Read all about it! " Ladies and Gentlemen,  this way to the "Big Top" to see <br/>
the long-awaited "Lifetime Achievement Letterboxing Award" nominees for 2008/2009! <br/>
Those who may remember from past years know that this special "letterboxing award" is a <br/>
sort of historical record of those who have seriously (or not so seriously!;) dedicated <br/>
themselves to our delightful little hobby well beyond the "call of duty" for five or more <br/>
years, planted 100 or more letterboxes and have a combined PFX over 500, or are well on <br/>
their way to attaining those goals!<br/>
<br/>
We realize that nowadays that last number may not seem very impressive at all, when <br/>
folks can get 500 "stamp images" in a single month just by doing drive-bys, going to a <br/>
couple of stamp-swap gatherings or even just going on-line or out to their mailboxes! <br/>
However, we're going back to a time that predates any of those latter day "stamp <br/>
collecting" manifestations, or SWOH, as we call it (short for "Stamps Without Hikes"). We're <br/>
talking here  about a time when going out on hunts for a few hundred individual letterbox <br/>
finds or meeting even a few dozen fellow letterboxers represented a HUGE challenge, so <br/>
PFX 500 back then was very impressive indeed!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, we actually started a PFX500 Club back in 2001 that can still be seen <br/>
on our web page at http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html#pfxclubs    We still <br/>
remember how at the time some folks were rather disgruntled about it, thinking that it <br/>
would be almost impossible to achieve that status, since there were scarcely that many <br/>
letterboxes in the whole country back then! Well, just look at where we are with North <br/>
American letterboxing now, tens of  thousands of letterboxes and many PFX Club members <br/>
later! <br/>
<br/>
Yes, we  certainly have had many letterboxers "join the club" since then, and although we <br/>
don't advertise it much any more, since some of the newer folks seem to have difficulty <br/>
distinguishing between what constitutes  letterboxing and what is just "stamp collecting", <br/>
we are still happy to recruit new members!  All we ask, in fairness to those for whom <br/>
achieving those numbers represented a real effort, is that none of the recent "new-<br/>
fangled stamp stuff" like personal travelers, postals, virtuals, tabletoppers, cooties and <br/>
other such SWOH from gatherings be included in the count, because those things simply <br/>
did not exist at the time these clubs were established!  Of course, some of the members in <br/>
more recent times may have some of that "stamp collecting"/ "non-letterboxing stuff" <br/>
already "grandfathered" into their counts, but for anyone else who  might care to join up, <br/>
please just send us the date you reached any particular level of what in some new circles <br/>
is now being called "traditional letterboxing" (but which is just plain letterboxing to us!), <br/>
and we'll be glad to add your name to the list!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, to get back now to those folks who have received or will soon be up for our <br/>
"Lifetime Achievement  Letterboxing Award", yes, historically many of these folks have <br/>
represented  important influences on our hobby here in North America, many are in our <br/>
PFX clubs, and we are certainly happy to honor them with our "Lil' Oscar" ! ( Remembering, <br/>
of course, that it's the thought, not the stamp, that counts!;-) Sorry it has taken us so long <br/>
to get organized this time to "roll out the red carpet" - or perhaps  we should say in <br/>
keeping with  this year's theme "the big top tent"! The first couple of years we announced <br/>
the "LA-LA" in October, last year we didn't get around to it until Thanksgiving, and this <br/>
time we couldn't even quite manage to get it ready for Epiphany! However, the advantage <br/>
in waiting this long this time is that the "LA-LA" can now span two years, and since we're <br/>
getting pretty shaky on remembering just exactly when some folks started and how many <br/>
boxes they have actually planted (seeing just how many people and how many boxes there <br/>
are in the hobby by now!), this is an advantage indeed! As we explain in this season's "LA-<br/>
LA" itself, it's easier now to just have folks tell us when they've got their 5 years and <br/>
eligible counts in, and we'll take it from there!  Also, as we've said in years past, please let <br/>
us know if there is anyone we've forgotten, as we would like to make this as accurate a <br/>
portrayal of "highly significant letterboxers" through the years as we can, and have it be of <br/>
some historic interest to newcomers to the hobby as well! <br/>
<br/>
By the way, speaking of things  that might be of interest to new letterboxers, we mention <br/>
towards the end of this season's LALA how "log-ins" themselves are only a fairly recent <br/>
phenomenon in North American letterboxing history, and are definitely not the <br/>
"requirement" that some newbies seem to assume them to be!  We also mention how <br/>
happy we were to see some letterboxers returning some of that old "mystique" to the <br/>
hobby by going back to the longtime standard practice of keeping their finds private, only <br/>
available in their own lists/logbooks or to  those who actually went out actively <br/>
letterboxing and found out who had visited where for themselves!  Well, imagine our <br/>
delight when we went out to check on one of our own RI boxes just yesterday afternoon, <br/>
thinking that with all the new people these days doing the "public log-in thing", it had <br/>
probably not yet been visited... only to find out that there had already been over a dozen <br/>
visitors, and not a single "public logger" among the bunch! What a wonderful surprise - <br/>
now THAT, to us at least, is what letterboxing is really about!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here it is  - "LALA 2008-2009":<br/>

haul) boxer, I just want to say thanks for the inspiration.   I'm not<br/>
even near 100.  Seeing this list gives me something to shoot for<br/>
(although I suspect it will take a few years to get there).   I am<br/>
amazed at the number who have stuck it out for long enough to get that<br/>
high of a count and to see those who have achieved the higher<br/>
categories is very inspiring.  Thanks for taking the time to put this<br/>
list together.<br/>
