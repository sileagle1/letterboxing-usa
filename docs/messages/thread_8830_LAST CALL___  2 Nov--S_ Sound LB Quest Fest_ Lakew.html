1st Annual <br/>
<br/>
WA South Sound Letterbox Quest Fest<br/>
<br/>
When: Sat, 2 Nov 02<br/>
<br/>
Time: 10am-late afternoon<br/>
<br/>
Location: Fort Steilacoom Park in Lakewood, WA <br/>
<br/>
Who: Fellow LB enthusiasts from far &amp; wide (newbies most welcome, <br/>
too)<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~ <br/>
<br/>
IMPORTANT: WE WILL MEET AT A NEW, SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT, LOCATION IN <br/>
THE PARK THAT HAS MORE PICNIC TABLES &amp; IS CLOSER TO THE PARKING <br/>
LOT!!! SEE MESSAGE BELOW FOR SPECIFICS DIRECTIONS!!!<br/>
<br/>
*****~~~~~*****<br/>

attend, we have over 30 people who will be there!!! <br/>
<br/>
*****~~~~~*****<br/>
<br/>
FOOD: Mid-morning Potluck! ;) Potluck from 10am-12pm noon (bring <br/>
enough food/drinks and appropriate supplies for the number of folks <br/>
in your group). Many folks are bringing warm dishes such as chili, <br/>
dips, hearty soups--presuming it will be brisk &amp; cold on Saturday. <br/>
<br/>
FACILITIES: Honey buckets, port-a-johns, portapotties is all I can <br/>
find in the park--might want to bring your own Charmin. ;) I can't <br/>
seem to find any water fountains, either--so please bring water &amp; <br/>
refreshments with you. I didn't find any electrical outlets, <br/>
either. :( Perhaps someone has a portable generator they can bring <br/>
or a vehicle that provides AC or DC power? <br/>
<br/>
EVENT LETTERBOXES: Please post your clues to the website NLT 7pm <br/>
Friday evening (1 Nov 02) so folks who are traveling long distances <br/>
have a chance to print the clues before they depart OR bring several <br/>
sets of copies of your clues to distribute during the event. If you <br/>
choose to bring your clues, please post your clues to the message <br/>
board after the event if you intend to leave your LB in the park <br/>
permanently thereafter.<br/>
<br/>
DON'T FORGET TO PLAN FOR NW WEATHER--THIS EVENT WILL GO ON RAIN OR <br/>
SHINE!!!<br/>
