&gt; I think I'll just continue to letterbox but not sign into anyone's <br/>
&gt; logbook. I can still collect images in my book. I don't need to leave <br/>
&gt; my mark anywhere. Then no one will know if I've visited their box and <br/>
&gt; won't have to worry that I'll "ruin" their box by possibly putting it <br/>
&gt; in a database. <br/>
<br/>
What???<br/>
I think this totally disregards the entire point of letterboxing<br/>
altogether. It would be extremely unfortunate if the only reason to<br/>
box is to find and report and not sign the log.<br/>
<br/>
I can say that I've signed into books that DON'T EVEN HAVE STAMPS!<br/>
How's that for a FIND????? What the heck would you report then? <br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
One of the prime reasons that I box (personally) is to HIKE and GET<br/>
OUTDOORS for the FUN of it and when it's not fun anymore - forget it.<br/>
When the box isn't there - who cares??! Move on, find another, come<br/>
back a few more times, heck - come back 10more times maybe you'll<br/>
never find it, but you'll get some good exercise trying.<br/>
