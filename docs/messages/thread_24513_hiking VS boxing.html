where you're more than a little disappointed if one is missing or un- <br/>

deciding to be disappointed, then complaining that you're  <br/>
disappointed. We all know that boxes will be elusive, whether it's  <br/>
because we can't figure out the clue or because an animal has dragged  <br/>
the box off. That's part of the deal. Yes, letterboxing is different  <br/>
from hiking, but it's not at all likely that any LBer will go for too  <br/>
long without coming off a trail with an Attempted instead of a  <br/>
Find..... It's our choice how to handle that and allowing it to  <br/>
frustrate you too much instead of making it a fleeting twinge may be  <br/>
a sign that you'd prefer a more certain hobby. No biggie.<br/>

It's all about the stamp for me.  The stamp image is NOT just the physical<br/>
memory for me.  It's NOT about the journey for me.  I journey all the time<br/>
without needing a stamp image for the memory.<br/>
<br/>
What WE'VE done is to give ourselves a booby prize.  We figure out a booby<br/>
prize before we head out.  For example, if it's 110 degrees in the shade, we<br/>
might decide that if we DON'T find the box, we'll stop afterwards for two of<br/>
the biggest chocolate sundaes we can possibly find.  Or we might stop off<br/>
for a swim at the health club even tho we really don't have the time.  Or we<br/>
might buy concert tickets we might otherwise consider skipping due to the<br/>
cost.  Etc.  And if we find the box(s), then NO booby prize.  Because a<br/>
booby prize doesn't mean anything if it's not a booby prize.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
And, as some other poster suggested, nope, sorry, I don't need to find<br/>
another interest.  I'm just peachy keen happy with letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
If an author I normally love suddenly puts out a novel that I feel is far<br/>
less than their normal talent, am I disappointed?  Sure.  Will I stop<br/>
reading their books?  Nope.  The next one might be right back up there<br/>
talent-wise.<br/>
<br/>
If I'm handling my dog poorly at an agility competition and don't qualify on<br/>
the agility course, am I disappointed?  Sure.  Seriously so.  Has it kept me<br/>
off agility courses?  Nope.  At least not in a few decades yet.  The next<br/>
trial I just might have my act together and we get a great score.<br/>
<br/>
If someone from another state emails me and asks me to photograph the<br/>
tombstone of an ancestor and I get to the cemetery to find stones badly<br/>
vandalised, including the one I set out to photograph, am I disappointed?<br/>
Sure.  Does it stop me from trying to help the next person who emails me?<br/>
Nope.  The next request might find THAT stone to be absolutely beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
If the next Johnny Depp movie is a dud, will I be disappointed?  Sure.  Will<br/>
that stop me from going to his movies?  Nope.  His next movie might be<br/>
fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
Why do some folks see it to be so absolutely horrible to be disappointed<br/>
once in a while?   That doesn't mean a person doesn't get over it and move<br/>
on.  Ya get disappointed......ya might vent about it some.........ya move<br/>
on.  If a letterboxer committed suicide over a box not found, OK, there<br/>
might be something wrong with THAT picture.  But there's nothing wrong with<br/>
being disappointed.<br/>

I suspect that the poster you're referring to is me. I actually think  <br/>
you and I are on similar wavelengths on this. I did not suggest that  <br/>
any disappointment meant someone should stop letterboxing, but that  <br/>
if the disappointment was coloring their experience so much that it  <br/>
was an issue *for them*, it might be time to reconsider. I think I  <br/>
even implied that yes, not finding a box is disappointing. Like you,  <br/>
all I said was that how you handle that disappointment will decide  <br/>
how it affects your experience.<br/>

For example today, we took the kids out for boxes, and went 3 out of 4, missing only 1...but we had fun, got away from TV, and explored a park that I had no idea had trails.<br/>
<br/>
  I am more of a hiker, than a letterboxer, and prefer long tough hikes..so finding a box while I do such is a good bonus...If its missing, carry on, and enjoy the day.<br/>
<br/>
  If you dont set you goals high, you'll never be dissapointed...thus finding art in the woods, is just an added bonus to me...<br/>
<br/>
  For boxes that I want to last, I keep clues WOM, or make hard clues.<br/>

&gt; Thing is, when you make the experience about the box to the point <br/>
&gt; where you're more than a little disappointed if one is missing or un-<br/>
&gt; findable for whatever reason, you're setting yourself up.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, I think a large part of this game is the fact that it's <br/>
a challenge.  A while back someone described their feeling when <br/>
finding their first box was amazement that it actually worked.  If <br/>
you easily found every box, it would lose much of its appeal, just <br/>
like playing any game loses its appeal if you always win.  Sometimes <br/>
it's good to play a game where you win handily, but sometimes you <br/>
need to be challenged and sometimes you need to lose.  Otherwise you <br/>
start feeling like you're just going through the motions.<br/>
<br/>
You should be disappointed when you don't find a box; if you weren't, <br/>
that means you don't care.  But being disappointed when you don't <br/>
find a box goes hand in hand with being elated when you do find a <br/>
box.<br/>

 deciding to be disappointed, then complaining that you're  <br/>

 because we can't figure out the clue or because an animal has dragged  <br/>
 the box off. That's part of the deal. Yes, letterboxing is different  <br/>
 from hiking, but it's not at all likely that any LBer will go for too  <br/>
 long without coming off a trail with an Attempted instead of a  <br/>
 Find..... It's our choice how to handle that and allowing it to  <br/>
 frustrate you too much instead of making it a fleeting twinge may be  <br/>
 a sign that you'd prefer a more certain hobby. No biggie.<br/>

&gt; Without finding letterboxes we are all "just" hikers.  SO... even if the<br/>
&gt; hike, the cool location etc, is part of the fun, we are boxers!  We want to<br/>
&gt; find letterboxes.   We do!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I feel bad that every time someone expresses disappointment at not finding a<br/>
&gt; box they are told to just be happy with the journey.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, interesting point.  People are drawn to letterboxing for many different reasons -- art, spending time outside, solving puzzling clues, the scenery, hiking, etc.  For me it is all of these things.<br/>
<br/>
Like several others, I was a hiker long before I ever heard of letterboxing.  Perhaps that is why even though I am disappointed in not finding a box (aren't we all?), it really is not a big deal when I come away empty-handed on a letterbox hunt -- because I enjoyed being "just" a hiker before there ever was a letterbox at the end of the trail.  Having a letterbox along my trail is a nice reason to go, but by no means my sole reason to go.  Were there to be no more letterboxes, I would still hike and find it enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Ultimately, we are letterboxers.  At least I am.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately I am out to enjoy what comes my way, be that a wonderful hike, a breathtaking view, a challenging hunt or a letterbox.  I've found that life is much more enjoyable when you try to find enjoyment in whatever comes along, even if it is not what you were hoping to find.  At least for me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I realize that perspective is not shared by everyone, but may help to explain the difference in attitude about not finding boxes.  When you are in it for only one thing -- the stamp/art -or- the challenging clues -or- the hike -or- the scenery -- you set out with a very specific expectation tied to this area of interest.  If then the box you go after is missing or does not offer much in your area of interest, it is likely you will be more disappointed than if you participate for a variety of reasons or the overall experience as in most cases, a letterbox hunt will provide a worthwhile experience in at least one of these areas.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
It does depend on what draws a person to boxing.  None of the reasons are<br/>
wrong, they just may not be your reasons.<br/>
<br/>
SpringChick said that she was a hiker before a boxer... so that may be the<br/>
reason for her particular point of view... she's hiking anyway, the box is<br/>
the bonus.  Quite different than what Gail said!<br/>
<br/>
The people who are "stamp snobs" (said lovingly!)... the ones who really are<br/>
in it because they love to see beautiful handcarved unique stamps... they<br/>
are disappointed when they find a store bought stamp.  For them the hunt,<br/>
the hike and the interesting locations are the bonus, the beautiful stamps<br/>
are the goal.<br/>
<br/>
We all have different goals and what we consider to be the "Bonus" of<br/>

Sometimes, even if something *is* "an issue", that still doesn't mean it's a<br/>

I can go from "some" disappointment to serious disappointment in<br/>

The way I perceive what you're saying, you're deciding for another person<br/>
just how emotional they should possibly be about an interest of theirs, and<br/>
that they should consider getting out of the hobby if it doesn't match what<br/>
you consider an acceptable level of emotion.<br/>

I suspect that the poster you're referring to is me. I actually think<br/>
you and I are on similar wavelengths on this. I did not suggest that<br/>
any disappointment meant someone should stop letterboxing, but that<br/>
if the disappointment was coloring their experience so much that it<br/>
was an issue *for them*, it might be time to reconsider. I think I<br/>
even implied that yes, not finding a box is disappointing. Like you,<br/>
all I said was that how you handle that disappointment will decide<br/>
how it affects your experience.<br/>
