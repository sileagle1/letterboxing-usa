<br/>
First, the location of the wedding and/or the reception must be a <br/>
mystery.  Your invitation will have the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Second, colors have to be the LbNA colors or your regional colors if <br/>
they are different.<br/>
<br/>
Third, instead of a guest book, everybody gets to stamp in to the <br/>
event logbook.  And they need to use their trail name, of course.<br/>
<br/>
What else?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Fourth, you obviously need a commemorative box that you plant.  If<br/>
you <br/>
use a stamp at the guest book for your guests to put in their<br/>
logbook, <br/>
you could hide that one after the ceremony. <br/>
<br/>
Fifth, you write your vows in cryptoquip and your future spouse has<br/>
to <br/>
decode them at the ceremony.  (Just kidding)<br/>
<br/>
Sixth, the gifts for the bridesmaids and groomsmen are hidden in the <br/>
pockets of people at the reception that they haven't met before. <br/>
Give <br/>
each member of the bridal party a set of sequential clues (hopefully <br/>
embarrasing) that leads them to their present. <br/>
<br/>
Seventh . . . that's all I have for now.  We'll leave the rest of the <br/>
wedding to the next person.<br/>
