Texas History Letterbox Series<br/>
<br/>
The "Tejas" letterbox is located in Mission Tejas State Historical <br/>
Park.  This marks the location of the first Spanish mission in East <br/>
Texas, Mission San Francisco de los Tejas.  Tejas was the name given <br/>
to the local Indians, which means friends, and eventually the area <br/>
was called "Land of the Tejas".  This was eventually shortened <br/>
to "Tejas", which was changed by the Anglos to Texas.  The 118 acre <br/>
park is set in the East Texas Pineywoods.  It has two historic <br/>
structures to tour, camping, and hiking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
Located 12 miles southwest of Alto, on highway 21, near Weches, Texas<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Enter the park and obtain a map at the entry station, then drive to <br/>
the "Commemorative Mission".  Get out and take a look (and also find <br/>
Silver Eagle's box).  From here, drive to the pond, which is at the <br/>
end of the road past the playground.  Park at the picnic area near <br/>
the pond's spillway.  Find the #34 post near the pond.  From here, go <br/>
left (North) over the spillway on the nature trail.  Eventually you <br/>
will turn East, following the pond bank.  At this turn is a bench.  <br/>
