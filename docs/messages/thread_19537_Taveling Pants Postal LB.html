Anywho....It put me in the frame of mind to launch the "Traveling Pants Postal LB". I will be accepting the first 20 people only. The PLB will be sent in order of requests received. <br/>
<br/>
You need to send it along straight away. Delivery confirmation would be nice. And I do ask that if you sign up you plan on emailing me when you receive it. Other than that....knock yourself out! <br/>
<br/>
Just send me your snail mail address. And please keep the subject line the same as this email! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks much!<br/>

This particular one is based on the books by Ann Brashares. Other people send out some based on other subjects. <br/>

This is a good group to check out if you have questions about postal letterboxes:<br/>

This PLB is full now so I can't accept any more people. Sorry!<br/>
