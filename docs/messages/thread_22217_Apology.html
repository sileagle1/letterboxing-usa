<br/>
I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
If I'd stopped to think before posting, I might have realized that my<br/>
post about hand-carved stamps might have been a can of worms.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry.  I'm an artist and I put a lot of time into my hand-carved<br/>
stamps.  Sometimes, if a letterbox disappears quickly (and<br/>
repeatedly), I'm tempted to replace it with a store-bought stamp so<br/>
that I have less of a personal investment in the stamp.  If the box<br/>
continues to disappear, I'm a lot better at shrugging it off when it<br/>
wasn't my personal art.<br/>
<br/>
But, I wasn't sure if the quality of the stamp was a big issue for<br/>
people.  It isn't for me, although I will work a little harder to find<br/>
a hand-carved stamp that I really, really want to see.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I'll also work a little harder if the clues are clever, the<br/>
location is simply gorgeous, or I'm determined to be victorious in the<br/>
hunt.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly, for me anyway, letterboxing is about fun and the hike.  I love<br/>
how many parks I've explored that I didn't even know existed until I<br/>
began letterboxing.  The experiences on the trail have been fabulous. <br/>
I take photos, I make sketches, I have a nature journal... all of this<br/>
has been enhanced by letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I've met tremendous people on the trail and at letterboxing<br/>
events, as well as on this list.<br/>
<br/>
I am very sad and sorry that I didn't realize how snotty my question<br/>
might sound. And,  I apologize for asking it at a time when nerves<br/>
seem a bit frayed, and sensitivities are heightened.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I value every stamp in my letterboxing log books.  The<br/>
vast majority of stamps in my own book are store-bought and often<br/>
reflect the wit and whimsy of the stamp's owner or planter.  I'm<br/>
delighted by these symbols of friendship and shared interests.<br/>
<br/>
But, I am sorry that I was so thoughtless on the list.  It was unintentional.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Aisling<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Beautifully said, but in my opinion there is no apology needed.<br/>
<br/>
A group this large is going to have some wonderful differences of <br/>
opinion, on letterboxing and the world at large.  It is entertaining <br/>
and amusing to me to hear them (as long as people remain civil, or <br/>
at least witty).  This, of all weekends, we should be thrilled that <br/>
so many who are so different can come together on this forum.<br/>
<br/>
That said, as I am also in Houston, I was preparing to duck.  When <br/>
not "indisposed," I am quite sure that Lady P. could hurl a Sevres <br/>
tea cup with deadly aim all the way down here.  <br/>

<br/>
ps--feel free to hide some of that gorgeous hand-carved art down <br/>
here.  I for one, will greatly appreciate it!<br/>

<br/>
     To explain myself, you left me no choice but to<br/>
contact you via a public forum. I apologize for any<br/>
embarrassment this may have caused you. <br/>
<br/>
     On the other hand, if you would kindly answer<br/>
your phone, then perhaps these awkward questions of<br/>
payment would not be broached in such a manner.  <br/>
<br/>
Truly,<br/>
