Tinkerville Brook is located in the Westford section of Ashford. It is said<br/>
that it was named Tinkerville because of a small group of gypsies or tinkers<br/>
that resided along the brook. It is owned by Joshuas Trust and hikers are<br/>
welcome.<br/>

And my son said he had been there before for a nature walk with his <br/>
school but they had come in from the other end of the road. We didn't <br/>
know that it came out on Armitage Road. It is a great spot for a <br/>
picnic the roar of the brook was so nice.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the hike,<br/>

&gt; Tinkerville Brook is located in the Westford section of Ashford. It <br/>
is said<br/>
&gt; that it was named Tinkerville because of a small group of gypsies or <br/>
tinkers<br/>
&gt; that resided along the brook. It is owned by Joshua's Trust and <br/>
hikers are<br/>
&gt; welcome.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the intersection of routes 44 and 89 in Ashford, go North on <br/>
route 89.<br/>
&gt; You come to a T with a church in front of you. Route 89 turns left <br/>
here and<br/>
&gt; so do you. Further up the road Route 89 makes a 90 degree right <br/>
turn. At<br/>
&gt; this point go straight onto Turnpike Road. Go 6/10 of a mile down <br/>
Turnpike<br/>
&gt; Road and turn right onto Armitage Rd. Follow Armitage Road 7/10 of a <br/>
mile<br/>
&gt; and the entrance to the property is on your left. It is a small <br/>
entrance.<br/>
&gt; You can only park a couple cars here. Ahead of you is a metal gate <br/>
to stop<br/>
&gt; vehicles and a small yellow, wooden sign stating hikers welcome and <br/>
a sign<br/>
&gt; stating that it is Joshua's Trust property.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Walk past the metal gate and follow the curved dirt road down hill <br/>
towards a<br/>
&gt; pond and old gravel pit. Walk along the left side of the pond. You <br/>
will have<br/>
&gt; to cross a very small intermittent brook and go up and down a steep <br/>
mound.<br/>
&gt; From this point the trail is well marked with yellow blazed trees. <br/>
The trail<br/>
&gt; goes up and down on a winding trail. You go through an area that may <br/>
be a<br/>
&gt; bit wet depending on the season. The trail starts to go along a <br/>
stream.<br/>
&gt; Follow the yellow blazes. You will pass a large, old, stone bridge <br/>
abutment<br/>
&gt; . From here to your goal the stream has several small waterfalls and <br/>
rapids.<br/>
&gt; Nice place for a picnic but no tables are available. Nice views in <br/>
this<br/>
&gt; area. You quickly come to a Y in the path. Bear right following the <br/>
stream.<br/>
&gt; You will quickly come to a very large boulder overlooking the stream <br/>
and the<br/>
&gt; end of it touching the trail. This boulder is just past the 4th <br/>
yellow<br/>
&gt; blazed tree after the Y in the trail. While standing on the trail <br/>
next to<br/>
&gt; this huge rock, take a reading of 200 degrees and take 26 steps in <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; direction. A few steps to your left, behind a large rock, down low, <br/>
is the<br/>
&gt; goal you seek.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Follow the trail the way you came to go back to your car. A one way <br/>
walk<br/>
&gt; from your car to your goal takes about 20 to 25 minutes one way.<br/>
