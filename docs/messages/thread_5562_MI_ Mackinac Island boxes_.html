                    <html><body>Has anyone found all of the Mackinac Island letterboxes?  The link on the website for Michigan UP boxes (if I'm reading it correctly) shows that there are 17 in all.  I followed the link to the clues.  I only see clues for perhaps 3 boxes (and one of those seems to be located on the mainland)?  There is also a photo trail; perhaps that is for another box?  Or, is this like multi-cache geocaching, where one box has the coordinates to point you to the next box?<br/>
<br/>
I'm curious as to the total number of boxes available on the island.  I'm trying to justify making a long weekend stay on the island, so I'm hoping someone can clue me in as to the actual number of boxes.  Since you need to take the ferry across to the island, and automobile transit on the island is nonexistent, I need to plan carefully.  Guess I better take my bike with me!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

day. It was the wierdest thing. But don't worry about needing <br/>
an "excuse" to weekend Mackinac: that's a jewel you can go to without <br/>
any logical reason at all!<br/>
