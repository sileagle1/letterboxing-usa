it's the first video.<br/>

WOW!  That was horrible.  It was like Blair Witch meets <br/>
letterboxing.  The only thing I got out of that 10 minutes was motion <br/>
sick.  Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure I'd be happy about this being posted if I were the <br/>
placer of the first box being that the location was given away.  But, <br/>
I suppose you'd have to have the clues to know where it was <br/>
exactly.  Either way, I definitely do not want footage of my boxes <br/>
being posted online in that manner.<br/>

I'd be much more satisfied if someone HAD rolled down the <br/>
hill.  LOL.  But, maybe I just want company in my <br/>

Saturday.  Misery loves company, right?<br/>

I can't believe they couldn't find a better 10 minutes to film!  And <br/>
ditch the songs! I'd rather hear them chattering about where they're <br/>
going and working through the clues than some schmaltzy song.<br/>

My letterboxing sister put a series of videos together for me as a hunt for<br/>
my Easter basket one year.  She handed me a videotape.  When I played it, it<br/>
was a clue to a hiding spot.  When I found the spot, another tape was<br/>
waiting.  That clue held the clue to the next hiding spot.  At the end of<br/>
the sixth clue was my Easter basket.  I told her that after all that work,<br/>
there had better be nothing but chocolate in that basket.  Chocolate and<br/>
peeps.  And that the ears were going first.  (She always hates it when I do<br/>
the ears first -- she's a feet first bunnyeater.)<br/>
