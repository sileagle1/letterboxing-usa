I have a letterbox inside a library. I first tried to put it in the big<br/>
'main' library downtown, but after a staff meeting about it, they decided<br/>
they didn't want to be responsible for it (either having it in the general<br/>
area or having to pull it out from a protected place for people that ask).<br/>
So I went to the small branch library near my house (still part of the mail<br/>
library system though, so I expected the same answer) and got a totally<br/>
different attitude. I happened to be there when the director was there and<br/>
she was very excited about having it there (even took her family on a<br/>
letterbox hunt later!).<br/>
Morel: If you want to put one inside somewhere, ask, and if told no, ask<br/>
elsewhere!<br/>

Look around at the people you know, Your friends, your brother-in-<br/>

Then you have someone that you can ask to "host" a letterbox for you.<br/>
