Well, I learned about Lbing from an article in Yankee Magazine.Needless to say I was intrigued. Got some supplies together and went in search of my first letterbox in Brunswick/Topsham, ME....Rings in Heaven (directions in  LBNA site). First try was a complete dud, 2nd try was successful and to my great surprise I discovered the FFA Hitchiker that was originally placed in KY, travelled to VT then to ME. I'm "hooked" and am planning to place a few in southwestern Maine from Brunswick  south, so keep your eyes peeled.<br/>

of Heaven box.  I didn't plant it - but I did stop in<br/>
to find it on a trip up this winter.  It really is a<br/>
wonderful location and neat hike!<br/>
<br/>
Another great and fun place to check out is the one in<br/>
the Kittery area.  Last I heard some or all of the<br/>
ones in Freeport (Wolf Neck State Park) had gone<br/>
missing.  Maybe someone here can give you a update -<br/>
or do a quick search of the archives.  I seem to<br/>
remember it being posted in very early spring.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, welcome, and happy boxing!!<br/>
