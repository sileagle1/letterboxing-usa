was to look up someone (start with friends and family)<br/>
who sews and has one of those obscenely expensive<br/>
sewing machine systems. My mom has one that you can<br/>
plug into the computer to draw or scan a design, and<br/>
then have the machine embroider it. The right person<br/>
might do it for a couple of bucks over materials, but<br/>
I know the reccommended thread isnt real cheap. Sorry,<br/>
but my mom is WAY- busy right now. Good luck!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I won't pretend to know definitively where the<br/>
cheapest place is.  You may well have somewhere local<br/>
that can do them, or you may be able to find someone<br/>
willing, as Spike suggested.<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER, I can give you something to compare against<br/>
because I've recently been shopping out patches for<br/>
our state group.  <br/>
<br/>
About the fewest you can order commercially is 50, but<br/>
50 is twice as much $$$ per patch as 100 is, so if you<br/>
are going to order, you may as well get 100.  <br/>
<br/>
You shouldn't have to pay for artwork, shouldn't have<br/>
to pay per thread color (most companies offer 7 colors<br/>
for the same price as one), and you shouldn't have to<br/>
pay set ups.  Average lead time is 14 days.  Probably<br/>
won't have to pay shipping either.<br/>
<br/>
50 3" patches with 4 colors and 100% embroidery was<br/>
$3.85 each delivered.  100 3" patches with 4 colors<br/>
and 100% embroidery is $1.86 each delivered.  If you<br/>
find them cheaper, ask if you have to pay for any of<br/>
the items above.  Just because you do have to pay<br/>
shipping for example, doesn't mean you haven't found a<br/>
better deal.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a couple of sites I checked out: <br/>
www.patches4less.com and www.wholesale-patches.com.  I<br/>
have some other ones at my office, but frankly, they<br/>
were all within spitting range of each other in terms<br/>
of price and what the price covers.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
