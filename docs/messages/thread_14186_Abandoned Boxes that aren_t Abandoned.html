several boxes that are definately *not* abadoned.  Also they do link <br/>
to websites with emails attached.  A friend of mine who doesnt check <br/>
this list as often also had boxes listed.  <br/>
<br/>
The following VA boxes belong to Witchiepoo:<br/>
<br/>
The Acorn Doesn't fall far from the tree<br/>
Remembering MK<br/>
Witch Way<br/>
<br/>
This box belongs to Knights of Columbo:<br/>
<br/>
Top Secret<br/>
<br/>
Alot of people may not check this list too often or verify their <br/>
clues online and I for one wouldnt have been too thrilled to find out <br/>
someone had 'adopted' a box that I check on every few months.    <br/>

In both of these cases, the box was probably transferred by the webmasters.<br/>
