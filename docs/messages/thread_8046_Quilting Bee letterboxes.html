                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is a pair of microboxes located on the Chillicothe campus of <br/>
Ohio University, in Ross County, Ohio.Placed by Salamander on 9-28-<br/>
02. Difficulty:Easy.   CLUES: Begin at the campus library.At the rear <br/>
of the building, find a set of steps. Go down the steps and proceed <br/>
down the sidewalk in an easterly direction. Go all the way to the end <br/>
of the sidewalk to the point where it makes an abrupt right turn.At <br/>
this point, take a reading of 350 degrees and go 11 paces to the edge <br/>
of the woods (1 pace=2 steps). Going in the same direction, take 16 <br/>
paces into the woods. You should see a Y-shaped fallen tree trunk <br/>
spanning a small gulley.The southernmost fork of this tree splits <br/>
into another "Y". This is the place you are interested in.  To find <br/>
the second box,walk or drive to the upper parking area near the <br/>
gymnasium.From some parts of this parking lot, you will be able to <br/>
see a bright yellow tornado warning siren atop a utility pole. Go to <br/>
this pole. From here take a bearing of 315 degrees and walk 75 <br/>
paces.Check out the base of the cottonwood tree, here you might find <br/>
a quilting bee!!<br/>
