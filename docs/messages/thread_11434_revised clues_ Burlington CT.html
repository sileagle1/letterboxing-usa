                    <html><body>Jay, please revise the clues for the Trees of the Forest box in Burlington, Ct.<br/>
To all who looked and didn't find, I apologize.  Things sure changed in the forest since I planted the box!<br/>
Here is how it SHOULD read:<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
Fron the junctin of Rt 179  and Rt 4, go west on Rt 4 to the first left (Punchbrook Rd).  There is a blinking light there.  Go 1.5 miles to a 3 way stop (if you go left here you can get to the DEP box in this forest) and continue straight till you reach 2 miles.  There are soccer fields on the left and a State Forest sign on the right.  Pull in to the right (there's not much room, but if the fields are in use you could probably park across the street there).<br/>
<br/>
Head down the logging road until you see a smaller trail off to the left.  Today (3/24/03) there was a big pile of cut logs in front of the trail.  There is a bit of a grassy spot to your left as you get to where the trail begins. From the double trunked tree at the beginning of the trail you want to walk about 60 paces through the white pines.  After the 60 paces (and climbing over or around some windfall about 50 paces in) you will see a bunch of standing white birch which point south.  From the first of these white birch there is a mulit-trunked tree at 340 degrees.  Beyond this at 335 degrees is an old stump in which your treasure rests.<br/>
<br/>
There are no forest thinning signs visible before the trail to the left, at least not now.<br/>
Sorry for any confusion<br/>
