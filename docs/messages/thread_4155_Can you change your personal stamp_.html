I have.  I started with a stamp of Mount Hood, but it was a rather <br/>
large stamp, so I carved a replacement that was a bit smaller.  The <br/>
replacement was a little spider hanging from a web.  Absolutely <br/>
nothing like my first one, but I'm glad I did it since I've since <br/>
found boxes my larger signature stamp would never have fit in.  Still <br/>
keep them both, but I don't use the larger one anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I've also been playing with ideas to replace my replacement.  It gets <br/>
boring seeing the same old stamp everywhere, don't you think?  In <br/>
fact, I think that's a great idea.  After every 100 finds that I <br/>
stamp into, I'm going to create a new signature stamp and retire the <br/>
previous one.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Up to 94.  Looks like I'll have to make a new one soon!<br/>

I started out with a store-bought stamp as my signature stamp and <br/>
changed when I could carve one that I liked enough to use as a <br/>
signature.  Then my first attempts at my signature stamp did not last <br/>
very long.  The carving medium fell apart after so many stampings and <br/>
I upgraded my image using better materials.<br/>

My first letterboxing experience was a rather rushed affair and I <br/>
needed to procure five different signature stamps at once, so I <br/>
bought a child's stamp kit at a department store.<br/>
<br/>
Once our family's letterboxing hobby was more established, we sought <br/>
out more distinct stamps.<br/>
<br/>
When we have the opportunity, we re-visit letterboxes that we had <br/>
previously stamped with the old stamps and update them with our new <br/>
stamps.<br/>
