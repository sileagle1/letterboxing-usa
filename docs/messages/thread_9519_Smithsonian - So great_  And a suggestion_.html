letterbox!  Well my opinion wasn't going to stop me from visiting!<br/>
<br/>
Perfectly hidden, inspired tie in location, well made and clever <br/>
stamp, and plenty of comfortable seating.  What a wonderful <br/>
letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
Well but I do have a suggestion to make it even better.  There is <br/>
plenty of room for a double film cannister.  You take two film <br/>
cannisters and tape them together bottom to bottom.  That gives you <br/>
more room for a bigger rolled up log and a bigger stamp.  (Though <br/>
that stamp was so good and cleverly hinged it doesn't need to be <br/>
bigger.)<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>
