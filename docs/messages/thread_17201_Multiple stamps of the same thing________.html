Im sure there are several types of stamps that are similiar given the number of boxes there are across the country.  Ill bet that any series you want to do there is something similiar...and whos to know if there isnt another Pirates stamp in another state...how would you possibly know unless you looked at all clues in all states.<br/>
<br/>
Id say go for it...your state bird carving will be unique as will the others that are already placed.<br/>

I might be of a very different opinion than the rest of the group but my<br/>
personal thought on it is that there can be more than one of anything so<br/>
long as they are in distinctly different locations.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I would like to do a Lord of The Rings Series however I did<br/>
not do it while living in California because of the Middle Earth Series that<br/>
is planted there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have done the Monsters Inc. Series and the Fate of the Childhood Series<br/>
here so far in Oregon, with some things in the works for Peanuts and<br/>
Vampires.  Now personally several other people have carved Peanut stamps<br/>
recently, I have no problem with that.  Now if someone else carved them and<br/>
planted them in the same area I did I might be a bit offended.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think there is also the point of redundancy. Personally if I had one<br/>
series of stamps that was designed after Peanuts for example, and someone<br/>
else planted another one near by, it would not move to the top of my to<br/>
find list as a matter of fact it would be on the bottom, just because I<br/>
already have stamps like that.<br/>

<br/>
I think Pandora has a good point.  There are no unwritten rules about <br/>
planting similar boxes, but there are good reasons to try to make <br/>
your stamps a little bit different from everyone else--including the <br/>
one Pandora mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to hide a stamp of a snake in my early letterboxing <br/>
career--until I realized that I already had three of them in my <br/>
logbook!  So I carved a worm instead (I had a long, narrow piece of <br/>
carving material left and my subjects were limited to long, narrow <br/>
animals)--still the only letterbox with a worm stamp that I know of <br/>
which makes it extra cute and special.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Geographical location would make a difference too.  Hiding identical <br/>
stamps on both coasts probably isn't a big deal for most people since <br/>
very few letterboxers would have a chance to get both sets.  But in <br/>
the same city, such a plan would be disastrous.  Who wants a bunch of <br/>
identical images?  And when they're that close together, you can be <br/>
sure some people (not all, but some) would skip one of the series <br/>
completely.  (Which is okay, if you don't mind people not looking for <br/>
your series.)<br/>
<br/>
As for the state bird in all 50 states--you're on safe ground there.  <br/>
You surely won't be carving identical stamps of already hidden <br/>
birds.  And even then, your series would distinguish itself by being <br/>
a nationwide series--not quite the same as the lone bird stamp hiding <br/>
out in the woods.<br/>

worth about half a cent now on this board). <br/>
<br/>
I say go for it! IMO, every stamp is different, even if they're <br/>
exactly the same image. Everyone carves differently, and I think <br/>
that's what makes letterboxing such a personal hobby. In one day, we <br/>
found two boxes with almost identical stamps. The slight differences <br/>
were probably because they were carved by different people. Was one <br/>
stamp better than the other? Nope, just different. <br/>
And if you've ever eaten at Arby's, you know that "Different is <br/>
good!"  :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I've got a question and I'm asking this in the sincerest means possible, <br/>
&gt;I have not hidden agenda, no ulterior motives, nothing other than <br/>
&gt;curiosity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Is there an unspoken rule that only one carving of something can 'exist' <br/>
&gt;at once?  In other words, my grandiose plans of planting a stamp in each of <br/>
&gt;the 50 states of the Union, and choosing to depict the State Bird of the <br/>
&gt;state each box is placed in.....  Does this constitute a transgression?  <br/>
&gt;Can only one stamp of something exist at one time?  Should one carving of <br/>
&gt;something exist at one time? Does the fact that someone else carves it, <br/>
&gt;make it 'different'?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   In example, can no one ever carve anything related to the 'Pirates of <br/>
&gt;the Caribbean' because Team Rayvenhaus already has?  If someone else has <br/>
&gt;carved Pirates Flags before, can no one else ever do it again?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Please share you thoughts with me on this, I am interested on knowing.<br/>

Have the bird hold something unique from the state (like a Rhode Island Red maintaining a quahog in one wing or in his beak).  Put the bird next to a representation of something from the state, like the Gateway Arch or the Washington Monument.  Does D.C. get a bird?  We always seem to be giving it to them...<br/>

D.C.'s bird is the Wood Thrush.  Their flower is the American Beauty<br/>
Rose.  Their motto is "Justitia Omnibus" (Justice to all)  Additional<br/>

the states to the the Commonwealths and Territories section).<br/>
