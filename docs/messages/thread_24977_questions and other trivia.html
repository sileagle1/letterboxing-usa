Over the years I've thrown out various yes/no and other<br/>
question tokens -- either about specific boxes or generic<br/>
tokens -- either on this list or in boxes.  Some of these<br/>
have been used, but most are just taking up space.<br/>
<br/>
To facilitate new games, any such tokens out there with<br/>
no expiry date expire 12/31/08.  Any such tokens related<br/>
to the CCC expire 12/31/09.  The forgoing only applies<br/>
to tokens created with no expiry date.  Now all game<br/>
tokens have an expiry date.<br/>
<br/>
As for the other trivia, anyone who is interested in my<br/>
boxes and wants a BIG hint should be first finder of<br/>
Sheba'a latest wonderful carving.<br/>

Wow, Randy, I have no CLUE of what you're talking about -- maybe that <br/>
means you aren't talking to ME, eh?  It just seemed that you were the <br/>
instituter (?) of this topic and so not just answering someone else's <br/>
question... so it seems to come out of left field.  Okay, so I'm <br/>
rambling... you may ignore this if you like, or if you care to <br/>
elucidate (enlighten) me, that would be very nice of you.  <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>

<br/>
If you don't have a token that allows you to ask questions about<br/>
my boxes, it does not apply to to you.  If you do, then that token<br/>
now has a date by which those questions need to be asked, if you<br/>
want to ever use it.<br/>
<br/>
If this still doesn't make sense, it is very likely that it does not<br/>
apply to you.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Randy, I'm asuming these tokens can be found in one of your hidden letterboxes with instructions?  I was a little confused too only because I am extremely new.  <br/>
<br/>
I am on other lists and have to stop myself before answering someone's question thinking that they should already know something.  It happens all of the time. I try to remember that people join these list's, groups, etc. everyday. That there will always be a question that sometimes people don't understand and would like too.  So sometimes a lengthy answer is sometimes curtious or we newbies wont be able to enjoy the full effects of Letterboxing or the group list that we have joined.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I understood what you were trying to tell if not I would like a better explanation also.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time and patience<br/>

Thanks, Randy.  I'll bow out gracefully now, if it isn't too late.  No <br/>
tokens yet, in my letterboxing experience.  Thanks for the reply!<br/>
