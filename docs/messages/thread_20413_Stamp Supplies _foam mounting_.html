I don't know what material was used on the stamps you found but what I<br/>
use is PZ Kut from http://www.stampeaz.com/ <br/>
It's so easy to carve and mount on 1/4" or 5mm fun foam available in<br/>
crafts stores like JoAnn's. The foam will give a firm back for<br/>
printing but won't warp...provided "Goop" is NOT used for glue. I use<br/>
"Elmer's Craft Bond Ultra Sticks All", other boxers use 5 minute<br/>
epoxy. The foam can also be cut with scissors.<br/>

&gt; They dont happen to have that rubber I've seen a few (of the 12 <br/>

  I too just used that tutorial and loved it!  I am now only using that technique. It is easy, fun and not expensive.  <br/>
