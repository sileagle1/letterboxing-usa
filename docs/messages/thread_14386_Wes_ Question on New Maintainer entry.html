Hi,<br/>
  I went to the website to look at the new feature.<br/>
I looked at the form for entering new boxes, but it does not have a <br/>
place for entering who will maintain the box. Should it?<br/>
<br/>
[WG] No.  Right now, you put in a box, and if you want to <br/>
<br/>
Then I clicked on "edit" to look at my own boxes.<br/>
My boxes said the Maintainer was "Abandoned Box"!<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean that all registered box owners now have to go back and <br/>
revise their box entries to keep them from being deleted? Yikes! [I <br/>
have changed mine, but I hope this is not necessary for those with <br/>
lots of boxes]<br/>
<br/>
[WG]  Good point.  I changed all boxes to use the owner ID, unless<br/>
[WG]  we've already changed it.  So, now you automatically maintain<br/>
[WG]  your boxes, unless you don't.<br/>
<br/>
Then, when I viewed my clues normally, not as owner, I saw that it <br/>
has, as before, a link to contact the placer, but not the maintainer.<br/>
If the maintainance person cannot be viewed, how will this new <br/>
function help?<br/>
<br/>
[WG]  I think the email should always go to the maintainer, so <br/>
[WG]  that's what's I'll probably make it do.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if one wants to adopt a box, how would one sign on and do this -<br/>
at present, it looks like only the owner can do that?<br/>
<br/>
[WG]  Email the webmasters or Judi.<br/>
