<br/>
I decided to make a database for the NJ gathering so that we know who <br/>
all is coming and what they're bringing. I believe the original <br/>
intent was for it to be a potluck. I think there may have been some <br/>
mix up with that (not sure though) so I decided to bring burgers and <br/>
rolls for everyone so that no one is without lunch. We'll also be <br/>
bringing rice krispy treats. We'll be bringing our own beverage and I <br/>
suggest that everyone do the same. It makes it easier that way since <br/>
alot of people only drink diet drinks or don't drink soda or what <br/>
have you. I've been to other potlucks where everyone brought their <br/>
own drinks, and it's worked out beautifully. :)<br/>
If you plan on attending the gathering, please add your info to the <br/>
database. I hope letterboxingbee doesn't take any objection to me <br/>
creating the database. I just thought it would come in handy when <br/>
trying to plan on what to bring. <br/>
<br/>
Hope to see alot of you there!  <br/>
