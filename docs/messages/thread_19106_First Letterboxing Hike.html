                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone,<br/>
I am new to this group and new to letterboxing! After deciding<br/>
a few weeks ago that my kids and I would do lots of hiking this summer,<br/>
a friend of mine posted about letterboxing on a different site. Alas,<br/>
hiking with a purpose! How great is that? Today, we went on our first <br/>
hike<br/>
at Peace Valley Park in Bucks County, PA and found Henson's Friends<br/>
alive and well. Twas a long hike considering I had my 2, 5 and 7 yo's <br/>
with me...<br/>
but, what fun and the 2 yo walked most of the way! Note to self, though,<br/>
bring kiddy backpack, just in case.<br/>
<br/>
I love to get away from the business and noise of life and<br/>
just exist in nature. I think our next hike will be the "Whose the <br/>
author?"<br/>
series recently planted in Doylestown. And, I am saving the Zwxtr <br/>
Trilogy<br/>
for when my trekkies can accompany me.<br/>
<br/>
Lessons learned today:<br/>
1- Bring kiddy backpack (already mentioned)<br/>
2- Wear old clothes... why didn't I think to change out of my new <br/>
capri's before<br/>
hiking?<br/>
3-  Go ahead an invest in those poison ivy postcards sold at the <br/>
website someone<br/>
posted yesterday because I am just terrible at identifying plants<br/>
4- Find out what a "pace" means in generalized terms because my size <br/>
"pace"<br/>
was definitely not the same as the box placers (still found the box, <br/>
though, due<br/>
to the good description of the log)<br/>
5- Invest in better shoes.<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to start creating stamps and planting boxes. We will, <br/>
hopefully, start<br/>
the stamp carving tomorrow. I need to come up with a good name, though.<br/>
Do we go family name or individuals? Hmmm.... For now, I'll just go by<br/>
my usual name...<br/>

As for names, we decide (I decided) we'd go with Team Duggan and <br/>
then each of us has individual names.  The kids picked their own <br/>
except our two year old.  We call him little buoy.  When he's older <br/>
he can pick one of his own.<br/>

Two lists you should join, newboxers@yahoogroups.com for all of those millions of questions we new boxers have. It's a great forum! And lbma@yahoogroups.com for letterboxers in the mid-atlantic region. Again, great resource and great folks. Also, I hiked some boxes in Doylestown last week and strongly recommend the Kids Castle box in Central Park in Doylestown. There is a HUGE play castle for your little ones there, although you may have trouble pulling them away to find the box! Great place for kids though. I am also going to be planting a series geared towards very young kids soon, an easy walk with about 5 images. I will post to the list when it's ready. Take care and welcome!<br/>

Doesn't the term 'mid-Atlantic' ever bother anyone?  Because to me, <br/>
mid-Atlantic sounds like some place about halfway between the <br/>
Americas and Europe/Africa--you know, like where the Lost City of <br/>
Atlantis might be found, perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought to ponder....<br/>
<br/>
And the 'mid-west'?  What's up with that?  It looks more like <br/>
the 'mid-east' to me on a map of the US.  Granted, there might be <br/>
some confusion with the mid-east of Africa/Asia area in news stories, <br/>
but before the Americas were discovered, they probably called that <br/>
area the mid-west.  When did it become the mid-east?<br/>
<br/>
And while I'm at it, why does Virginia reach further west than West <br/>
Virginia?  Perhaps renaming Virginia East Virginia or something would <br/>
make more sense instead.<br/>
<br/>
Inquiring minds want to know!<br/>

  I hadn't thought of that. So, the next time someone  <br/>
  really 'painful' or worrisome asks where I'm from I can tell <br/>
  them "the mid-Atlantic region", you know, somewhere between the <br/>

 You're a parent so you probably already have the tissues, wet wipes, <br/>
 sunblock, hats, small snack, etc.  Someone here mentioned water. I <br/>
 always take more than I think I'll need and still run out. Bug <br/>
 spray. I don't think that I would have gotten through the walk a <br/>
 couple of times without it - in the pack and reapplying. <br/>
<br/>
 If there's any room left in that bag or pack, take some letterbox <br/>
 first aid supplies : paper towels to dry out wet boxes and to leave <br/>
 behind as a blotter for the stamp. Zippy bags; sandwich and quart <br/>
 seem to be the two most commonly used sizes. A small notepad or <br/>
 booklet, for I've encountered a couple that were so wet that they <br/>
 could no longer be used. This concept was totally lost on me my <br/>
 first few times out when I needed the supplies the most. Good luck <br/>
 and have fun!<br/>

 like where the Lost City of <br/>
&gt; Atlantis might be found, perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
Aegean Sea-Ryan.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And the 'mid-west'?  What's up with that?  It looks more like <br/>
&gt; the 'mid-east' to me on a map of the US.  Granted, there might be <br/>
&gt; some confusion with the mid-east of Africa/Asia area in news <br/>
stories, <br/>
&gt; but before the Americas were discovered, they probably called that <br/>
&gt; area the mid-west.  When did it become the mid-east?<br/>
<br/>
Depends on your perspective.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And while I'm at it, why does Virginia reach further west than West <br/>
&gt; Virginia? <br/>
<br/>
No major city there, doesn't count; majority of the state is east of <br/>
West Virginia.<br/>

After you find a few by the same planter, you start to remember <br/>
things like that about them: who has what size pace, who counts <br/>
steps, not paces, who thinks scrabbling for half an hour up a 60 <br/>
degree slope is "one short climb", etc. It's not uncommon for my <br/>
kids to ask, mid-hike, "Whose box is this, again?", and then respond <br/>
to the answer, "OOOOOH, now I get it."<br/>

Yes, indeed, and good SOCKS to wear in them. Wayne got me hiking <br/>
socks (said so on the label) as part of a letterboxing kit last <br/>
Christmas, all in fun, but they turned out to be the best part of <br/>
the kit. If you get your shoes in an outdoor store (No, Ryan, the <br/>
store is INDOORS, selling outdoorsy STUFF, don't get going) they <br/>
should be right with the shoes.<br/>
