original K-Martha by Legerdemaine was definitely NOT a traveling event<br/>
stamp but a hitch hiker. The enigmatic creator of this opus was never<br/>
a fan of the "box on the table" phenomenon that has become common at<br/>
gatherings. In fact, he has not been known to frequent gatherings at<br/>
all, at least not in a recognizeable personna. There have, however,<br/>
been several unconfirmed sightings over the years. I don't blame<br/>
anyone for wanting to own this stamp, a venerable piece of<br/>
letterboxing legend. Funhog<br/>

&gt; Unless this is some sort of high-level letterboxing ruse, this is VERY<br/>
&gt; disturbing.  The stamp you see on eBay is in fact, a travelling event<br/>
&gt; stamp carved by Legerdemaine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How or why it got on eBay I have no idea, but it seems perhaps (from<br/>
&gt; the questions listed) that someone placed it inside a box placed on<br/>
&gt; NPS land that was confiscated.  It most certainly does not belong to<br/>
&gt; Martha Stuart -- and whoever pays for it is being duped.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Alarming.  Very alarming.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (Unless, as I said, its a well-conceived letterboxing ruse, but I<br/>
&gt; doubt it).<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I got this in one of my ebay favorites. Although, personally, I am <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not in the market for it, I found it very interesting.  Does <br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; know the history on this?  Did she use it in prison?  (Do they <br/>
&gt; &gt; have <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing in prison?)<br/>

1) first off, anyone bidding on this is not that smart an ebayer, look <br/>
at the replies to questions from the placer of the item.....proves it <br/>
is a fake..For anyone placing a bid on this item, you arent that smart.<br/>
(sorry) Maybe Ill post "wings" on ebay...Its clear there are buyers <br/>
out there, for bogus products...<br/>
<br/>
2) just for giggles....lets say It's Martha's official stamp.  Who <br/>
cares!.....She is a crook, and care less if Prsident Bush had a stamp. <br/>
Just dont understand why anyone would want this, If it were <br/>
real...Donate money to something worthy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck on all the bidders....suckers!<br/>
