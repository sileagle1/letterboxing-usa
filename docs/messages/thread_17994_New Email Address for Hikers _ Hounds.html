After joining this group my personal account was getting clogged so I created a second account, hikersandhounds@yahoo.com, just for LBNA messages. For some reason Yahoo deleted that account yesterday and numerous emails yahoo support have gone unanswered. So I just changed the spelling a little and updated it on the Letterboxing.org site. I am so pissed! Fortunately I copied of of the Truckin' PLB email responses to a word doc so I didn't lose them! I should be mailing Truckin' sometime soon. My mom passed unexpectedly and except for a few hours respite for the PA Leap Day Gethering which was AWESOME, I have been very busy with family stuff. Has anyone ever had yahoo just delete an email account on them? I am truly mistified and can't get any response from yahoo. As I said, up until now I have been very happy with them. Well, let's see how long this account lasts!<br/>
