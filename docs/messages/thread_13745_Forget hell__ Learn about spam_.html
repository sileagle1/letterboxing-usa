&gt; After seeing Sir Balthazar's post, I decided to go see what is in the files<br/>
&gt; area for this list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm aghast and I intend to immediately STOP recommending the list to<br/>
&gt; families and friends due certain files being there. Enough others are<br/>
&gt; yelling about the two JPG files but I was more offended and shocked by this<br/>
&gt; one -<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; FREE Dating Websites For Singles and Married.htm - that file's description<br/>
&gt; speaks openly about having sex pictures. If this mailing list is an<br/>
&gt; adult-only list, then it should be made clear SOMEWHERE. If it is for all<br/>
&gt; ages, why are you allowing people to post sex pictures to the file<br/>
&gt; area?????? I intend to research the matter after I finish posting this<br/>
&gt; message to determine if this is a violation of federal law. I believe it is,<br/>
&gt; but I'm going to find out whom to contact and how to report that file<br/>
&gt; remaining on an all-ages area with NO warnings posted ANYWHERE. Since my own<br/>
&gt; son is a member of this list and thereby has the ability to access that<br/>
&gt; file, that is AT LEAST ONE MINOR HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO PORNOGRAPHY AS A DIRECT<br/>
&gt; RESULT OF THE INACTIVITY OF THE MODERATOR and I'm sure he is not the only<br/>
&gt; one. Therefore, the moderator has already committed a crime against a minor<br/>
&gt; and leaving it there constitutes further crimes against children. Given that<br/>
&gt; it has been up there for 4 days, I'd think any moderator doing their job<br/>
&gt; would have had ample time to take it down. Unless the moderator wishes to<br/>
&gt; continue to distribute pornography to children? In which case, I'm sure the<br/>
&gt; FBI will be speaking to him/her very soon about their actions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; HELLO MODERATOR - there is one on this list right? Are you watching what is<br/>
&gt; going on? Do you feel that PORNOGRAPHY has something to do with letterboxing<br/>
&gt; and it is vital that those picture be distributed to MINORS? Is letterboxing<br/>
&gt; an adult-only activity and you just FORGOT to post that anywhere in any<br/>
&gt; information? Or is your goal to purposely lure in families just to<br/>
&gt; distribute porn?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I fully realize that file was posted by a member during the recent slew of<br/>
&gt; porno attacks on Yahoo! lists. Oddly enough though, of the 37 lists I'm a<br/>
&gt; member of, only this one has LEFT the porn file up for one and all to enjoy.<br/>
&gt; Every other moderator realized that DISTRIBUTING PORNOGRAPHY TO MINORS IS A<br/>
&gt; CRIME and immediately took it down. This list however, they appear to be<br/>
&gt; encouraging the crime to continue.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my mind, continuing to have that file there, where any kid can view it,<br/>
&gt; is the moderator's purposeful distribution of pornography to minors and<br/>
&gt; he/she should be taken immediately to task if that file isn't off there<br/>
&gt; within two minutes of them reading this post. As a moderator of more than a<br/>
&gt; dozen Yahoo! groups myself, I know exactly how long AND how easy it is to<br/>
&gt; remove that file so choosing not to is choosing to continue to commit a<br/>
&gt; crime, one for which I intend to hold them accountable for.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sex photos on an all ages site - how dare you leave those up there<br/>
&gt; moderator! How dare you knowingly expose children to pornography under the<br/>
&gt; guise of a "family" hobby.<br/>
