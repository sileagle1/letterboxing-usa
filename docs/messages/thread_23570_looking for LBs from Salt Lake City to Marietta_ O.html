any letterboxes that are no more than 5-10 min. from these main roads<br/>
and are easy to get to (no bushwhacking, etc.) as we have limited time<br/>
for this trip. Here are the roads we will be traveling. If you know of<br/>
any letterboxes in these areas, I appreciate your help!<br/>
I-80 East from Salt Lake to Davenport, Iowa<br/>
I-74 East from Davenport, Iowa to Indianapolis, Indiana<br/>
I-70 East from Indianapolis to I-77 South in Ohio to Marietta<br/>
Oh and I actually won't need any in Marietta, my parents live there<br/>
and we are going to have 1 whole day of letterboxing in Marietta. <br/>
Thank you all so much!<br/>
