	Welcome to letterboxing.  You are fortunate to be in Texas where the<br/>
searching weather is good all year long and there are several<br/>
high-energy ladies involved.  We are a few hardy souls here in Vermont -<br/>
no hiking right now, but I am carving a few stamps to get ready for our<br/>
own special time of the year "Mud Season".  With the mud comes sunshine,<br/>
maple syrup and the special snow that looks like huge clumps of cotton<br/>
candy and is so dense it actually clods up on the bottom of your boots.<br/>
<br/>
	So - a few commemorative mud stamps and perhaps a new series i Frog<br/>
Hollow (another story, another time).<br/>
<br/>
	You might want to try contacting Shannon Green or Julie Cunningham, I<br/>
think they both are familiar with Somerset.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
<br/>

Want to buy a book?  I'm trying to make a life-long dream come true and<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone!  I just found out about this interesting hobby a <br/>
couple of days ago and am raring to get started!  I have already <br/>
carved my personal stamp and am just itching to use it!  I am a high <br/>
school home economics and art teacher and I'm retiring at the end of <br/>
this year.  I think this would be a wonderful hobby to keep my busy <br/>
during retirement.  I have been a rubber stamper for quite a while <br/>
and think this would be a fun extension of that hobby.  I have one <br/>
tip that probably either you have tried in the field and it doesn't <br/>
work at all or someone has already mentioned it and everybody knows <br/>
it by now!  :-)  Instead of having to carry a stamp pad around, you <br/>
might try a brush tip (or other art-type) marker.  You can place the <br/>
ink directly on the stamp with the marker.  If the stamp is large and <br/>
portions dry out before it all gets inked, you can (for lack of a <br/>
better word) "huff" on the stamp, much as you do when cleaning your <br/>
glasses.  This rehydrates the stamp and the image will be clear.  I <br/>
was just putting my gear together and thought I would use a marker <br/>
instead of having to carry a stamp pad and thought I would introduce <br/>
myself and pass along this tip.  If anyone knows of any good sites in <br/>
Texas or OK to start with, I'm all ears!<br/>

   Thanks for sharing. I was out searchiing for stamps pads the other <br/>
day and could not make heads nor tails of which to choose.  I wish to <br/>
use different colors on the stamps themselves as you do!  Can you <br/>
specifically elaborate on the type of brush tip marker that might be <br/>
best, where to purchase and best colors availble.  Give us that <br/>
artistic opinion,  thanks!!<br/>

of <br/>
&gt; this year.  I think this would be a wonderful hobby to keep my busy <br/>
&gt; during retirement.  I have been a rubber stamper for quite a while <br/>
&gt; and think this would be a fun extension of that hobby.  I have one <br/>
&gt; tip that probably either you have tried in the field and it doesn't <br/>
&gt; work at all or someone has already mentioned it and everybody knows <br/>
&gt; it by now!  :-)  Instead of having to carry a stamp pad around, you <br/>
&gt; might try a brush tip (or other art-type) marker.  You can place <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; ink directly on the stamp with the marker.  If the stamp is large <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; portions dry out before it all gets inked, you can (for lack of a <br/>
&gt; better word) "huff" on the stamp, much as you do when cleaning your <br/>
&gt; glasses.  This rehydrates the stamp and the image will be clear.  I <br/>
&gt; was just putting my gear together and thought I would use a marker <br/>
&gt; instead of having to carry a stamp pad and thought I would <br/>
introduce <br/>
&gt; myself and pass along this tip.  If anyone knows of any good sites <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; Texas or OK to start with, I'm all ears!<br/>
<br/>
Great to have another Texan joining the Letterboxing ranks!  <br/>
Letterboxing in Texas has finally started to gain momentum.  Baby <br/>
Bear and I, plus a few others, have managed to increase the number of <br/>
Letterboxes in Texas from about 10 just 6 months ago to over 100 now.<br/>
No matter where in Texas you live, there should be at least one <br/>
within a few hours drive of you (except in the west).  Some clues <br/>
have not made it to the Texas clue page yet so look in Whats New <br/>
section or the Talk List for the latest.  Looking forward to your <br/>
artistic contributions!<br/>

this hobby!  I have started carving my 6 year-old granddaughter's <br/>
stamp so she can go with me to look for boxes! I live in Chillicothe <br/>
TX (Hardeman Co.) and am almost in OK, so I hope to snag a few boxes <br/>
in both states!  I am also planning to plant a box in the near future <br/>
in a park in Hardeman Co.  Can you tell I am really excited about <br/>
this?!  LOL  <br/>
As for the markers, my particular favorite in doing just regular <br/>
rubber stamping are Marvy markers made by Uchida.  You can find them <br/>
in rubber stamp/scrapbooking stores and in outlets like Michael's and <br/>
Hobby Lobby.  <br/>
Thanks again for the welcome!<br/>

Our family will be going through that area this summer on the way to <br/>
our vacation out west, so would love to have a box to hunt. <br/>
