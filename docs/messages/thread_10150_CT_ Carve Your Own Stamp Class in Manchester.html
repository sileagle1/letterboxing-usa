<br/>
<br/>Just thought I would pass a great class along to you!  The Stamp Studio in Manchester, CT will be having a Carve Your Own Rubber Stamp Class on March 5 (Wed) from 6-8 p.m.  In this class, you will learn how to create and transfer images onto rubber and how to carve those images into useable stamps.  Unlike other "carve your own" classes, we will cover techniques like shadowing, shading and texturing.  It's easy and fun for all levels.  Come give it a try!  This is a great class for those who have discovered letterboxing.  All $20.  (just a note since I asked Melinda about this today: this includes a piece of the pink rubber material, but not carving tools.  They are sold at the shop separately)  If you would like to sign up (like I did :-)  The phone number is 860-432-1087.
<br/>
<br/>Hope to meet a lot of letterboxers!!!!  I'll be sure to bring my stamp so we can exchange either before or after the class!
