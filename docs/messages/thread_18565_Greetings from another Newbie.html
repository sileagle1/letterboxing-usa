the NPR story. Thanks to all the experienced letterboxers for answering <br/>
all the questions of the newcomers! I was just wondering today about <br/>
the specifications for a logbook, and lo and behold, all my questions <br/>
were answered in today's posts to the list.<br/>
<br/>
I found my second letterbox yesterday--the Real 49er located at Cal <br/>
State Long Beach (Eureka!) But there was one challenge this city girl <br/>
was NOT prepared for--a dead squirrel was on the ground, 3-4 feet from <br/>
the hiding place. Eeeeww! The first test of my true grit as a <br/>
letterboxer! But I would not be deterred! Neither squirrel carcass nor <br/>
cobwebs would keep me from my appointed find! (Note to other newbies: <br/>
I've now learned that a coat hanger is an ESSENTIAL tool of the <br/>
letterboxing trade.)<br/>
<br/>
The Real 49er is an especially nicely carved stamp. Kudos and many <br/>
thanks to Don and Gwen! (Also--Don &amp; Gwen, I couldn't retrieve the <br/>
other two boxes at CSULB yesterday  due to the annual Kaleidescope <br/>
festival--there were WAY too many people in the areas around both boxes <br/>
to allow me to reach them undetected. I'll be on campus again next <br/>
week, so I'll check on the whether "Catching Some Sun" has stayed dry <br/>
when I go back, and stamp in at the 49er mascot box for the first <br/>
time--looking forward to it!)<br/>
