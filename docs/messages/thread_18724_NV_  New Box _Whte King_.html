                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, this post gave me the best idea...hehehehe lol.  I just finished <br/>
the best book!  It was called The Eight by Katherine Neville, and it <br/>
had to do with chess (loosely) and how the characters in the book <br/>
were chess pieces, so the "white king" was actually a character in <br/>
the book.  Makes me want to create a "black queen" box (the main <br/>
character in the book) and leave the first finder a special surprise <br/>
copy of the book.  Though its a really big book.  Now that you got me <br/>
thinking, I could do a whole set of book-themed boxes (did I mention <br/>
that I'm also a bookcrosser? lol).  <br/>
I did the silliest thing the other night.  I was so excited to get my <br/>
stamp carving kit in the mail the other night that I carved away for <br/>
hours.  Rush job, but actually looked decent considering how detailed <br/>
it was.  For some reason after playing around with it for a while i <br/>
got the bright idea to wash my stamp.  Scrubbed it real good.  So <br/>
good I scrubbed away all of the fine carvings.  Duh.  Even woke up <br/>
with a sore neck and back the next morning after being hunched over <br/>
the table all night long! :P  Thats okay, I'm never satisfied with <br/>
anything less than perfection anyhow. I'm so excited, I can't wait to <br/>
get started!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the "south pole" bear, cross the street and go "that-a-way."<br/>
&gt; 100 paces from the corner is a set of rusty stairs.<br/>
&gt; White King's box is under the bottom step, on the north side.<br/>
&gt; The stamp will look best in two colors, so bring your markers.<br/>
&gt; Please rehide well in the same location.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fitting, I guess, that it's the 11th of May and I got snowed on <br/>
while<br/>
&gt; scouting the location for this box.  I will not be able to check on<br/>
&gt; this box very often, so a status update would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The usual disclaimers: be careful when reaching into unknown spaces.<br/>
