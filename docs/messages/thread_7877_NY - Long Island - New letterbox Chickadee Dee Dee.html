No pets. Easy. Hand made Stamp.<br/>
<br/>
This is a very nice path through a sanctuary. There are birds and critters<br/>
everywhere if you stay quiet and walk slowly. Walk a ways down the main<br/>
path, hold your hand open and away from your body offering your sunflower<br/>
seeds (None of that parakeet stuff). Hold very, very still, and see what<br/>
happens. If you are with a group spread out a bit so that you aren't too<br/>
intimidating. This is truly an experience, communing with nature.<br/>
<br/>
After your experience, walk on down the main trail until you come to a bench<br/>
on the right. Turn around and walk 12 paces back. On your left is a large<br/>
tree. On the opposite side is a small multi-trunk tree. Look behind that<br/>
under bark and leaves.<br/>
<br/>
Do explore deeper into park.  Someday I will return and move the box to a<br/>
more interesting hiding place.  If someone lives near there and would like<br/>
to move it call me or post a message for the Chickadee Dee Dee on the board.<br/>
