                    <html><body><p>There was a small mistake in the directions for the final box in Day of the Dragon King that I posted a few days ago.  I changed the mistake Wed night but forgot to post that there was an error for anyone who might have copied it before then.  I am only mentioning this because it is in prime boxing territory and some may have made copies in anticipation of Saturday.</p>
<p>The third sentence in the final paragraph the directions should say, "You will cross over Buckeye Brook again and there will be another dam off in the trees to your left."  The initial directions said Buckeye Brook Road.  Hopefully anyone who might have copied it in advance will figure out the mistake anyway.</p>
<p>Hope to see many of you tomorrow!</p>
