Three's A Crowd<br/>
<br/>
This playful trio can be found huddled together near an old Jackson <br/>
county "hot spot."<br/>
<br/>
Start your search for the threesome at the Buckeye Furnace State <br/>
Memorial.  To get there, take State Route #32 to the intersection <br/>
near Wellston where State Route #124 separates from State Route #32.  <br/>
Take State Route #124 east about 4 miles and look for the brown and <br/>
white sign pointing to the Buckeye Furnace State Memorial 3 miles <br/>
down Buckeye Furnace Road.  Follow the signs to the memorial.  (If <br/>
you look carefully, you may see a beaver or two in the wetland along <br/>
the road to the furnace!)  Drive past the furnace and park at the <br/>
picnic area across the road from the company office/store.  Go to the <br/>
barbecue grill.  Take a bearing of 84 and walk 4 paces (1 pace = 2 <br/>
steps).  You should find yourself by the park regulations.  Take a <br/>
bearing of 130 and walk 20 paces to some directional signs.  At the <br/>
directional signs, take a bearing of 214 and go 33 paces to the <br/>
large B.F.S.M. sign.  Standing beside this sign, take a bearing of <br/>
242 and go 35 paces.  You should be standing in front of a quaint <br/>
little red covered bridge.  You'll find the threesome you seek hiding <br/>
under a large fallen log to the left of the bridge hidden by some <br/>
smaller limbs and leaves.<br/>
