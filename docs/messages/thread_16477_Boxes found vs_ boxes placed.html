                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think the 'ideal' number of boxes planted for each box found <br/>
depends on where you live and the number of letterboxers in the <br/>
area. In the poll, I chose as the ideal, 1 box placed for each 4 you <br/>
find, but if I (or anyone else) followed that rule in my area, we'd <br/>
have almost no letterboxes. But if every letterboxer followed that <br/>
4:1 rule in, say, CT, there would be a serious, almost hazardous <br/>
glut of boxes! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
And as to the other poll about how many boxes you have placed vs. <br/>
how many boxes you have found, I chose the one closest to my exact <br/>
numbers.... 1:1. But in reality, I have placed over 2 for each box I <br/>
have found. Really, it all depends on what your situation is in your <br/>
own locality, I think. <br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing!<br/>

PFX # reflected in the poll...meaning someone who has 1000 finds <br/>
might have a different ratio than someone with 50 finds. <br/>
<br/>
Obviously, the higher your PFX, the more "accurate" your ratio will <br/>
be in that you will have shown some endurance to the sport -- the <br/>
same way that major league baseball has a minimum number of at-bats <br/>
to determine leading batting average. Not that this is a race or a <br/>
percentage war, but the theory behind the averages is that it shows <br/>
consistency!<br/>
<br/>
What does this all mean? NOTHING! Some folks plant 1:1, some might <br/>
not. Either way, THANK YOU to everyone who plants boxes!!! Without <br/>
you, there'd be nothing out there to go find!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is true.  When I started letterboxing out here, I had to drive <br/>
hundreds of miles to get more than the two letterboxes that were <br/>
in Eastern ID.  With travel time, persistent effort, and kind <br/>
letterboxer visits, that number is growing slowly.  <br/>
<br/>
Even with these efforts, my plant number is still higher than my <br/>
found number (even though it's close).  I know my PFX count may <br/>
sound pretty sad to those of you with more access to letterboxes, <br/>
but it represents a lot of work and fun times for me.  I also <br/>
believe in the priciple of "if you plant it, they will come." So yes, <br/>
some of us have more plants than finds.<br/>

This is absolutely true. When we started letterboxing<br/>
in Western MA about 16 months ago, there were about 70<br/>
boxes in this part of the state, and about 100 in<br/>
northern CT. Now, those numbers have close to doubled.<br/>
In just the last six months, the number of active<br/>
placers in our area has skyrocketed. It seems to me<br/>
that, once you hit a certain "critical mass" of<br/>
boxers, our sport takes on a life of it's own.<br/>
