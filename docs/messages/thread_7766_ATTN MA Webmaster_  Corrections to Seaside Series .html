                    <div class="plaintext-content">A friend pointed out to us that there is an error in the directions <br/>
for the Fort Phoenix letterbox in the Seaside Series II clues.  The <br/>
faulty part of the current directions reads:<br/>
<br/>
"Then proceed south towards the water. Walk west on a path along the<br/>
 water until you reach the end of the wall. Keep walking (towards the  <br/>
 beach area) until you see a very large flat boulder. Sit on this   <br/>
 boulder. From here, Butler  Flats Lighthouse bears 190 degrees, and a <br/>
 flagpole at the fort bears 280 degrees, and a prominent smokestack    <br/>
 across the harbor in New Bedford bears 236 degrees. Reach down under  <br/>
 the end of the large boulder, and find your reward." <br/>

 Please change this part of the directions to read:<br/>
<br/>
 Then proceed south towards the water.  Walk east on a path <br/>
 along the water until you reach the end of the wall.  Keep walking <br/>
 (towards the beach area)along a sandy path (and/or the grass) until <br/>
 you see a very large, flat boulder.  Sit on this boutlder.  From  <br/>
 here, Butler Flats Lighthouse bears 190 degrees, and a flagpole at  <br/>
 the Fort bears 280 degrees; a prominent smokestack across the harbor  <br/>
 in New Bedford bears 236 degrees.  Reach down under the southeast  <br/>
 corner of the large boulder and find your reward.<br/>
