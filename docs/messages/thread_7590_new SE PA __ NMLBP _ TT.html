For the abbreviationally clueless, I've placed a new mystery box in<br/>
southeastern PA, which is also part of the National Mystery Letterbox<br/>
Project, plus I've written up my Traveler box, which is not a mystery<br/>
box, nor hitchhiker, nor planted in any state (and the abbr. lawyers <br/>
were out of town -- perhaps FB is the right code? :-))<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the mystery box has the text of its clue hidden like on Wheel <br/>
of Fortune; since Vanna was unavailable, the letters have to be found<br/>
in letterboxes and entered on my website to turn them over to reveal<br/>
the clue over time (or they may be revealed in other ways) -- this will <br/>
prolly take a long while to be found ...<br/>

<br/>
The traveler box, which will prolly take just as long, is at <br/>
<br/>
http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box49.html<br/>
<br/>
So as no one is disappointed in the stamps, its BYOS (sorry, only kidding,<br/>
tho I already do have two boxes that are BYOS for the elite stamp <br/>
connoisseur ;-) ("Sunol" and "Beldin's Box"), so no complaining :-))<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

and the need to have found various letterboxes to decipher the <br/>
clues), but the web form with passwords etc is much fancier that I <br/>
had envisions. Too bad PA is so far from us...<br/>
