Hi Banditos - We were looking through our journal<br/>
today and noticed that we had transported your<br/>
hitchhiker and forgotten to send you an email.  We<br/>
found Been to Canaan in the Who's on First box in Dunn<br/>
Loring, VA and replanted him far, far away in early January. <br/>
(We'll tell you where if you want to know - some do,<br/>
some don't.)  The box he went to seems to be visited<br/>
fairly rarely, about once every couple months, so it<br/>
could be a while before you hear from him again.  Cute<br/>
hitchhiker!<br/>

Early Bird,<br/>
I would not know if their address has changed from what they used in <br/>
the HH as I don't have their HH. If you want to figure that out then <br/>
go to search for boxes, search for their name, search for their list <br/>
of letterboxes, click on one and then find their home page "La Casa" <br/>
and you will find that they have posted their address and that they <br/>
are not continuing to remain active in letterboxing.<br/>
