&gt; I am leaving right now to plant this book in the Bull Run Regional <br/>

&gt; the "clues" are too hard.  I have some ideas to change them to make <br/>

&gt; Bull Run Regional Library<br/>
&gt; Prince William County<br/>

&gt; Indoor letterbox book<br/>
&gt; Not easy<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Hey, it's a full moon.  Do you think we'll get any crazies <br/>
tonight?" <br/>
&gt; "What do you mean `we', Michele?  How come `I' always get the <br/>
strange <br/>
&gt; ones?" <br/>
&gt; "Oh, you attract them my dear.  I'm sure." <br/>
&gt; "Yeah right." <br/>
&gt; For some reason Faye did seem to get more than her fair share of <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; people with odd requests, or people who were just plain odd.  But <br/>
&gt; surely, that last full moon was just a coincidence.<br/>
&gt; "Oh great!  Here comes one now," she thought, spying a woman in <br/>
what <br/>
&gt; looked like a cross between an old nun's habit and maybe a nursing <br/>
&gt; outfit. <br/>
&gt; "I am interested in anesthesia and the history of the Crimea."  <br/>
&gt; "Yes Miss"  <br/>
&gt; "You may call me Florence." <br/>
&gt; "...Florence.  Here are a couple of places you can look.  I'll <br/>
write <br/>
&gt; them down for you."  <br/>
&gt; Miss Florence had only just left when a man in a high school band <br/>
&gt; outfit approached her.  "Hello."  "Wait.  Let me guess.  You are <br/>
&gt; looking for `how to' books on band leading?"<br/>
&gt; "Why yes Madame Librarian.  How did you know?"  Faye took off her <br/>
&gt; glasses while she handed him some notes.  He left with a wide smile.<br/>
&gt; In the corner of her eye she sensed rather than saw a dark shape <br/>
&gt; approaching the desk.  She turned to face a tall man in a rough <br/>
dark <br/>
&gt; cloak with a hood.  "Is someone having a costume party," she <br/>
thought <br/>
&gt; to herself, "Where are these people coming from?"<br/>
&gt; It leaned towards her and uttered in a loud, breathy <br/>
&gt; whisper, "Shiiire.  Bagggins." <br/>
&gt; "You must want fi fi fiction.  Under T T T o l," she stuttered in <br/>
&gt; reply.  "Was he ever creepy.  I couldn't even see his face," she <br/>
&gt; shuddered as he glided off. <br/>
&gt; "Excuse me Ma'am, I was hoping you might be able to help me with a <br/>
&gt; little inquiry."  <br/>
&gt; She was smiling at the old fashioned speech before she looked up <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; stifled a laugh.  The stranger's clothes were so old fashioned he <br/>
&gt; looked like a play actor.  <br/>
&gt; "Ma'am?"  <br/>
&gt; "Um, yes.  How may I help you?"  <br/>
&gt; "I am looking for books on Balls Bluff."  <br/>
&gt; "I don't see anything on that subject in the catalog Mr. um..."  <br/>
&gt; "Raines, Harrison Raines, Ma'am."  <br/>
&gt; "...Mr. Raines.  But just because you can't find your subject <br/>
listed <br/>
&gt; specifically, doesn't mean there are no<br/>
&gt; books related to it.  What is Balls Bluff about?  What other <br/>
subjects <br/>
&gt; come to mind?"  <br/>
&gt; He explained his interest and after more catalog searches she wrote <br/>
&gt; down the numbers of the civil war history section, firearms and <br/>
&gt; horses.  <br/>
&gt; "I'm sorry Ma'am I am not familiar with the library.  Might you be <br/>
&gt; free to accompany me and acquaint me with the layout."  <br/>
&gt; "Um, well...why certainly.  I would be glad to."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Michele had noticed that Faye was talking to herself even more than <br/>
&gt; usual tonight.  Then she saw Faye walking back towards the stacks <br/>
&gt; talking to no one next to her and walking as if she were holding <br/>
&gt; someone's arm.  Michele would have laughed if she hadn't been so <br/>
&gt; startled.  "I'll have to see just what Faye's been reading lately."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Note:  You are not looking for a regular commercially printed book <br/>
&gt; that has been hollowed out and made into a letterbox so there is no <br/>
&gt; need to pull all the books off the shelves looking for it.  You are <br/>
&gt; looking for `The Letterbox Book' and should know it when you see <br/>
it.  <br/>
&gt; If you find the letterbox missing or damaged or if you want a hint <br/>
