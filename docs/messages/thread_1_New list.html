This is an experiment with a free talk list that<br/>
Mitch Klink of Oregon told me about.<br/>
Here is the e-mail address of the newly<br/>
created talk list:<br/>
mailto:letterbox-usa@egroups.com<br/>
<br/>
More free lists can be created.<br/>
<br/>
It works the same as other talk lists<br/>
according to what I've been told.<br/>
We'll see how this one goes in the next few days.<br/>
According to Mitch, it will be virtually<br/>
the same as other exclusive lists, except free.<br/>
<br/>
I had the option of leaving it unmoderated, which<br/>
I did, and of leaving it open to anyone which I <br/>
also did.  The list of members is open to all<br/>
members also, and not just me.<br/>
<br/>
See you!<br/>

  &gt; &gt; according to what I've been told.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; We'll see how this one goes in the next few days.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; According to Mitch, it will be virtually<br/>
  &gt; &gt; the same as other exclusive lists, except free.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; I had the option of leaving it unmoderated, which<br/>
  &gt; &gt; I did, and of leaving it open to anyone which I <br/>
  &gt; &gt; also did. The list of members is open to all<br/>
  &gt; &gt; members also, and not just me.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; See you!<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Dan'<br/>

I still remember going back to our first find 3 times before we found <br/>
the clues to the bonus box in the back of the logbook.<br/>

Is being on this one and the new list the most informative?  One is not <br/>
replacing the other, correct?  <br/>
<br/>
I tried emailing a letterboxer wondering if their boxes were still <br/>
around as they had listed on the site, but hadn't been updated for a <br/>
few years, and never heard back.  So do you just head out and see if <br/>
they're still there?<br/>

<br/>
Why not go out and see if you can find the letterboxes without trying <br/>
to contact placers. Sometimes the thrill is in the finding without <br/>
help.<br/>
