Is this LB still there.  We finally got to this area today and was <br/>
not able to follow the clues,  the Red and White traisl did not seem <br/>
to be where you indicate.<br/>
<br/>
And there were a number of "girdled" trees.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks]<br/>

&gt; From I-90, go to Washington Avenue Extension (west of CrossGates <br/>
Mall). Take this highway till it ends at Route 155 (New Karner Road). <br/>
Continue on straight through the traffic signal and Washington Avenue <br/>
Ext. becomes Madison Avenue Extension. Continue through the 3-way <br/>
stop to the end of the road You will pass the water tower. Park here. <br/>
There are maps of the area trails available at a kiosk at the <br/>
entrance.  See map at: <br/>
http://nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/newyork/eastern/pres<br/>
erves/art7467.html<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On this map you are at trail head #7.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At the kiosk follow the trail straight ahead, marked white.  <br/>
Continue for a little ways and the trail will fork, take the red <br/>
trail to your left.  Continue on this trail, The trail will turn <br/>
sharply left again, shortly after this turn look for three girdled* <br/>
trees on your left.Near the girdled trees is a red trail marker.  <br/>
Beyond the girdled trees you will see two pitch pines growing very <br/>
closely together, the box you seek is safely held between the two <br/>
trunks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy Hunting!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; *Girdled trees are trees whose bark has been peeled from their <br/>
trunks.  This is done to get rid of the invasive species that have <br/>
changed the Pine Bush habitat over the years. Obviously, I will have <br/>
to come up with a new landmark when these trees have fallen.  When <br/>
you find the box, look around and see if you can give me some ideas <br/>
for a better clue!<br/>
