something about your post made me think that perhaps you weren't <br/>
aware you could click on the purple dots next to the town names.  <br/>
This will give you more clues.<br/>
<br/>
Webmasters, would it make sense to have instructions under the map?  <br/>
It may not be as obvious as it seems to the rest of us.<br/>

For what it's worth, I have had two friends who didn't realize they<br/>
had <br/>
to click on the purple dots to access the clues. <br/>
