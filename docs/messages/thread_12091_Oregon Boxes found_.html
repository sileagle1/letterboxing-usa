easy ones at the moment because we are tagging along with our dear <br/>
daughter who is not quite 2 now.  <br/>
<br/>
So far we have found the "little peoples" that was so fun and so <br/>
cool, thank you for placing this box, it is alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
The Cannon Beach box was a lovely hike and is in good shape.  There <br/>
is even a stamp there from Africa!  this was our first find and it <br/>
was so exciting!  The stamp is great!<br/>
<br/>
We have begun the Tualitin Park Nature series.  Found box 2 and 4,  <br/>
boxes 2,6 and 7 appear to be gone, still looking for 4, 5 and 8!  <br/>
This is such a great place for the litle ones!  But very busy and <br/>
hard to keep descreet at times, afternoons are the best time we find <br/>
it's quiet then.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps someone!  And I can't wait to do a box of our own!  <br/>
