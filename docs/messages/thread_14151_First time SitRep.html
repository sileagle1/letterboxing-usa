                    <div class="plaintext-content">My fiancee and I just discovered the letterboxing website and decided to try it the other day... Man oh man was it fun... We reside in Tacoma Washington, so our first attempt was only a few blocks away at the Spanaway Park.  Got turned around the first time, but reset and tried again, discovering the box then.  What a thrill.  We went yesterday to Ft. Steilacoom on the Steilacoom Six Search (My name for it!) and we had a Wonderful Time!!!!!  We went that afternoon and got some supplies for hiking, a backpack and some other things (Can't be too prepared, I always say) and then we went and got started. We arrived at approx 5:30 pm and headed off. The first one, The Insane Asylum Letterbox was fairly easy. The second one turned us around and around but we didn't give up and after an hour of seaching, we figured out the clues and found the Heath Farm Letterbox.  The next one was easier, and within 1/2 hour we discovered the Cemetary Letterbox.  The fourth one, the Purple Pumpkin Letterbox was awesome, by then we had started to understand the clues and how to pay attention to landmarks and such and we went right to the spot, and after a few minutes of searching, discovered it.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the disappointments.. #5 and #6 had been reported as missing on the site, but we looked anyways and, alas, I must report that they are in fact missing in action.  The Model Boat Letterbox (#5) and the Leschi Gallow Letterbox (#6) are gone.Overall though we're hooked!  I've started to plan on places for my boxes, I've got 8 prepped and we'll put them out next weekend and let everyone know they are there.... As soon as we get the Membership thing started at the Letterbox USA site, seems thier email is not working.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, this is the introduction for Ravenhaus (Steve, Kris, Steve Jr and Shelby) and we are, by god, hooked!!!<br/>

<br/>
**Sorry about the missing boxes--haven't had a chance yet to check <br/>
on Leschi Gallows.  <br/>
<br/>
**There's a Letterboxing Message Group specifically for the Pacific <br/>
Northwest.  Feel free to check it out under Yahoo Groups--LbPNW.  <br/>
There are also several other 'unique' letterboxing message groups, <br/>
too--travelers (for reporting hitchhiker letterboxes), IALC, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
**There's also a letterboxing 'weekend campout' gathering near <br/>
Portland, OR this weekend.  It starts Friday around 4pm and will <br/>
continue until Sunday afternoon.  People are either camping there <br/>
the entire weekend or dropping by whenever they have the chance.  A <br/>
great opportunity to collect lots of new letterbox and letterboxers' <br/>
stamps.  You can really boost your PFX count by attending one of <br/>
these--not to mention getting the great chance to meet other cool &amp; <br/>
interesting letterboxers from around the region.  <br/>
<br/>
**Finally, if you locate any of my boxes (or come up short for that <br/>
matter), feel free to post any comments about the boxes on the <br/>
www.leecomputers.com/letterboxing website.  Most of my letterboxes <br/>
in the Pac NW will shortly become orphaned letterboxes as we'll be <br/>
relocating in a couple of months so the message board is about the <br/>
only way I'll be able to keep any semblance of a running tab on the <br/>
status of our boxes in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Again, welcome aboard!  It's always great to learn of new <br/>
letterboxers in our region!  Especially since we've barely scratched <br/>
the surface of finding neat little parks/locales around the Tacoma <br/>
area that would serve as opportune hosts for letterboxes!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Take care &amp; hope to see you along the letterboxing trails someday <br/>
soon,<br/>

I'm Wild Woman, from Oregon City, and I'd like to add my greetings to those <br/>
offered by dvn2r ckr, and add a few details: the PNW list-serve is located at <br/>
groups.yahoo.com/group/LbPNW  You can read the messages there, and if you sign <br/>
up, you can also send some.  <br/>
<br/>
You are VERY welcome to attend this weekend's gathering at Milo McIver State <br/>
Park here in Oregon.  Several of us regional letterboxers will be meeting each <br/>
other for the first time there--and there are at least 13 boxes awaiting you <br/>
in the park.  I'll cut and paste in the most recent e-mails about the <br/>
gathering--and hope to see you there!:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oregon Gathering:<br/>
<br/>
Milo McIver Rubber Stamp Camp Out<br/>
<br/>
Estacada, Oregon<br/>
<br/>
July 11 - 13, 2003<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a reminder that the Portland Oregon area gathering will soon<br/>
<br/>
take place at Milo McIver State Park in Estacada, Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We'll be at Group Camp H2 and, per Funhog, the name it's under is<br/>
<br/>
"Rubber Stamp Camp Out". We've got the group camp for Friday, July<br/>
<br/>
11th from 4:00 pm that day to Sunday, July 13th at 1:00 pm, I<br/>
<br/>
believe. This is a tent area that can take 25 campers. For those<br/>
<br/>
not camping there is a Day Use Fee of, I believe $3.00. Campers can<br/>
<br/>
just tell them at the booth that they are part of the Rubber Stamp Camp<br/>
<br/>
Out at H2 and you shouldn't have to pay to get in at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Events planned so far are Friday Night Potluck at 6:00 pm and into the<br/>
<br/>
evening.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Saturday the Paisley Orca will have a carving demo at 1:00pm.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There may be pinatas.  One for kids and one for adults, but this is just<br/>
<br/>
a fantasy so far and not quite written in stone just yet.  My brother<br/>
<br/>
suggested it since his kids love whacking papier mache at birthday<br/>
<br/>
parties, apparently.  Also, anything else you can think of...We can have<br/>
<br/>
a goody swap, if you would like, as well.  Bring erasers, or<br/>
<br/>
letterboxing accessories to trade/giveaway.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO DO SOMETHING OR HAS SUGGESTIONS, PLEASE LET ME<br/>
<br/>
KNOW.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
MILO MCIVER STATE PARK GENERAL DRIVING DIRECTIONS FROM I-205 <br/>
