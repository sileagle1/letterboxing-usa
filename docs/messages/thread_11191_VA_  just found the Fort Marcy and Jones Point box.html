                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was pleased as punch to log on and find out that Scarab of the <br/>
Doubtful Guests had just posted clues to the Fort Marcy Box.  Hmmm, <br/>
clues posted last night - probably no one had gone hunting yet.  <br/>
Soooo, just thought I'd pop down and try to find it.  <br/>
<br/>
Eureka!!!!  I was the first one to stamp into the log book.  First <br/>
time I've ever done that.<br/>
<br/>
Scarab - VERY nice stamp!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And last weekend, I found the Jones Point Lighthouse stamp.  I had <br/>
ventured out earlier than that, but the near flood conditions at the <br/>
park from the melting snow deterred me.  I should have gotten my <br/>
feet wet.  When I finally got to the box, alas, I was the second <br/>
person to stamp in.  "Shoe" beat me.  But I gotta tell ya, Music <br/>
Woman:  That is an awesome stamp!  I'm quite impressed.<br/>
<br/>
Well, next week, I'm heading out to Arizona for training, so I've <br/>
got a whole sheaf of AZ letterbox clues I'm taking with me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
