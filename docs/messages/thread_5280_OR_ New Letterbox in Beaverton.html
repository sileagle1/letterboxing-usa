BURNTWOOD LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
Dropped:  On May 6th, 2002, by A.Rose and The Vet.<br/>
Location:  Beaverton, Washington County, Oregon.<br/>
Path:  Paved but very hilly.<br/>
Clue:  Moving toward clever.<br/>
Misc:  This might be defined as a microbox.  (We used a 1/2 cup container).  <br/>
Be sure to bring a pen and stamp pad.<br/>
<br/>
Don Quixote dropped by to call on us in Beaverton the other day.  He began <br/>
weaving a tale about why he had been so delayed.  Something about a <br/>
mysterious Land of Burntwood and some modern day giants he encountered.  The <br/>
four-legged ones plagued him with memories of monsters from long ago.  <br/>
Worried for the fair Dulcinea, he engaged in battle with one and then the <br/>
other.  He says he accidentally let fall his satchel of spoils at the feet of <br/>
one of these monstrous giants.  This is where his tale begins to unravel a <br/>
bit, for Don Quixote declared that he won the battle despite losing his <br/>
fortunes at the feet of his evil foe.  Before we could question him further, <br/>
he was off to continue his adventures.  Poor Don Quixote, we can still see <br/>
the monsters standing there undefeated when we pass by. <br/>
<br/>
Please contact ARoseLB@aol.com to report any problems with the letterbox and <br/>
to add any comments about its discovery!  Woohoo!<br/>
