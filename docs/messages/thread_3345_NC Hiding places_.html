                    <div class="plaintext-content">Fortunately, the area around my part of North Carolina (the western-most, <br/>
mountainous area) is absolutely LOADED with perfect hiding places!  I invite <br/>
one and all to invade and plant away!  There are lots of trails and <br/>
side-trails, lots and lots of old, live trees with exposed roots and <br/>
hollows, and jillions of crevasses, caves, and rocks.  I haven't planted as <br/>
many as I thought I would by now, but still hope to get another half-dozen <br/>
seeded before I am forced south for the winter.<br/>
