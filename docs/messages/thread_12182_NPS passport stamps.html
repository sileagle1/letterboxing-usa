<br/>
<br/>
<snip>  I have been wondering if many others collect the NPS passport stamps.  I was <br/>
  into that before I discovered letterboxing.  I plan on keeping both up.  It's not <br/>
  uniquely personal like our stamps are, and the element of the hunt is not there, but <br/>
  I've seen places I would have never gone if it weren't for the stamp hunting and the <br/>
  memories are personal.<snip><br/>
<br/>
  I've been collecting NPS stamps for a few years (not that many collected though). <br/>
  Sometimes it can be  a bit of a hunt to get the stamps you want. There are some that <br/>
  are really hard to get because of the location or ones that are only available at certain <br/>
  times of year. There's a nice group on MSN that started recently and a good <br/>
  discussion board at eParks.com. They're good for learning about new parks and <br/>
  obscure stamps.<br/>
