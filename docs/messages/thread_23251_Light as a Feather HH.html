my post or email me?  I found this stamp, and tried to contact you to let you know about <br/>
it, but the email address left with it bounced back.<br/>
<br/>
I am contacting Wanda and Pete so that they can update their list, but I figured that you <br/>
might like to know about it as well.  Thanks much!<br/>
