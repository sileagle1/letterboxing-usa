We'd planned on replacing our first ever planted letterboxes with the new<br/>
camouflage techniques that had been discussed and bandied about here and now<br/>
we have no choice.  (chuckles)  Ah well, we look at it as a chance to<br/>
replace our first ever planted letterboxes with new ones, and, since our<br/>
carving ability has gotten better (We hope), perhaps with better boxes.<br/>
<br/>
We shall see.<br/>

P.S. I made a mistake when I typed the letter, it was 40% losses not 60%. We<br/>
recovered 6 out of the 10 yesterday, not 4 out of the 10.  Sorry folks.<br/>

Hmm - I've never camoflauged my boxes. Excluding the recent microbox series, I've <br/>
placed around 60 boxes. To my (current) knowledge - none of them are missing. <br/>
(Lavender is still roaming and considered missing in action - but not gone!) This tally also <br/>
includes 4 out-of-state boxes currently maintained by myself, 2 in public libraries, one in <br/>
a secluded yet very urban public garden, and various others that I consider "well placed".<br/>
<br/>
When it comes right down to it, you've got to consider that even camo won't protect your <br/>
box from ruthless visitors and hungry wildlife if the original placement of the box was not <br/>
well thought out. My only advice to new letterboxers that are placing out there is to scout <br/>
out your location very well. It is like anything else in life, if you do it right the first time, <br/>
there is a good chance you won't end up redoing it in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
Think quality not quantity.<br/>

better, both in the carving area and in the placement.<br/>

Steve, you might make bloody-awful websites, but your carving <br/>
ability has never been in doubt.  I don't think you could carve a <br/>
bad-looking stamp if you tried.  =)<br/>
