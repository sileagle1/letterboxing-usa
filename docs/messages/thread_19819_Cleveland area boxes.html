My son and I are heading from Pittsburgh to the Cleveland zoo for a  day.  <br/>
I'd like to hit one box in the area - does anyone have  recommendations for any <br/>
that are fairly close to the zoo (or the  turnpike)?  We'd appreciate one that <br/>
wouldn't take terribly long to  do - we won't have a ton of time, but I know <br/>
he'd enjoy boxing while there  if we can fit it in!  Thanks in advance for any <br/>
help!<br/>

The easiest box I have found in Cleveland is called "Funshine Bear" <br/>
in Berea. It isn't too far off Interstate 71. I'm not sure where it <br/>
is in relation to the zoo since I'm not a Clevelander- just go there <br/>
occasionally to letterbox. You can find "Funshine Bear" in 5 minutes <br/>
once you locate the park it's in. <br/>
