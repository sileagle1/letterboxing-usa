Location -  Snoqualmie Falls<br/>
State - Washington<br/>
County - King<br/>
Town - Snoqualmie<br/>
<br/>
Clues  Easy.  Straight forward directions.<br/>
<br/>
Trek - Moderate to Hard.  This is a steep, but sort (half mile) <br/>
climb, first down then back up.  There are several resting places <br/>
with benches.  Make sure to pace yourself, and bring water.<br/>
<br/>
Time to complete - 1 to 2 hours (depending on hiker's speed and how <br/>
much you `play' at the bottom)<br/>
<br/>
Notes:  <br/>
This is a very busy and popular tourist area.  Box #2 is hidden well <br/>
off the trail.  However, boxes 1 and 3 are off the beaten path, but <br/>
within view of trail walkers, this should not be a problem so long as <br/>
you don't look too conspicuous.  Everyone is far to busy with their <br/>
touristy agendas to pay much attention to you.<br/>

I can't wait, but one question.......<br/>
<br/>
Last time I saw moderate it was on the Rattlesnake Ledge box.<br/>
<br/>
This old man thought he was going to die! I made it but with many rest<br/>
stops.<br/>
<br/>
Have you been to Rattlesnake Ledge? How does this compare in steepness?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again !<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">LOL Glen, Well I rated Moderate to Hard.  I haven't done Rattlesnake <br/>
lake, but I'm guessing that would be `Very Hard' in my book... I <br/>
should do that box soon, just so I have a point of reference.<br/>
<br/>
This hike has about 3 steep inclines broken up by a couple of flatter <br/>
areas.  I was able to make these inclines, sometimes stopping halfway <br/>
up to rest and definitely stopping at the top to catch my breath  <br/>
(usually with nice benches there!)<br/>
<br/>
I'm finding difficulty ratings hard to do.  As I am a outta shape, <br/>
slightly overweight, 30-somthing woman.  I'd rate this as Hard, where <br/>
as my very fit husband would probably rate it as Moderate.  I <br/>
chose "Moderate to Hard" figuring the 'fit' folk would find it <br/>
Moderate, and the 'less then fit' folk would see it as Hard.  The <br/>
plus side is, it's very short. (half mile)<br/>
<br/>
I've read the reports from others that have been to Rattlesnake, and <br/>
judging from what they've said, it isn't nearly that bad.  =)<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could give you a more concrete answer.  I'd love to hear <br/>
what you think if/when you go... these are my first boxes, so be <br/>
gentle. =D<br/>

The hike is only about a half a mile compared with 1.4 at Rattlesnake <br/>
and there are little benches all along the way for rest stops!!  I <br/>
agree that Rattlesnake is grueling!  The hike to the viewpoint at <br/>
Larrabee State Park is also challenging, but it is only about a mile <br/>
and again there are benches along the way.<br/>
