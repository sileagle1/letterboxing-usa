<br/>
 Ohio,Ross County ~Seip Mound is 14 miles Southwest of Chillicothe,Ohio<br/>
and 2 miles East<br/>
of Bainbridge,Ohio on U.S. 50 .<br/>

 Seip Mound is the central mound in a group of geometric earthworks.<br/>
Farming and erosion have degraded the surrounding earthworks leaving the<br/>
central mound an outstanding feature. It is 240 feet long, 130 feet<br/>
wide, and 30 feet high. <br/>
Excavations have revealed that prehistoric Indian buildings existed near<br/>
the earthworks. Today, visitors can see the location of some of these<br/>
buildings as they are outlined by short posts in the ground. The<br/>
Hopewell Indians (100 BC-AD 500) built Seip Mound for burials. This<br/>
culture had a highly developed craft industry, as is evidenced by<br/>
artifacts found with bodies in the burial site. <br/>

What is "Loffelstein" you ask ?<br/>
The Loffelstein retaining wall system is based on attractive precast<br/>
concrete units that stack and interlock by friction to create a gravity<br/>
style retaining wall. Concerns for the environment are met by this plant<br/>
able wall. Their graceful designs that can be achieved by building the<br/>
wall in convex or concave curvatures, as well as terraced, and planted<br/>
with a variety of flowers or ivy, makes it a truly living wall. The wall<br/>
becomes an integral part of the landscaping and overall environment.<br/>
<br/>

*****************************************************<br/>
I received  a report that the stamp was missing for the Hammel Pond box<br/>
.So I created another.When I got to the letterbox to replace it  the<br/>
latest entry stated: "we found the stamp,but we had to dig for it ".So<br/>
the box is safe and sound.( w/stamp )<br/>
Can never have too many Hammel Pond boxes ...so I made Hammel Pond II<br/>
!!<br/>
******************************************************<br/>
Clues:<br/>
See :Hammel Pond clues also..<br/>
Walk on trail past the Ranger Station.<br/>
Just over the hill walking West  is <br/>
Hammel Pond.<br/>
After coming to the edge of the pond go due North ( CCW ) around the<br/>
pond.<br/>
At the 5th bench take a heading of 280 from the left side of the<br/>
bench <br/>
( as you sit on the bench.)<br/>
About 3 paces off the paved path is a small tree.<br/>
(a pace= 2 steps; about 5 feet )<br/>
Hammel Pond II is behind the tree.<br/>
This box is pretty much exposed in the open.<br/>
Be careful of non-boxers.... <br/>
<br/>
Please mail me if you find the box.<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
