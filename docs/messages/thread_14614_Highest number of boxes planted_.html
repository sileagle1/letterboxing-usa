My first letterbox plant was in 2001 called Pigs Can't Fly <br/>
(Cincinnati has a thang about flying pigs )  Anyway it was a purchased<br/>
stamp . The box was taken last week and now it has been replaced with a<br/>
carved stamp .<br/>
<br/>
I missed seeing all the last few entries .That makes me more angry than<br/>
the missing letterbox .<br/>
You can always replace the box ,but I will never see the last few<br/>
comments . <br/>
Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
So now~ ALL ~ my letterboxes have hand carved stamps in them. I know my<br/>
count is at 177 placed ,but That's low because of all the replacement<br/>
stamps ,and HitchHikers ,And Postal letterboxes etc,etc that weren't<br/>
counted.<br/>
So all and all I have almost 200 carved stamps placed. That's my tale,<br/>
and I'm stickin' to it !<br/>
