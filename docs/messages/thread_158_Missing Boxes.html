  On the boxes going missing issue. It has happened many<br/>
  times over here. We have had one or two cases of deliberate<br/>
  vandalism but most are taken by ordinary people who do not know<br/>
  what they are - a sort of holiday souvenir. Stick a label inside the<br/>
  lid explaining that the box is put out for many people's pleasure<br/>
  and that taking it or destroying it will cause people wasted time<br/>
  and effort. Include your phone number so and tell people to ring<br/>
  you if they want to know more. This is how I got started.<br/>

<br/>
        1.  Who do you contact if you think a box is missing?  (Today, I went<br/>
        looking for the Fort Adams box in RI and couldn't find it.  That<br/>
        doesn't mean it's not there, but there were a large number of beer <br/>
cans.)<br/>
       2.  Is there a way of getting clues that register as error messages <br/>
when<br/>
         you try to link to them?  (In particular Cliff Walk and Canonchet's<br/>
         Waters in RI)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, Debbie! Fort Adams could have disapeared (again: it's been <br/>
vandalized once and graciously replaced by BobH).<br/>
<br/>
Here are the clues for Canonchet's:<br/>
<br/>
Canonchet's Waters<br/>
<br/>
Canonchet was a 17th Century native leader whose descendants still <br/>
people this area. Because of its great natural beauty, this is a busy <br/>
trail, and evidence that it is still held sacred exists in the fact <br/>
that it is a registered natural landmark. There are two letterboxes <br/>
here. In Ashaway RI, take exit 2 from I-95, and head briefly north to <br/>
connect with RI Rte. 3. Turn left, south, for half a mile, then turn <br/>
right on Canonchet Rd. Heading north for 2 miles, pass an exquisite <br/>
church, an old mill site that is still in use, and Ashville Pond, <br/>
before parking in the hiker's lot on your left hand side.<br/>
<br/>
This hike will follow the yellow blazed Narragansett Trail, and can <br/>
be done two ways. As a "Y" shaped hike, you'll follow two out-and-<br/>
back forks connected in the middle by a short stem to the parking <br/>
area. Or, if you prefer, you can add quiet country road walking to <br/>
each segment and call it a figure eight. Either way, this is quite a <br/>
strenuous hike over steep up and down trails, covering 5-6 miles in 2-<br/>
3 hours. Bring a picnic, a camera for the great views, and your <br/>
stronger children.<br/>
<br/>
Walk in south from the parking area past an old root cellar to the <br/>
fork in the trail. We'll start by heading left, southwest, through a <br/>
long tunnel of mountain laurel towards Ashville Pond. After about a <br/>
mile, begin descending a hill through a series of stone walls. Come <br/>
to an open area of slickrock gneiss formation, strewn randomly with <br/>
chest high boulders. The trail will turn sharply right (west): <br/>
continue straight on a course of 130 for about 25 steps to the <br/>
southeastern edge of this slickrock clearing. The Ashville Pond <br/>
Letterbox is hidden on the left behind the northeast corner of a knee <br/>
high rock. Stamp in, and invest a couple of minutes to continue down <br/>
the Narragansett Trail to Ashville Pond, and a charmingly defunct <br/>
picnic area with a sandy beach. Now, you can double back to retrace <br/>
your steps to the parking area fork. Or, you can continue up a few <br/>
steps to the road, turn left down the road, and then left again at a <br/>
very old house, to pass an old canal to Ashville Pond, the fishing <br/>
area, and continue back to the trail head.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the spectacular leg. Turn right at the fork and follow the <br/>
Narragansett Trail westerly along the cliffs overlooking Long Pond. <br/>
There will be rugged up and down climbing on waterside ledges with <br/>
rewarding views the whole way, as well as a variety of splendid rock <br/>
formations. Near the end of the pond, cross north over the boggy area <br/>
and then climb up well placed steps in an extraordinary cleft in the <br/>
stone. At the top you'll find a trail junction: from the sign go <br/>
generally east along the ridge on an unmarked trail. There are a <br/>
couple of overlooks facing easterly across the water to the cliffs <br/>
you just traversed. On the second, sandy one, is the Long Pond <br/>
Letterbox. Standing on the promontory's edge with Long Pond to your <br/>
left and a communications antenna bearing 220 degrees, the box is <br/>
tucked into the southern face of an overhanging rock to your right <br/>
(west), just off the trail. This is a good spot to linger after <br/>
stamping in.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, you can traipse back the way you came, enjoying the views <br/>
(and the climbs) from a different perspective in a different light. <br/>
Or, returning to the sign board, turn right with the yellow blazes, <br/>
crossing some more interesting rock arrangements, to a second parking <br/>
lot. Turn right on the dirt road, which in half a mile becomes paved, <br/>
and then right again at an intersection. You'll find your car a <br/>
stretch later, after a picturesque farm. The road piece is pleasantly <br/>
longer, but much less taxing, than the return hike. Both are in the <br/>
footsteps of the great native leader Canonchet.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy!<br/>
Jay in CT<br/>

Thanks for the directions to Canonchet.  I'm going to check again for Fort Adams because I received a message saying that it was there two days before I went looking for it.  Then again I wasn't really dressed appropriately for the climb (conference clothes are not suited for letterboxing ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the info and have a great Thanksgiving.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In my neck of the woods, suburban Chicago, being around the train tracks<br/>
anyplace other than a bonafide crossing (either a vehicle crossing or a<br/>
pedestrian crossing) would be illegal.  I don't know if it's a federal law,<br/>
a state law, county, or even municipal law, but around here folks do get<br/>
arrested for it.  Too many people getting killed by trains from being where<br/>
they don't belong as regards the tracks.  In *my* town, the police are a<br/>
little paranoid about it.<br/>
<br/>
Now, out in the sticks, it's different.  I don't know if the law exists for<br/>
out in the sticks, but if it does, I've never known it to be enforced.  But<br/>
isn't all the land on either side of the tracks considered railroad<br/>
property, and not really to be used by the public?<br/>
<br/>
Things like train tracks, train trestles/bridges, could also be considered<br/>
security risks ever since 9/11, 7/07, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Last Thanksgiving, Pippi had one of her Thanksgiving boxes out under a train<br/>
trestle in an extremely rural area.  But farmers in the area told her there<br/>
should be no problem with it.  'Course, that didn't mean they'd come break<br/>
her out of jail if she got arrested for it.  :-)<br/>

I doubt a letterboxer or geocacher would deliberately<br/>
