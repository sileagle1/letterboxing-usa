                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just returned from a trip to Missouri to visit the inlaws for <br/>
Easter, and checked up on my St.Charles boxes in frontier park. 2 are <br/>
gone...boohoo. I planted them in the snow and ice of February with <br/>
plans to re hide them in spring, but they didn't last. 2 are still in <br/>
place though, so if you are in Missourrri-go get em!<br/>
<br/>
And could someone PLEASE tell me why only the boxes with good stamps <br/>
go missing?! My ugly first ever carving attempt boxes-they've all <br/>
lasted. The really nice ones? Gone. Bleh.<br/>
