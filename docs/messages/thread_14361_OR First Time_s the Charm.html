2003 at Milo McIver State Park in Oregon.<br/>
The stamp was carved during the stamp carving class and is the first <br/>
stamp ever carved by Lucky Charm of Team Garlic. The logbook was made by <br/>
DblTall in the bookbinding class. Many thanks to all the wonderful <br/>
people who made the campout such a fun experience!<br/>

Milo McIver State Park, Estacada, OR<br/>
<br/>
Go east from Group Camp Site H2.<br/>
<br/>
In the clearing, take the trail past the volleyball poles.<br/>
<br/>
12 steps before the trail meets up with the horse trail,<br/>
there is a giant of the forest on your left.<br/>
<br/>
This lucky letterbox is next to the giant in a little grove.<br/>
