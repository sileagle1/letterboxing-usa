&gt; You can wait for it to "grow up" or you can actively nurture it <br/>
along.  You could be the one with a few clues posted on a personal <br/>
blog instead of LbNA or AQ -- there are many free blogging services <br/>
that take very little time and technical know-how to get off the <br/>
ground.  The more you do to coax the hobby, the more that will come <br/>
back to you.  You don't have to resign yourself to waiting for it to <br/>
happen.  Make it happen.  Think of it as an opportunity...<br/>

Good lard, lad - why would I want to do that?  No, I want to <br/>
encourage activity in the area in general, so any plants I create <br/>
will be posted to the two "big lists".  I was simply saying that, <br/>
since starting the hobby last April, I have found almost all the <br/>
listed boxes w/in an hour's drive of home, will probably get the <br/>
last couple this weekend (weather permitting), and, having looked <br/>
around, cannot locate anyone posting clues for this area elsewhere.  <br/>
Which means I'm watching and waiting for new plants to find.  And <br/>
since there are only a few active boxers around here, they are not <br/>
coming with any great frequency.  The locals I have met/corresponded <br/>
with have indicated that yes, they will plant, but not right now - <br/>
busy with family, work, etc.  Which I totally understand...I won't <br/>
be very active come spring because of my job.  It all just means <br/>
that I have a LB itch I cannot scratch.  It's...distracting.<br/>
