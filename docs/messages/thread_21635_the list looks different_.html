I'm a technophobe, so don't understand most of what's being said about "the <br/>
list" looking different.  I'm in digest mode, and everything looks exactly <br/>
the same as it has for years....<br/>

and links and pictures are kept, as well as messages -<br/>
it's quite a bit different.  The changes they made<br/>
don't affect mail delivery (as far as I've been able<br/>
to tell anyway), just the appearance of the list at<br/>
the list site itself.  It really isn't very nice!<br/>
