<br/>
   On our way to Gatlinburg, TN, we found the "There &amp; Back Again" <br/>
Hitchhiker planted by the Drew Clan with the Lord of the Rings <br/>
series of boxes in Carlisle, PA. The Lord of the Rings Series was <br/>
great. Our nieces were so excited. This was our first hitchhiker and <br/>
we were all thrilled to find it on August 10th.<br/>
<br/>
   The Hitchhiker now resides with the Davy Crockett letterbox in a <br/>
park that shares his name in Limestone, TN. It is a great stamp and <br/>
we thoroughly enjoyed finding and having it with us on our vacation <br/>
to Gatlinburg!<br/>

<br/>
Funny thing is- I got an email from someone telling me<br/>
that they left it in Prince of Peace box in Pokomoke<br/>
State Park- though I saw yesterday while checking on<br/>
my boxes- that you said you were headed to Gatlinburg.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Very interesting! But very cool since the Pokomoke<br/>
box gets very little traffic.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for giving him a ride!<br/>
