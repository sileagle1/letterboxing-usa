Three miles from the madding crowds of metro Hot Springs is my favorite <br/>
campground - so under-utilized by the camping public it has almost been <br/>
closed by the USFS.  It is much quieter than its nearest cousins, and <br/>
charming in a CCC sort of way.<br/>
<br/>
Very easy, very short hike with a beautiful long view and the perfect place <br/>
to stamp up.<br/>
<br/>
Drive in and find what Spencer overlooked..  Several paths present <br/>
themselves; not to worry.  Youll get there.  Sit and enjoy the sounds and <br/>
sights and smells.  Then pace left about six.   Thigh-high geometrics make <br/>
the path interesting; above them a roundish form squats above a soft nest, <br/>
twigged and barked to camouflage a souvenir.<br/>
<br/>
Shhhhh....did you catch the Songs?<br/>
