High Knob reported MIA 6/23 by RubyFrog<br/>
Pillar of the Letterboxing Community reported MIA 7/4 by Mahjong<br/>
(this box is hidden in Goose Creek)<br/>
Chillin with the Girls repored MIA 7/14 by Debean<br/>
<br/>
Into the Fire (the other half of Into the Frying Pan) has been moved <br/>
but is still very close to the original site if it has not been <br/>
washed away.  (the stump fell apart in the Spring torrents)<br/>
<br/>
Our hitchhiker Who Moved my Cheese was recently spotted in Oregon <br/>
and.....the most exciting thing that has happened to me in a while...<br/>
<br/>
"Honda Road Again" is on the way back to the ADG!  This was our <br/>
first hitcher and it has seen the whole east coast.  Whoo hoo!<br/>
