Hello Pilgrim,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Went on my very first letterboxing safari yesterday.  Had a wonderful <br/>
time and found two boxes here in Eastern Massachusetts.  My first find <br/>
ever was BorisDM's letterbox at Wareham Rest Area, my second find was <br/>
Mermaid Mom's--The Beetle-- in Wareham, MA and the third one was gone, <br/>
the area is under construction and that letterbox was by <br/>
Dragonfly&amp;BothHands named Plymouth Rock in Plymouth, MA<br/>
This was all done on May 1, 2005.  I emailed the boxes owners to let <br/>
them know that i found the box and it was in tact or let them know the <br/>
area is under construction.  I hope i did this right.  I clicked on the <br/>
little green flag to enter the info but it didn't work.  Don't know why.<br/>
I learned more by finding the boxes.  they had a disclaimer in them, <br/>
ink pen, and ink pad also.  I am still putting my first box together. I <br/>
want it to be special :)  It will be hidden in Plymouth, MA<br/>
Thank you for sending me the other letterboxers sites Don, that was <br/>
thoughtful of you :)<br/>
Happy Letterboxing To All<br/>

You need to use the img tag to insert an image on a page, rather than<br/>

Hope that helps.<br/>
