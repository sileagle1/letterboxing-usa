been there -- that would definitely get around the problem that I have been <br/>
encountering, trying to find spots to hide boxes in metro DC where they <br/>
won't be removed.  It would be much easier to just place the stamp, at <br/>
times.  And people who find it would have the image, although I wouldn't <br/>
have theirs.<br/>
<br/>
What does everyone else think about that??<br/>

<br/>
...I have been thinking about urban letterboxes and am very concerned with <br/>
the<br/>
box being found and removed by non-letter boxes. I also thought it would be <br/>
fun to put a letter box in places like Disneyland.<br/>
That would be tough because They would actively try to remove it or there<br/>
would be such high traffic it would be found.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking in situations like that you could put up a journalless box,<br/>
it would just be the stamp. and the stamp could be glued into place. so <br/>
that<br/>
it couldn't be easily noticed. i.e. glued to an out of the way section of<br/>
cave roof on Tom-Sawyers island, or under a chair on the Mark Twain. What <br/>
do<br/>
you guys think?<br/>
