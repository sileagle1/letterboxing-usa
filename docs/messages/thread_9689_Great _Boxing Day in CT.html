following letterboxes, which were all in great shape and we <br/>
thoroughly enjoyed them. They were all beautifully carved stamps:<br/>
<br/>
The Christmas Mystery Letterbox<br/>
You Otter Seet This Letterbox<br/>
Paddle to the Sea Letterbox<br/>
Christmas Around the World [Series of 6]<br/>
<br/>
Much to our surprise, we were the first to find the "Bohemian <br/>
Traveler" Hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
We did have one strike-out, World War 1 Silent Night. We found the <br/>
foundation of the old building and the flat rock, but couldn't find <br/>
the proper tree with the 2 rocks. We looked for about 45 minutes and <br/>
it started to get dark. Might try again in the spring.<br/>
<br/>
The Pepe's and the Davidow's<br/>
