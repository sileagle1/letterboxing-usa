I don't receive email on this group anymore because I don't have enough time <br/>
to keep up. Quite a while ago I mentioned that I was abandoning the <br/>
letterboxing.com name and offered it to someone to develop. No one ever <br/>
contacted me, and I did not renew my ownership. To my distress I see it has <br/>
been scooped up by one of those domain prospecting companies. Too bad, <br/>
now if someone wants to do something with it you will likely have to pay <br/>
considerable bucks to get it.  <br/>
<br/>
I also noticed that my Titusville Blackpoint box is listed as missing due to <br/>
flood. I doubt it would have flooded high enough to reach it in the tree where it <br/>
should be placed. I will check on it next time I am out there and report if I find <br/>
it. If anyone wishes to contact me about any of my boxes, please do it directly <br/>
as I only check this group activity very rarely. Best wishes to all. <br/>
