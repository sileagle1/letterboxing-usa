Chief Kno-Tah Mystery Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Status: Alive and Well as of 03/17/03<br/>
<br/>
The Chief Kno-Tah Mystery Letterbox was placed on March 17, 2003 by <br/>
Brett in Hillsboro, OR.<br/>
<br/>
TERRAIN:<br/>
Drive up.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES (Difficult?):<br/>
<br/>
(There are no clues for this letterbox  see note)<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: A few months back I became fascinated with short, minimalist <br/>
letterbox clues. I decided that I wanted to hide a box with such <br/>
clues. I thought the ultimate would be a clue with only one word. I <br/>
found a location where a one-word clue would suffice, and even be <br/>
pretty easy, but alas no good hiding place existed at the location. <br/>
Later I thought that just a letter or number would be better than one <br/>
word. Something like the `W' in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. Then <br/>
I realized that the ultimate minimalist clue would be no clue at all. <br/>
Of course finding a suitable hiding spot that could be found without <br/>
a clue was the challenge. So I pondered for several months before <br/>
realizing I could use the same place I had intended for the one-word <br/>
clue box. And having seen and read about some clever ways others have <br/>
hidden boxes; I was able to figure out a way to hide a box at the <br/>
location. <br/>
<br/>
NOTE: This box is findable. There are no hidden hints in this post. <br/>
Hidden hints may appear from time to time elsewhere but no hints are <br/>
needed to find this box.<br/>
