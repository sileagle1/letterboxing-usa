<br/>
  In October, Letterboxing was taken away from me, and I want to get back to it this Spring.<br/>
<br/>
  I did learn a lesson form this and hope nobody else has this happen to them<br/>
  I wear an old fanny pack for hiking sometimes (also use it in dog training and on vacation).  I took it with me to introduce my boyfriend to Letterboxing on a short trail in Iowa.  It was a short, fun search and we stamped up rather quickly to get back to the car before we could be eaten alive by mosquitoes.  I left that stupid sweaty fanny pack in my car that evening, containing my stamp, my logbook, inkpad, wipes, and a nice Suunto compass, one pair of dirty socks (yum), and my spare car key.<br/>
<br/>
  Well, that night, my car was broken into and the pack was stolen along with other things.  I couldnt care less about some CDs, a leather bag the thieves probably sold, but why oh WHY must someone take personal things that cannot be replaced?  Unfortunately, the thieves came back to steal my car the night before I had an appointment to have it re-keyed.  And they wrote bad checks.  There is more to this nightmare, but suffice it to say, I felt very violated and upset that my silly little eraser and logbook with stamps were taken.  The checks were taken care of, they were able to recover my car and repair everything, and I am to meet next week with the criminal who was picked up driving it.  The Victim Offender Reconciliation Program is a form of restorative justice, and restitution &amp; closure will help.  I wonder if my fanny pack, stamp and logbook went into a dumpster or landfill, and I know it didnt mean anything to the thieves, but as you all know, it meant something to me.  I<br/>
 was unemployed when all of this went down, and I learned to never leave anything of value (monetary or sentimental) in my car again.<br/>
<br/>
  Things are beginning to look up with a new job, a wonderful relationship, and the prospect of Spring.   I havent felt much like carving a new stamp, but I will.  I will get to hike again.<br/>
<br/>
  I am relatively new to Letterboxing.  I did have the pleasure of hearing that my Ireland box was found last Spring.  I now no longer have that stamp image, but I know it's out there!<br/>
<br/>
  First off, it is unfortunate there arent oodles of LBs in my area (but Iowa is gaining more!  A special thanks to FunHog  keep em coming!).  Next, I was disappointed when the first letterbox I placed was stolen, and after this, now I have to start all over.  I understand this is the nature of such a hobby  there is risk in box vandalism and theft, hazards on the trail, and whatnot.  Just wish some stupid person hadnt ruined the rest for me.  Drop a line if you wish (wolfmoonproductions@yahoo.com) or if you have ideas on how to make a new start special and meaningful. Perhaps I will commemorate it with a special theme box.  J<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you for reading my story, and never leave your letterboxing gear  even in your locked vehicle!<br/>
<br/>
  Happy Hunting!!!<br/>

<br/>
Unfortunate story, but I'm glad in the end things are looking better<br/>
-- and that you will be heading back out on the hunt this spring!<br/>
<br/>
When I first discovered letterboxing in June 2004, I participated in<br/>
the hobby rather fervidly with my then GF.  Unforunately, we ended our<br/>
relationship that October.  The combination of the facts that I had<br/>
only known this hobby with her as my partner and that I tend not to<br/>
like doing things by myself caused me to stop letterboxing altogether<br/>
during the winter.  But I missed the hobby greatly and forced myself<br/>
to find a way to get back into it.  Thanks in large part to my friend<br/>
Warrior Woman, who pulled me back out on the trails, I once again<br/>
found myself active in this hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Since then I've made some new letterboxing friends and gone 'boxing<br/>
with them (and am always trying to make more letterboxing "dates"),<br/>
have learned to enjoy 'boxing by myself and am working on getting my<br/>
current GF to come with me on a few hikes (although I'm fairly well<br/>
convinced she'll not become a letterboxer herself).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, welcome back to the hobby and enjoy your time!<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
CPAScott<br/>

You will have the best letterboxing partner and friend for life you could ever hope for. I thank my lucky stars every day for Dude the Wonder Dog. He got me into letterboxing by making me get off my fat butt and take him on long walks in the woods after I adopted him. It was on one of those walks we discovered a letterbox not very well re-hidden and our adventures began. Adopt a shelter dog, you'll never be sorry....<br/>

Sorry to read of your sad &amp; cautionary tale, but glad to hear you <br/>
plan to return to this fun hobby.  Wisconsin is "just next door" and <br/>
if you have time in early June, we'd love to have you join us at a <br/>
gathering planned for Saturday June 3.  You'd have an opprtunity to <br/>
hike some great trails, meet lots of other boxers, and find plenty of <br/>
boxes.  It might be a fun way to kickoff your return to <br/>
letterboxing.  You can find more details about the event here:<br/>

P.S. I planted one box in Iowa last June, but it is on the eastern <br/>
edge of the state.  Not sure where you are located...<br/>

Oh, the tales I could tell - but I can really relate to the loss of <br/>
your letterboxing log and stamp.  Steal my car - okay, I can deal <br/>
with that.  Steal all my credit cards - okay, I can deal with that.  <br/>
Steal my car - darned annoyed, but I can deal with that.<br/>
<br/>
STEAL MY LETTERBOXING LOG?<br/>
<br/>
I would immediately equip myself like Lara Croft in Tomb Raider and <br/>
hunt them down and then (okay, this is USENET, so you will have to <br/>
use your imagination as to what I'd do next).<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to send you a little letterboxing "care package", so if you <br/>
email me offline with your real name and address, I can get it out to <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
I come with references, just so that you know that I'm not some <br/>
random letterboxer with a hidden agenda.  You may feel vulnerable <br/>
right now, and I don't want to frighten you by asking for such <br/>
personal information.<br/>
<br/>
I think just about everyone in LBNA can vouch for my character.<br/>
<br/>
And, to ask a question to the group - I think that Wolfmoon is <br/>
entitled to receive The Boo Boo Box for suffering *emotional* injury <br/>
while in the line of letterboxing.  What say you all?<br/>

Oh, the tales I could tell - but I can really relate to the loss of <br/>
your letterboxing log and stamp.  Steal my car - okay, I can deal <br/>
with that.  Steal all my credit cards - okay, I can deal with that.  <br/>
Steal my car - darned annoyed, but I can deal with that.<br/>
<br/>
STEAL MY LETTERBOXING LOG?<br/>
<br/>
I would immediately equip myself like Lara Croft in Tomb Raider and <br/>
hunt them down and then (okay, this is USENET, so you will have to <br/>
use your imagination as to what I'd do next).<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to send you a little letterboxing "care package", so if you <br/>
email me offline with your real name and address, I can get it out to <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
I come with references, just so that you know that I'm not some <br/>
random letterboxer with a hidden agenda.  You may feel vulnerable <br/>
right now, and I don't want to frighten you by asking for such <br/>
personal information.<br/>
<br/>
I think just about everyone in LBNA can vouch for my character.<br/>
<br/>
