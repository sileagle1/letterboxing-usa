This saint was the youngest of 5 girls. She was her papa's little queen. Her<br/>
dog's name was Tom. She entered the convent when she was only 15 and died at<br/>
the age of 24. Do you know who she is?<br/>
<br/>
Clues: To begin this series you need to go into the woods, Woods Park that<br/>
is!!!! Woods Park is at 401 South 33rd Street. There is another entrance on<br/>
O street.<br/>
Park in the lot at the end of the indoor tennis courts. Go to the sidewalk<br/>
between the picnic tables and the lot. Make a left. continue 'til you come<br/>
to the second white dome of the courts. Look to your left and see the lamp<br/>
post at the corner of the dome. Count 3 large evergreens. Make a left and<br/>
walk between the 3rd and the 4th. Walk to a smaller evergreen. The box is<br/>
under wood chips at the tree's base.<br/>
<br/>
Rehide well. Thank you and enjoy. Be sure to put what area you are from when<br/>
you stamp in. The kids are interested to see where visitors are from.<br/>
