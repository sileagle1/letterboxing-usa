<br/>
The Cape Henlopen Devil is a legendary creature that inhabits the <br/>
pine-covered dunes of the piece of land where Delaware Bay meets the <br/>
Atlantic Ocean. The devils are said to be small animals with horns. <br/>
Exactly what kind of animal they are, how many live on the cape, <br/>
whether they really exist, where they came from, and where they have <br/>
disappeared to are the subjects of much speculation. A brochure <br/>
describing an elaborate version of the devils' story is available <br/>
upon request from the Nature Center at Cape Henlopen State Park.<br/>
<br/>
Driving directions:<br/>
Enter Cape Henlopen State Park via Cape Henlopen Drive a little to <br/>
the east of the Cape May-Lewes Ferry docks in Lewes. Follow the <br/>
traffic flow to the admission booths. Admission is $5.00 per out-of-<br/>
state carload and $2.50 per in-state carload during the summer, and <br/>
spring and fall weekends and holidays. Take the first left after the <br/>
booths, and then follow the signs to the Nature Center (one more <br/>
left, then a right, then look for the first building on the left, <br/>
across from the parade field). Park in the lot in front of the Nature <br/>
Center. Park hours are 8am-sunset all year. Nature Center hours are <br/>
somewhat variable; call (302)645-6852 to check hours for the date <br/>
when you are going there.<br/>
