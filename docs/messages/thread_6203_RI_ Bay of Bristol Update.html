<br/>
I just came back from checking up on box #1 of this<br/>
series.  PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL - the "many trunked<br/>
maple" does have a very large, very active bee hive in<br/>
it.  The area is grown up quite a bit, too, and I did<br/>
not bushwhack my way back past the bees to check that<br/>
the box was still there or not.   I was alone, and a<br/>
few "shady characters" along the trail were making me<br/>
anxious to get back to the parking lot ;o).  I would<br/>
recommend going with someone down to this box - there<br/>
were many fire crackers and beer cans - obviously a<br/>
favorite hang out.  There are some bushes growing over<br/>
the trail head, that make it look like it isn't a<br/>
trail.  After pushing past these branches, though, the<br/>
trail is in very good shape.  Not good enough for a<br/>
stroller, but a mountain bike would work (if you are<br/>
fairly experienced).<br/>
<br/>
Jay - if you are out there, this wonderful box really<br/>
should be moved once the bees slow down this winter. <br/>
I would be happy to help out if you like.<br/>
<br/>
As for box #2, I checked in on that a month or so ago<br/>
when it was suspected to have gone missing.  It was<br/>
there and in good shape. To my knowledge it is still<br/>
intact.  There were to many people around to check it<br/>
out today. <br/>
<br/>
Happy 'boxing everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Tig - in beautiful boxing weekend RI ;o)<br/>
