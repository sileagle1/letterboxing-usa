                    <div class="plaintext-content">So where does a hitchiker eventually end up?  Is it eventually mailed <br/>
back to the originator when the journal is completely filled with <br/>
stamps?  Or is the last finder expected to keep it?  Or is it <br/>
expected for the last finder to get it an additional journal to keep <br/>
it on its journey?<br/>

that we'd encounter her again... but over the almost two years that she's been travelling, <br/>
we've had at least 6 email reports that folks have found her. And just got one now saying <br/>
the book is almost full and an offer to send her back to us. This was *very* gratifying and <br/>
my kids are so excited to see where she's been. We will probably make a new book, keep <br/>
the old one, and send her on her way again.<br/>
