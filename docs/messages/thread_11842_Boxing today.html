                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK.... I had a great day out boxing today!  Since I got out of work SO late <br/>
today, I was only able to get three boxes (I was going to try for the Indian <br/>
in the Cupboard, but I also had a meeting tonight, so I wasn't able to make <br/>
it).  I was able to get to the Lily Pad and Sweeney School boxes in <br/>
Willimantic, as well as the Pennsylvania State Stamp in Andover.  Either I'm <br/>
missing something (probably marbles in my head), or those clues are a little <br/>
off.  Anyway, all were doing fine!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting Everyone!<br/>
Music Woman<br/>
(who found her 500th find at PA Stamp today, however, that INCLUDES <br/>
Hitchhikers, and Music Woman doesn't include HH's in her totals..... which <br/>
means only 31 to go until 500!)<br/>
