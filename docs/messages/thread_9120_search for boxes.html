go to:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/lbna/america.htm<br/>
and click on New York...there are 30 boxes in western NY, although I <br/>
don't know how many of those are within a 50 mile radius.<br/>
Happy boxing :)<br/>

This looks so cool, I can't wait to get started still have to get my <br/>
materials together...one thing, if I want to look for boxes in my <br/>
area, how do I go about this? I live in the Buffalo, NY area, and I <br/>
did a search of the archives, and turned up nothing.  Does this mean <br/>
there are no existing boxes?  Does anyone know of any boxes in the <br/>
western NY state area (a radius of about 50 mi. from Buffalo) Or <br/>
will I be a trail blazer? Thanks for any help you can offer!!<br/>

Go to http://www.letterboxing.org/ and click on "CLUES" -- eventually <br/>
you'll end up at the NY state page <br/>
--  http://www.letterboxing.org/ny/ny.htm and you can see the clues in your <br/>
part of the state. The map shows that the county surrounding Buffalo <br/>
has/had at least one box.<br/>
<br/>
If there aren't many in your area, that's your clue to start placing your <br/>
own boxes! The oft-repeated mantra is that "if you place them, they will <br/>
come."<br/>
<br/>
There are a number in NY State further east of Buffalo, so you may wish to <br/>
take a day trip to track down a few of those boxes before you start making <br/>
lots of your own boxes, so that you get a feel for how boxes are hidden and <br/>
clues are created.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome aboard, and good luck!<br/>
