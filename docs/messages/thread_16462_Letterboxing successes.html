great luck this time finding all four letterboxes that we searched <br/>
for and even a hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
Rest and Relaxation letterbox:  Unfortunately not the first (so we <br/>
missed the special surprie) but well worrth the effort anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Lucia Beach Letterbox:  What a beautiful beach.  Great for the kids <br/>
to climb around the rocks awhile.<br/>
<br/>
Owl's Head Light Letterbox:  found it easily and then enjoyed the <br/>
lighthouse and the views for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Lobster Letterbox:  If you are hungry this is the box to look for!  <br/>
Did it in the dark (usually end up that way).  Box needs some minor <br/>
maintenance but other wise in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
Surfin' Santa Hitchhiker:  In great shape.  Found him enjoying the <br/>
Lucia Beach and will take him to new sights soon.<br/>
<br/>
Also made my 20th find this weekend!  Seems like a long way to 100, <br/>
but have no doubt that we will make it there.<br/>
