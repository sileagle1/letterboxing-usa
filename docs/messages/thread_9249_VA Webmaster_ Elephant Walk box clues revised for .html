Elephant Walk Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
This park seems to  have no name and perhaps belongs to the <br/>
Water Authority folks, but you can actually walk from here along <br/>
the river to Riverbend Park. No restrooms, no amenities, lots of <br/>
off-leash dogs most days. From 495, take exit 44 (Rte. 193) west <br/>
toward Great Falls. Go almost to the end, turning right on Seneca <br/>
Rd. just before the traffic light at Route 7. Drive 3.6 miles to the <br/>
end of Seneca Rd., where you will see a yellow barrier (usually <br/>
open) and a cyclone fence-type gate (closed). Park on the road. <br/>
The trail begins just south of the "No bikes on trails" sign that is <br/>
closest to the yellow barrier and gate. WARNING: In the Fall, <br/>
these trails can be VERY hard to see because of all the fallen <br/>
leaves. Take your time! Go 40 paces to a fork just past a fallen <br/>
tree on the left and follow the path that bears nearly due North. <br/>
Stay on this path past where another trail comes in on the right, <br/>
with a "No bikes" sign, and a service road comes in on the left. <br/>
Stay on this now-broadening trail while it turns nearly due East <br/>
and heads downhill. After 10 minutes or so, you will hear the <br/>
river ahead. When the trail flattens out and turns right to follow <br/>
the river, go about 45 paces to a path on the left that leads to the <br/>
river and a nice picnic spot. Enjoy the spot and your lunch. <br/>
Return to the broad path and keep going downstream as the trail <br/>
gradually moves away from the river. After about 25-30 minutes <br/>
total (from your car) you'll come to a place where 2 trails emerge <br/>
on the right. Take the one that bears first about 260 degrees and <br/>
then quickly turns to 270. Follow this path up past the logs <br/>
across the trail, past a large grapevine on the left and then a <br/>
double-trunked tree on the left with, on the right, a tree with very <br/>
pitted bark on the trail side (woodpecker holes?). Stand on the <br/>
trail between these 2 trees. On a bearing of 294 degrees, walk to <br/>
a tree with a bulge at the base. Elephant Walk Letterbox is at the <br/>
base of this tree under a rock, leaves, sticks and a small rotted <br/>
log.<br/>
Difficulty: Aboaut 30 minutes one way, with a short, STEEP uphill <br/>
at one end, and a longish uphill on the return. You will need a <br/>
compass, and you will need to differentiate between a step and <br/>
a pace.<br/>
