                    <div class="plaintext-content">My trail name has been a nickname since my college days.  My email has<br/>
incorporated it for almost a decade.<br/>
<br/>
Someone, many years ago, contacted a rubberstamp company with name<br/>
stamps, wherein a person could request a unique name to be made that<br/>
was not available in the stores.<br/>
<br/>
He had "KuKu" made for me.<br/>
<br/>
When I started LBing in 2003, I had my trail name AND my signature<br/>
stamp ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
It is not handcarved, but it is unique, as it is custom made.<br/>
<br/>
I'll admit, when I finally started meeting letterboxers, I was a<br/>
little nervous.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up chatting with Der Mad Stamper.  When I mentioned my stamp<br/>
was not handcarved (kind of apologetically), he assured me it was<br/>
custom &amp; unique, no problem there.<br/>
<br/>
I personally don't have problems with anyone having storebought stamps<br/>
for their sig stamps.  I know a couple of LBer's who do and think they<br/>
are great!<br/>

We have kind of a mix, since we're new to this and wanted to get<br/>
started NOW!  Our first initials spell out the word "BEAST," so<br/>
I got an alphabet stamp and a paw print. We pulled them off<br/>
their blocks and set them on their own, so it's got the paw<br/>
print with the word BEAST above it.  It was fairly inexpensive,<br/>
simple to do, and yet unique.  I had no idea this was such a hot<br/>
topic!  <br/>
<br/>
Most of the stamps we've found in boxes have been hand carved<br/>
and they're beautiful!  It's always neat to find a stamp that<br/>
reflects something about the placer or the placement.  On the<br/>
other hand, the main reason we do this is because it gets us out<br/>
of the house exploring places we probably wouldn't go otherwise.<br/>
