I doubt we'll get anywhere *near* the Boards and Bridges box, <br/>

The Belmont Caskets are safe and sound, dry and hidden - <br/>

Pico - we made GEKO scramble up for the last one. <br/>

Three in one day! *Looks at watch* And plenty of daylight left!<br/>
Onward!<br/>
<br/>
On to "Quaker Yarn" - Oh my .... Nice hike. *huff-puff*<br/>
And a marvelous view. Tough find - Made easier with Kinz's help, <br/>
seeing as he had stamped it earlier this week. <br/>
Note to self and WebMaster- The initials mentioned in the clue <br/>
on the Beech Tree are "J.B." - NOT "J.E."<br/>
<br/>
Next stop:<br/>
The Monestary Box -<br/>
<br/>
Urp - OK.... After an hour, we surrendered. Beaten. Stampless.<br/>
We didn't understand what a HEPP was, nor an UNTRAIL.<br/>
<br/>
Definition of a LONG WALK ... It's the walk BACK to the car - <br/>
WITHOUT a stamp. *groan*<br/>
<br/>
Anyone find this box recently?<br/>
<br/>
And FORGET Body Parts .... We were BUSHED!<br/>
