Locating the Poindexter Nature Preserve: The preserve is located in Easton Connecticut. It is easily reached by starting from the intersection of CT RT 25 and 59. At this traffic lighted intersection, a third road, Hattertown road, exits to the NW. Take Hattertown road about  mile to a stop sign. Go straight for about  mile and carefully, on a blind right turn, bear left onto Knapp Street. At the end of Knapp Street, about a mile, turn left. About  mile on the left, you will see the wooden railed entrance to PNP. There is a sign at the entrance identifying the entrance. Park carefully. There is a limited number of pull offs along the road for parking. If you feel there is not enough room to park the day you arrive, you might want to consider going to Putnam State Park, which contains multiple letterboxes.<br/>

The Aspetuck Land Trust is a non-profit Connecticut Corporation devoted to preserving open space and the natural resources of Easton, Fairfield, Weston and Westport for the benefit of the public. Pick up a brochure at the entrance of The Poindexter Nature Preserve (PNP) or one of the many other trailed preserves maintained by the Aspetuck Land Trust and consider joining their efforts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Pine Grove<br/>
The pine grove letterbox is located in a large stand of pine. From the entrance of PNP follow the white trail, your only option. Since the PNP is a nature preserve, there are many informative signs placed along the trails identifying natural phenomena, such as watch out for poison ivy. After crossing three stonewalls at some distance into the preserve, you will enter a field. The trail branches in the field, take the left branch to where it rejoins the right branch. Turn left, through the stonewall and stay on the trail as it turns to the right and into the pine grove. The trail meanders through the tall pines, it bears to the right and then at a double stonewall it turns left. When it turns to the left a second time you are near your quest. Before you turn to the left, you will be facing an intersecting stonewall that encompasses the pine grove. Go to the intersecting stonewalls and stand with the large pine tree on you right. In front of you there is a rock in the wall that could be carved into a gravestone. Behind this rock, within the wall, is the pine grove letterbox. Grasp the rock near its top and tilt it towards you to reveal the pine grove letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Please be respectful of these trails, be discrete when finding your box and replace them the way you found them covering them well so others may enjoy the hunt.<br/>
