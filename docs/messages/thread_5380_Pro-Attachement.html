mood...<br/>
<br/>
It might be a little hypocritical of me to be "for" attachements, <br/>
since I can't open the danged things. As webmaster for southern new <br/>
england and some of the west, when clues come in attached, I shut <br/>
down my cranky old Atari-aged computer and go next door to Bob's <br/>
house, give him a beer and apologize for the intrusion, and then log <br/>
on, find the message, download the file, save it to floppy disk, log <br/>
off, gossip a bit, then go home and do the whole fire-up-the-atari-<br/>
and-go thing. So it would REALLY be in my interests if we banned <br/>
attachements.<br/>
<br/>
But I think we should keep 'em.<br/>
<br/>
Now about the blast of attached viruses lately, I don't know. I <br/>
thought yahoogroups would be better at firewalling those out. They're <br/>
not getting through the other half-dozen yahoogroups I visit <br/>
regularly. Strange. Not to sound like a broken record, but I <br/>
recommend choosing the "no email, read on the web only" option. <br/>
