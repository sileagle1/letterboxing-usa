My sons and I use store bought stamps for our personal stamps. We just got all the material to carve our own (at Michael's in fact!) but haven't tried carving our own yet. But we like our store bought stamps! We took a long time to pick them out!  (4 year old + store full of stamps = you do the math!) :)<br/>

  Hi everyone, I was told about Letterboxing by a friend on a camping <br/>

<br/>
Hi Dee, welcome to letterboxing!  Yes, it is addictive!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I've been reading as much as I can find about Letterboxing, and <br/>
from <br/>
&gt; what I see, I live in a virgin county. We hold no letterboxes. I've <br/>
&gt; already thought of about 10 places I put boxes, I just need to get <br/>
my <br/>

Good for you, carving is not as difficult as some people might think.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; hope to run to Micheals craft store in Fredericksburg, VA.  to get <br/>
&gt; the stuff for the stamps. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do have a question though, there are a couple of boxes hidden in <br/>
&gt; Fredericksburg, would it be terribly awful if I bought a couple <br/>
&gt; of "store bought" stamps for the kids (ages 12, 9, and 4) and tried <br/>
&gt; to locate a box or two while we were there. We will carve our own <br/>
(or <br/>
&gt; I should say I'll do the carving) personal stamps, but I don't want <br/>
&gt; to wait another week or so to get started. I have a feeling it's <br/>
&gt; going to take us at long to make our stamps, since we have never <br/>
done <br/>
&gt; this before. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
No problem with using store bought stamps to sign in and later <br/>
changing once you have carved something you like.  Some started with <br/>
store boughts for the same reason -- just wanted to get going, and <br/>
have just continued to use them, even though they carve stamps for <br/>
their boxes.  Another option is to just sign into the log books of <br/>
boxes you find until you have the stamps you want, although I think <br/>
there is an added element of fun, especially for the kids, of <br/>
stamping into the log book instead of just signing your name.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Another question:  I notice on some of the sites, it mentioned <br/>
using <br/>
&gt; pink pearl erasers, are these like those big pink erasers the kids <br/>
&gt; use in school? Do they hold up well? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Yes, these are school erasers.  I find them to be somewhat crumbly.  <br/>
While they are generally not the carving material of choice for most, <br/>
some like them.  Finding a carving material that works for you is <br/>
just one of those things that you need to experiment with.  Probably <br/>
the most popular choices are 'the pink stuff' (Speedball Speedy-<br/>
Stamp), which a 1/4" thick carving material available in the block <br/>
printing section at most larger craft stores, including Michael's;  <br/>
MasterCarve, which is a thicker, softer material available at many <br/>
craft stores and also at some rubber stamping stores;  and PZKut, <br/>
which is a thin material available only online at www.stampeaz.com.  <br/>
In addition to these "sheet/block" materials, you can find suitable <br/>
erasers at most dollar &amp; discount stores and office supply stores.  I <br/>
know the Staples store by us carries 4-pk. Mars Staedler erasers for <br/>
about $2.50.  These carve wonderful, although because of the size, <br/>
you are a bit limited in design choice.  Some of the dollar store <br/>
erasers are great also -- recently Dollar Tree had 10-pk. little <br/>
while erasers for a buck.  Ours are gone, but you may still find some <br/>
where you live.  In general, I find the soft gum erasers the easiest <br/>
for carving.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance for the information!<br/>

Good luck carving and happy hunting!<br/>

Welcome to letterboxing--it's totally bitchin!--oops, there goes my <br/>
Southern California surfing accent, or as we say "ockscent."  As I <br/>
just mentioned in an another post, "We don't need no stinking <br/>
rules."  Letterboxing is not like school, where we had to sit in neat <br/>
little rows and rack our brains trying to figure out whatever it was <br/>
the teacher wanted to hear, rather than thinking.  You can use store <br/>
bought stamps, hand carved stamps, stolen stamps, pieces of string, <br/>
whatever you like, and I'll gladly search for your letterboxes <br/>
(especially if you plant some in Los Angeles).  Well, surf's up; <br/>
someone just planted 5 letterboxes in Beverly Hills, and I'm there at <br/>
dawn this Saturday to be the 1st stamp.  Happy letterboxing!<br/>

I actually purchased a log book today! Could not find any kits or <br/>
supplies or anything to carve my own stamp however and didn't really <br/>
see any "store bought" stamps that I liked. I have designed our own <br/>
custom stamp on one website and I'm considering ordering it this <br/>
weekend. I wanted to get out this morning and just get STARTED <br/>
looking for my first letterbox but we had such a busy schedule <br/>
today, so I just settled for "shopping" for my supplies. However, <br/>
I've also been reading up on "geocaching" and was telling my husband <br/>
that there are actually a LOT of little geocaches right here in our <br/>
little town and several just blocks from our home. So, we went out <br/>
for a bit this evening and tried to find one. We were not very <br/>
successful, which was not really any big surprise since we do not <br/>
have a gps, but my hubby swore he could find the cache without the <br/>
gps...uhuh, yup that worked out really well! He said it was cause it <br/>
was dark out and so now we're planning on going back again tomorrow <br/>
in the daylight to try to find the geocache without a gps.<br/>
Anyway, it was pretty fun, even if we didn't find it and it got us <br/>
out of the house for a bit!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm just getting started on this new "hobby". I am generally <br/>
a "slow <br/>

some <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; posts at first before I get started out "in the field" so to <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; look forward to learning more from all of you about this <br/>
exciting <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; activity of letterboxing and look forward to sharing many <br/>

material it is to make your stamp.  Stamping with your own hand-carved stamp<br/>
and finding hand-carved stamps is much more rewarding than finding<br/>
store-bought stamps, in my opinion.  Even if it's not well-carved, it's<br/>
always nicer to get find a hand-carved stamp than it is a store-bought.<br/>
