<br/>
There are quite a few choices in and around Redmond ( Bellevue and <br/>
Kirkland touch Redmond)<br/>
<br/>
The Redmond Watershed on Novelty Hill Road is a large woodland <br/>
preserve where Mischief has placed the Redmond WSP ( short fairly <br/>
simple) and the Redmond Elementals ( long give 2 hours + <br/>
straightforward clues allow 3  hours for both?)  All boxes contain <br/>
Mischiefs usual fantastic carvings.  Mischief reports that one box , <br/>
the last and most distant) might be missing, unconfirmed.<br/>
<br/>
My "Horsing Around" is right down the road from there.  The clues are <br/>
slightly vexing, nothing careful reading and experience won't solve.  <br/>
venue is small and the time allowed should be only 1 hour.<br/>
<br/>
Both venues feature wonderful PNW woodland.  Trails will be somewhat <br/>
muddy in spots.  (Bridle Trails SP in Kirkland is near and as there <br/>
are horses, not for the folks who like clean outdoor activities, mud <br/>
and apples will be encountered.  Your tidy friend might think you <br/>
crazy)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your visit.  If you want a further afield adventure, check in <br/>
with me and perhaps we can do a further afield adventure.<br/>

She already thinks I'm crazy! Still, I'll try to get her OUT! Thanks so much <br/>

If you're near Redmond/Overlake, I have a couple of easy quick boxes <br/>
on the Bellevue side of the line. Check out Little Bunny (1 mile <br/>
roundtrip, lovely park), and Bad Hat (very sort walk, neat little <br/>
park). Both straightforward, and one of them is harboring a hitchiker.<br/>
<br/>
I also just planted one in Redmond proper, it's a mystery why no <br/>
one's figured it out yet...<br/>
