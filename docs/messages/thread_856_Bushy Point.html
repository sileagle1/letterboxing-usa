Point.  It was fantstic, the last clue was kind of<br/>
diffuclut though, a few compas headdings would have<br/>
been usefull.  Also I am glad that it was not latter<br/>
in the spring or summer as looking around rocks like<br/>
we were could have ended up in a snake bite, ouch. I<br/>
found it very interesting to see how many people<br/>
dropped out after box number four then it seems as<br/>
though another group could not find box number six, or<br/>
gave up after driving to box number five.  For those<br/>
of you who have not completed box five and six it is a<br/>
fun hike, especally if you have not been over to the<br/>
farm.<br/>
I am now at P0F8, I am having fun after being<br/>
introduced to this just about a month and a half ago. <br/>
The X for exchanged, what do you mean, you exchanged<br/>
the custodial up-keep of a particular box?  <br/>
I know where I will place box number one, now I need<br/>
to go out and research it as I have not been to this<br/>
area in about thirteen years.<br/>

the X thing is just a little informal thing we made up after the Fall gathering in VT.  Maybe suconsciously it was a way to create some momentum in our young hobby, or just a way to collect more imprints in our stamp books.  I simply stands for how many personal stamps we have exchnaged with fellow letterboxers.<br/>

<br/>
The "X" makes sense to those who came to the get-together in VT and exchanged <br/>
personal stamp impressions in each other's letterboxing notebooks. That's a very <br/>
small number of letterboxers, however. By and large, it seems to cause a lot of <br/>
confusion, whereas most people immediately understands what "P" and "F" stand <br/>
for.  I am wondering whether we should include the "X" designation on our patch. <br/>
Also wondering why it is "X" and not "E"?  What does everyone think?<br/>
