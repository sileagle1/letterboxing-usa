the yahoo_LBNA talk list such as I have seen for many other groups in<br/>

members towards new people seems to be something I dont care to associate<br/>
with.  There seems to be a feeling amongst some, that people should spend<br/>
many hours learning and researching letterboxing.  I am the mother of two<br/>
boys.  One is epileptic.  I work as a Registered Veterinary Technician, do<br/>
portrait photography, and teach scrapbooking classes, all on the weekends,<br/>
just to try to earn a little extra money for the family.  I also homeschool<br/>
these boys, am Secretary for the Scout Pack and act as taxi driver for the<br/>
activities they are involved in.  The fact that I might have about 1 hour a<br/>
day of down time doesnt seem to matter to those such as phyto.  Do I ask<br/>
for easy answers.  If its truly an important, life-changing or life-saving<br/>
item I need information for, Ill search all night long.  But this is fun?<br/>
Letterboxing is NOT something that will cause the sky to fall.  Should<br/>
people follow the rules.  Certainly, but I witness many people not following<br/>
rules everyday.  Maybe having all the rules and other need to know<br/>
information easily at our fingertips makes life a little easier for those of<br/>
us to dont spend our time putting down those who have just discovered<br/>
something and are excited about learning as quickly as possible, about it.<br/>
I hope you learn what is truly important and put that angry energy into<br/>
discovering the cure for cancer or something like that.  Happy letterboxing.<br/>
Ill tell all the newbies to stay away from this group.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I fail to see how providing a link to the New boxers list is spoonfeeding anything. The New Boxers list was created, sadly, because whenever New Boxers used to land on this list and ask questions, they would get flamed mercilessly by a handful of people. I happen to agree that they should research the hobby to really understand what it's about, but sometimes even after research, things are unclear. So there is a need to ask. Mapsurfer created this list for discussion about letterboxing, but often when a newbie asked a legimate question, it was everybody on the dogpile. So Mark Pepe created the New Boxers list to give them a safe have and to give the veterans a break from seeing the same questions, re-posted every couple of months. And now there is very little discussion here at all. Which is a shame. So you don't want a link to New Boxers because that's spoonfeeding, but you don't want the new boxers to ask the same questions over and over here. What exactly DO you want? No<br/>
 new boxers at all? Well, I wanted to hit the Powerball last night but that ain't happenin' either. So if you don't like the proposed solution to this onging issue, what is yours? <br/>

If one has only one hour a day of down time, then perhaps a time <br/>
consuming hobby like this is not for them, and using that one hour to <br/>
type abrasive notes is angry energy that could be focused on achieving <br/>
whirled peas.<br/>
<br/>
I agree, letterboxing involves searching. I'm not sick of telling folks <br/>
where to find information, because I just don't respond. I empathize, <br/>
Phyto, although there is an abundance of spoons, many have resorted to <br/>
poking them with forks. Although a helpful suggestion, an alphabetized <br/>
index topics wouldn't end the elementary questions either. It's always <br/>
easier to ask for the information or stamp or whatever to be handed to <br/>
you rather than look it up yourself. "How do you spell <br/>
onomatopoeia?" ... "Look it up."<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Mary's angry energy could be focused on her campaign to keep <br/>
newbies away, helping to solve the annoyance of the endless <br/>
introductory questions, and lackadaisical researchers.  <br/>
<br/>
So, Mary, Go for it!<br/>

World. The list is intended for sharing of ideas, stories, tips, <br/>

<br/>
Let's face it, folks. According to those two sentences, newbies <br/>
arriving here can rightfully expect to get tips and advice from the <br/>
experienced letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a newbie, I found out about the New Boxers group because <br/>
of a message posted on this group. Why not add the link to the group <br/>
home page? If someone is new to boxing as well as to Yahoo groups <br/>
like I was they won't know how to find the New Boxers list on their <br/>
own. Why would you bother looking for something that you might not <br/>
expect to exist?<br/>
<br/>
Or you could just add "Abandon all hope, Newbies who enter here!" <br/>
That about covers it as well...<br/>

for easy answers. If its truly an important, life-changing or life-saving<br/>
item I need information for, Ill search all night long. But this is fun?<br/>
Letterboxing is NOT something that will cause the sky to fall. Should<br/>
people follow the rules. Certainly, but I witness many people not following<br/>
rules everyday. Maybe having all the rules and other need to know<br/>
information easily at our fingertips makes life a little easier for those of<br/>
us to dont spend our time putting down those who have just discovered<br/>
something and are excited about learning as quickly as possible, about it.<br/>
I hope you learn what is truly important and put that angry energy into<br/>
discovering the cure for cancer or something like that. Happy letterboxing.<br/>
Ill tell all the newbies to stay away from this group.<br/>

since she's usually pretty level-headed about things, but newbies<br/>
can't take the blame for all the problems on this list. Yahoo Groups<br/>
doesn't make it easy to search these archives. A lot of people who<br/>
begin letterboxing are also newbies to computers and simply don't know<br/>
how to find information on the Internet. They need to be educated<br/>
about how and where to find information.<br/>
<br/>
A certain degree of blame can also be laid at the foot of those who<br/>
run the list. I suggested years ago putting links to splinter groups<br/>
such as the newboxer's group or some of the regional talk lists to<br/>
help people better direct new letterboxers to areas of their interest,<br/>
and the result was a list of links tucked away and hidden in the<br/>
'Links' section which is about as useful to a newbie as a poke in the<br/>
eye. Look at all the junk over there. Database? That feature is so<br/>
poorly designed and lame, there's nothing of real value over there not<br/>
to mention the fact that it's been the root cause of more than one<br/>
flame war. Why the heck is it still enabled after all this time? When<br/>
I created the Pacific Northwest talk list, that was the first thing I<br/>
got rid of. Who uses the calendar? Why is that there? I'd have<br/>
disabled the Files section too on the PNW board, except it'll disable<br/>
the Photos section at the same time which I felt has a real value. The<br/>
members section *could* be useful, but there's so many of them now<br/>
it's incredibly awkward to use and I feel the list is better off<br/>
without it.<br/>
<br/>
Why give people choices they don't need? It confuses them--especially<br/>
those who aren't very computer literate in the first place. I hated<br/>
these Yahoo Groups from the very first day I ever used them, and I<br/>
still hate them. They're poorly designed, can't handle large numbers<br/>
of people well, and are very difficult to use.<br/>
<br/>
Then there's all the other crap Yahoo clutters the screen with. Right<br/>
now, I see a small box says "Hear how Yahoo! Groups has changed the<br/>
lives of others." Really? Who the hell CARES?! I sure don't. Clutter<br/>
that distracts new members from the places with real information.<br/>
There's another message just under that that says, "Yahoo! 360<br/>
degrees: Share your life through photos, blogs, and more." Really? Is<br/>
that what we need here? We can't even get rid of those options, though.<br/>
<br/>
It's almost as if they designed these groups to be as difficult to use<br/>
as possible--seems kind of unfair to knock someone when they can't<br/>
figure out how to use it or pick out the important links from all the<br/>
clutter links. It can be quite overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me that there's a lot to be said for putting the important<br/>
links up from and center to direct attention to them. <br/>

Since when did it require searching just to find an appropriate group<br/>
to post to? Back in the day, it didn't.<br/>

<br/>
Right on!  I'm a newbie to LB, in my own mind, despite being<br/>
sort-of-active for over a year, mainly because I don't go out all that<br/>
often, and *never* just to go letterboxing.  I combine LB with<br/>
geocaching, benchmarking, bird-watching and anything else that happens<br/>
to look like fun.  I belong to the newboxers list, the SoCal list and<br/>
this one, and have found lots of good stuff in all of them.  There is<br/>
no such thing as too much information.  IMHO, if a person feels<br/>
overloaded by data, it's because that person hasn't developed the<br/>
critical skills necessary for culling the useless stuff from the<br/>
useful.  I see nothing wrong with helping all newbies learn "the way<br/>
things are done."  If they ask, that means that they at least have the<br/>
brains to know that they don't understand.  Maybe they *are* lazy, if<br/>
the answer is in a FAQ somewhere.  I still think it is better to<br/>
answer the question, *and* refer them to the info sources, rather than<br/>
just push them to the FAQ and hope for the best.<br/>
<br/>
On a semi-related topic, I very much enjoyed the article on LB in the<br/>
new (November, 2006) issue of Games Magazine.  You and the others<br/>
(Cyclonic, Sewsowbizzy, et al) came off very well, I thought.  I think<br/>
the article was balanced, gave a great sense of what the game is all<br/>
about, didn't give away anything that shouldn't be given away, and had<br/>
some great photos: nice to have some faces to go along with the names<br/>
:-)  Give my regards to Dude!<br/>
<br/>
For the life of me, I cannot see why some people object to articles<br/>
like this.  Sure, some newbies might mess things up.  Well, that's<br/>
Life.  If a person plants a box, they should be willing to maintain<br/>
it: fix it, replace it, remove it, as appropriate, if something<br/>
happens to it.  That's the big difference between geocaching and<br/>
letterboxing: TPtB in geocaching are pushy about hiders keeping their<br/>
hides in good repair, and archiving them if they can't maintain them:<br/>
this is A Good Thing, that pushiness on this issue.  I hate seeing a<br/>
notice on an LB that it was reported missing two years ago!  Why is<br/>
this listing still there?  Why hasn't the owner checked up on it, or<br/>
asked someone local to do so?  Why is *this* sort of bad behavior<br/>
tolerated, but the occasional newbie who rushes in a bit too quickly<br/>
is torn into?  At least if the newbie is active, there is a chance of<br/>
reaching him or her and correcting them; an absent LB owner who hasn't<br/>
checked in in a year might as well be on another planet, for all the<br/>
good s/he is doing to the sport.  Just my thoughts, of course, but I<br/>
definitely fall on the side of those who believe that new boxers are<br/>
necessary, that a little positive "advertising" is not a bad thing,<br/>
that old listings for LBs that are known to be in trouble/gone should<br/>
be removed or be better annotated, and that no one in this hobby knows<br/>
everything.  Keep up the good work, HH :-)<br/>

I, for one, thought Phyto's quick wit was amusing, but I can see another<br/>
side as well.  The first introduction I had to newsgroups and yahoo groups<br/>
was this list almost 3 years ago.  I took the time to read all the<br/>
archives from the beginning of time, because, well, I am an overachiever. <br/>
I couldn't imagine indexing it, but it's not a bad thought (purely for the<br/>
historial value).  Ryan has done a superb job of creating the most<br/>
user-friendly website for hobbyists.  I daresay the features have made<br/>
many a user less fearful of technology.<br/>
<br/>
What I love about letterboxing is that we have options.  If we stay put<br/>
and do not change we will die a miserable death.  Celebrate diversity.<br/>

Exactly how I feel. I too fall on the side of those who feel it's<br/>
important to encourage new boxers, promote the game in a positive<br/>
manner, and keep a clean database - retire*/adopt boxes of absentee<br/>
owners (AQ does this). <br/>
<br/>
*I'm in favor of retiring boxes rather than deleting them. That way<br/>
they are still on the site for posterity and for those of us who like<br/>
to keep an electronic record of our finds - sometimes it's nice to go<br/>
back and re-read the clues and live the experience vicariously.<br/>

&gt; Im going to remove myself from this group, as the attitude of some<br/>
of the<br/>

associate<br/>
&gt; with.  There seems to be a feeling amongst some, that people should<br/>
spend<br/>
&gt; many hours learning and researching letterboxing.  I am the mother<br/>
of two<br/>
&gt; boys.  One is epileptic.  I work as a Registered Veterinary<br/>
Technician, do<br/>
&gt; portrait photography, and teach scrapbooking classes, all on the<br/>
weekends,<br/>
&gt; just to try to earn a little extra money for the family.  I also<br/>
homeschool<br/>
&gt; these boys, am Secretary for the Scout Pack and act as taxi driver<br/>
for the<br/>
&gt; activities they are involved in.  The fact that I might have about 1<br/>
hour a<br/>
&gt; day of down time doesnt seem to matter to those such as phyto.  Do<br/>
I ask<br/>
&gt; for easy answers.  If its truly an important, life-changing or<br/>
life-saving<br/>
&gt; item I need information for, Ill search all night long.  But this<br/>
is fun?<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing is NOT something that will cause the sky to fall.  Should<br/>
&gt; people follow the rules.  Certainly, but I witness many people not<br/>
following<br/>
&gt; rules everyday.  Maybe having all the rules and other need to know<br/>
&gt; information easily at our fingertips makes life a little easier for<br/>
those of<br/>
&gt; us to dont spend our time putting down those who have just discovered<br/>
&gt; something and are excited about learning as quickly as possible,<br/>
about it.<br/>
&gt; I hope you learn what is truly important and put that angry energy into<br/>
&gt; discovering the cure for cancer or something like that.  Happy<br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; Ill tell all the newbies to stay away from this group.<br/>

letterboxing--you don't even need clues to find boxes. Just start<br/>
looking around. You can get buckets full of stamps in the pubs. Is<br/>
that the real spirit of letterboxing?<br/>
<br/>
The spirit of the game--I think--is to have fun and enjoy yourself. If<br/>
someone can do that by getting large quantities of drive-by<br/>
letterboxes, good for them. If someone else gets their kicks from long<br/>
hikes or strenuous mental puzzles, good for them. If someone else<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">THANK YOU RYAN! All this talk about "spirit" and "tradition" when we don't even play the game in the US that way it is in it's birthplace of Dartmoor. Someone once posted something like "I don't understand why a handful of people insist on bucking tradition and doing things their own way" or something. To which I say "Hooray! Thank you Mapsurfer, and Tom Cooch and Dan Servatius (sp) and Erik and Susan Davis, et all. Thank you so much that when you found out about this hobby, you did not set it up exactly like it was in England. You were independent, creative thinkers who decided not to make everyone scrabble around under rocks and plants for thier first 100 boxes, thank you for setting up the website (hugely controversial with the Brits, who flamed the hell out of our founders over it) thank you, thank you, thank you." <br/>

  Of course the post wasn't about them, but I had difficulty applying the post to the US and "tradition" when boxing has been around for over 150 years or so in England and 8 or 9 years in the US. And the US version bears little resemblance.<br/>
<br/>
  I suggest everyone view the film of the first gathering which is on Mark Pepe's website. If you aren't in it, you are a newbie yourself, not one of the founding members. Listen to their hopes for the future of this hobby in the US. Read the early emails of how much they dreamed of a time when Letterboxing was a vibrant hobby all over the US. Isosceles did a great job a couple of years ago of mapping out the early beginnings of Letterboxing and pulling together the early posts. I contacted him a few months ago and asked him if he would do it again as the links weren't working anymore. I just loved it and found myself more in awe than ever of the handful of founders of this hobby in the US. He said he would when he had a chance. If he starts posting those again I hope everyone will read them. But watch the movie on Pepe's sight, then take a big healthy does of "get over youself" and be grateful the those independant few who said "Let's do it our way". Listen to thier<br/>
 thoughts on how they wanted the hobby to evolve and think about what you are doing to carry on their hopes and dreams for everyone who came after them. <br/>
<br/>
  Is there a saturation point? Probably, who knows, but somehow England has survived and they've been doing it a hell of a lot longer then we have. <br/>

<br/>
  &gt; Personally I don't see how a person making all of their clues WOM<br/>
  &gt; or alternately distributed constitutes an attitude such as you<br/>
  &gt; presume.<br/>
<br/>
  Taking *all* of her clues offline suggests she doesn't like the way<br/>
  the game is played. I don't mind WOM or alternately distributed<br/>
  clues--I've even toyed around with the idea of a Dartmoor-style<br/>
  cluebook myself. It really doesn't bother me at all--I'm okay with that.<br/>
<br/>
  But I am bothered by the fact it seems hypocritical to complain about<br/>
  "letterboxing just isn't for you" if they don't like how it is played<br/>
  when she's a perfect example of not liking how the game is played. I<br/>
  applaud her for trying to make the game more to her ideal--I much<br/>
  prefer someone taking action and doing something about a problem than<br/>
  just complaining about it and doing nothing--but I think it's<br/>
  disgraceful for her to criticize others for doing the same thing and<br/>
  telling them to get lost if they don't like how letterboxing is<br/>
  played. By her own rules, she should have already quit.<br/>
<br/>
  Since when did letterboxing become about hiding the rules on how to<br/>
  play? Why complain that people don't follow rules if you aren't<br/>
  willing to hand them a rule sheet in the first place? Why the heck<br/>
  would you NOT want new letterboxers to find their way to the newboxers<br/>
  list?<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; I actually think it is quite creative and clever -- certainly more<br/>
  &gt; in the spirit of the game of letterboxing than reducing yourself to<br/>
  &gt; the lowest common denominator and spoon-feeding insipid drive-by<br/>
  &gt; boxes to the masses.<br/>
<br/>
  While I'm no big fan of drive-by boxes myself, who's to say what "the<br/>
  spirit" of letterboxing should be? On Dartmoor--the birthplace of<br/>
  letterboxing--you don't even need clues to find boxes. Just start<br/>
  looking around. You can get buckets full of stamps in the pubs. Is<br/>
  that the real spirit of letterboxing?<br/>
<br/>
  The spirit of the game--I think--is to have fun and enjoy yourself. If<br/>
  someone can do that by getting large quantities of drive-by<br/>
  letterboxes, good for them. If someone else gets their kicks from long<br/>
  hikes or strenuous mental puzzles, good for them. If someone else<br/>
  prefers "finding" virtual boxes or waiting for them to show up in<br/>
  their mailbox--good for them. At least they're enjoying themselves.<br/>
  Why should I care if someone else likes to play the game differently<br/>
  than I do? <br/>
<br/>
  I'm glad Phyto has decided to play the game to her liking--but it's<br/>
  just wrong to diss someone else because they don't want to play her<br/>
  version of the game.<br/>

  Its not ok to judge anyone for there beliefs,The saying different strokes for different folks .After almost a 1000 boxes and 1 year of boxing .I still feel like a newbbie .We do research for the mystery's ,and we file them in with the regular boxes.I prefer a longer hike and a beautiful spot as oppose to a drive by box.Yes i love wonderful carves, but the person who carves that is not a graphic designer is also a wonderful carver ,cause they cared to try .One box took me to a place i grew up in and didn't know it was there .How cool is that !But we all did start as a newbbie . With all the articles on tv,newspapers,and many other places the sport is bound to grow.But the judgment works both ways .The facts are there are wom boxes and reg boxes .I am sure there are plenty for all to find. <br/>

  So basically it is okay for you to criticize Phyto about the way that she has chosen to play the game, but it is not okay for her to voice opinions about the way that others have chosen to play the game.<br/>
<br/>
  Okay, I get it.<br/>

<br/>
  &gt; Personally I don't see how a person making all of their clues WOM<br/>
  &gt; or alternately distributed constitutes an attitude such as you<br/>
  &gt; presume.<br/>
<br/>
  Taking *all* of her clues offline suggests she doesn't like the way<br/>
  the game is played. I don't mind WOM or alternately distributed<br/>
  clues--I've even toyed around with the idea of a Dartmoor-style<br/>
  cluebook myself. It really doesn't bother me at all--I'm okay with that.<br/>
<br/>
  But I am bothered by the fact it seems hypocritical to complain about<br/>
  "letterboxing just isn't for you" if they don't like how it is played<br/>
  when she's a perfect example of not liking how the game is played. I<br/>
  applaud her for trying to make the game more to her ideal--I much<br/>
  prefer someone taking action and doing something about a problem than<br/>
  just complaining about it and doing nothing--but I think it's<br/>
  disgraceful for her to criticize others for doing the same thing and<br/>
  telling them to get lost if they don't like how letterboxing is<br/>
  played. By her own rules, she should have already quit.<br/>
<br/>
  Since when did letterboxing become about hiding the rules on how to<br/>
  play? Why complain that people don't follow rules if you aren't<br/>
  willing to hand them a rule sheet in the first place? Why the heck<br/>
  would you NOT want new letterboxers to find their way to the newboxers<br/>
  list?<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; I actually think it is quite creative and clever -- certainly more<br/>
  &gt; in the spirit of the game of letterboxing than reducing yourself to<br/>
  &gt; the lowest common denominator and spoon-feeding insipid drive-by<br/>
  &gt; boxes to the masses.<br/>
<br/>
  While I'm no big fan of drive-by boxes myself, who's to say what "the<br/>
  spirit" of letterboxing should be? On Dartmoor--the birthplace of<br/>
  letterboxing--you don't even need clues to find boxes. Just start<br/>
  looking around. You can get buckets full of stamps in the pubs. Is<br/>
  that the real spirit of letterboxing?<br/>
<br/>
  The spirit of the game--I think--is to have fun and enjoy yourself. If<br/>
  someone can do that by getting large quantities of drive-by<br/>
  letterboxes, good for them. If someone else gets their kicks from long<br/>
  hikes or strenuous mental puzzles, good for them. If someone else<br/>
  prefers "finding" virtual boxes or waiting for them to show up in<br/>
  their mailbox--good for them. At least they're enjoying themselves.<br/>
  Why should I care if someone else likes to play the game differently<br/>
  than I do? <br/>
<br/>
  I'm glad Phyto has decided to play the game to her liking--but it's<br/>
  just wrong to diss someone else because they don't want to play her<br/>
  version of the game.<br/>

See the 'Links' listing on the left of the Home page. Under Regional <br/>
Talk Lists the Newboxers list is right at the top. I believe with <br/>
the addition Choi made to the 'Getting Started" page there is <br/>
sufficient notice.<br/>
 There has been some heated discussion regarding "spoon feeding" of <br/>
new folks and I tend to like the idea that new folks get directed to <br/>
a new boxers list, BUT newboxers should get the idea that searching <br/>
is part of the letterboxing idea. Many times cruising through links <br/>
and files, yes and even 'flames' can lead you to a hidden clue to a <br/>
letterbox. So if the new folks get all of their questions answered <br/>
without a search then they can be missing part of the quest.<br/>
<br/>
Now a bit off subject and not in response to Lone R's post but <br/>
surely a part of this or any other list where you have discussions, <br/>
can SOME of you have discussions and give and take without calling <br/>
names? Once you attack the person rather than the argument it tends <br/>
to make your argument look childish and then the flames erupt. If <br/>
you have to resort in name calling then maybe you shouldn't hit <br/>
the 'send' button, but instead wait a bit. Now I suppose those that <br/>
I'm directing this to will immediately think I have just called <br/>
them 'childish', well please reread "it tends to make your argument <br/>
look childish". That is far different than calling <br/>
someone 'childish'.<br/>

I sure hope so, although I'm sure the letterboxing snobs who have their <br/>

I'm glad to see that most people are reasonable and realize that <br/>
newbies should be given guidance when they ask for it.  I am still <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Everyone has their own preferences as to types of boxes they prefer and how they define boxes. And even that is not to say that we have not all gone outside of our *preferred* type of box now and then, both in planting and in seeking.  In particular I think that while traveling, we often tend to seek out shorter hikes and drive-by boxes due to time constraints, especially if there are not a lot of boxes in an area.<br/>
<br/>
It is my personal feeling that the ideal letterbox provides something worthwhile, something unique -- other than just another stamp image. This may be challenging clues, an awesome hike, an interesting piece of history, a great location, an extremely creative theme, a skillfully carved stamp or even a creatively crafted logbook. While my personal ideal box would offer many of these, not every box is going to, nor should it have to.<br/>
<br/>
I don't necessarily have a problem with a drive-by box just because it is a drive-by box -- what is the definition of a *drive-by* box anyway? There are certainly a good number of people for whom letterboxing would not be possible were it not for these types of boxes, due to physical limitations, etc. That being said, I would expect to receive something else of value from a drive-by box -- a great location, view, an interesting historical tidbit, fun clues, etc. (and again this is very subjective -- what is of value to one person may not be the same as for the next). I have done many letterboxes that perhaps took only 5-10 minutes once I got out of my car that I would not even necessarily consider *drive-by* letterboxes, particularly if I worked for several weeks on the clues and/or followed driving directions, etc. But these generally all offered something above and beyond.<br/>
<br/>
My comment of *insipid drive-by boxes* was not a reference to all drive-by boxes, rather to those that have been placed simply for the sake of placing a letterbox and offer very little other than a stamp for the logbook. As I said this is all quite subjective, but I think we have all done the letterbox on the edge of the parking lot that had no challenge, no particularly creative theme or box contents, no view, no historical significance.<br/>
<br/>
In regards to the *Along the Way* box in particular...  This box was placed while on vacation in a scenic area which was completely devoid of letterboxes at the time.  I had no intention of placing a letterbox at that location, rather was just meandering through DE, taking side roads, enjoying the journey, and was so struck by the tranquility of the area that I sat for about 30 minutes to put together a box to share the place with other letterboxers. Judging from the comments in the logbook, the location/box was enjoyed by many people during the time it was in place -- several people commented that even though they lived only a short distance away, they had no idea this place even existed. For anyone to single out that one particular box for the sake of argument is stepping completely outside of context and showing their own unfamiliarity with the letterboxes I haved placed.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Two quick thoughts ...<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think for sure that the Newbies group link should be <br/>
&gt; &gt;right at the top of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the group's main page.<br/>
&gt; &gt; AND I think it should also be popped into the <br/>
&gt; &gt;letterboxing.org site, to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; found as easily as the link to this group is found. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Really I think people<br/>

&gt; The spirit of the game--I think--is to have fun and enjoy yourself. <br/>
&gt; If someone can do that by getting large quantities of drive-by<br/>
&gt; letterboxes, good for them....<snip><br/>
<br/>
Where's Mark to add the onion comment to this emerging thought? It is<br/>
an eloquent example of how the game is currently played. With each new<br/>
discovery about letterboxing that emerges, another fold of the "onion"<br/>
(if you will) opens up to someone and they find something else that<br/>
may catch their interest, whether it turns them onto carving stamps,<br/>
or perhaps re-connecting to their local land trust system, or even to<br/>
a historical society in their community. There are many facets of this<br/>
hobby that truly make letterboxing a gem in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I'm glad Phyto has decided to play the game to that liking--but it's<br/>
&gt; just wrong to diss someone else because they don't want to play that<br/>
&gt; version of the game.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that it offers something for everyone (as this has been<br/>
rehashed many times) but that it is often the discovery of the secret<br/>
avenues in which you obtain these clues or connections that is often<br/>
the most rewarding aspect to letterboxing. Not knowing exactly where<br/>
to go, not having the exact location, not knowing every little detail<br/>
about a clue. Perhaps it is just "my way" in feeling comfortable with<br/>
minimal information and enjoying the thrill of discovery in peeling<br/>
back another layer, but it seems to me from the few years that we've<br/>
been involved, that both Isosceles and I have met many folks along the<br/>
way that also enjoy this element of letterboxing as well, so I do not<br/>
believe it is "just my liking".<br/>
<br/>
"Diss"? - not in my dictionary nor my current vocabulary to<br/>
DIS-respect someone else, merely pointing out the fact that you don't<br/>
have to play it that way, and you can simply ignore what you don't<br/>
like. Most often things in an online fashion are misconstrued from<br/>
what the author's original intention in the post may have been. That<br/>
is truly unfortunate and one of the more complelling reasons (of many)<br/>
why I choose to conduct the majority of my letterboxing socializing in<br/>
person or offline.  It would be unfortunate if someone based an<br/>
opinion on another exclusively from a chat list. If I remember<br/>
correctly, Ryan authored some excellent descriptions of ways in which<br/>
to approach letterboxing (pre-AQ) that really nailed the concept of a<br/>
box having an "audience". Perhaps you could extrude those from the<br/>
archives.<br/>
<br/>
It's all there, you just have to look.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, Don!  I think your words need to be reread by everyone <br/>
involved in this thread.   Can not a discussion be held without <br/>
calling people names or getting panties bunched in wads?  Are we not <br/>
thinking adults?<br/>
<br/>
Newbies, relative newbies, you are just as guilty of this as <br/>
silverbacks.  When something is said, read it, digest it and see if <br/>
there is anything of value to gain from it instead of your first <br/>
reaction being to call people snobs, elitists, etc, or to assume it <br/>
means that people don't want you playing with their ball.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone starting something new needs to learn about it from someone <br/>
else unless they themselves created it.  The best at the game learn <br/>
from a number of different players with different styles and don't <br/>
get their information from one source/person/list only.  <br/>
<br/>
Just because someone professes to be educating the masses doesn't <br/>
mean they have the "best way" of doing things.  Be careful consumers <br/>
of information.  Much has been lost with some very awesome players <br/>
who have gotten tired of such BS and moved on to other hobbies that <br/>
cause less grief due to things such as this latest flame and others <br/>
like it. Those in the hobby the longest probably rue with me the loss <br/>
of the mapsurfers, the legerdemaines, the tomcooches, the davises, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
Every game is played with variations and nuances.  Just because <br/>
person A tells you something- that high PFX counts are the goal, or <br/>
that you do things anyway you please, who cares what others think?--<br/>
that doesn't necessarily mean that that is all there is to the game <br/>
you are playing.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps person B, person C, person D and person E will respectively <br/>
tell you that writing clever clues, or carving a neat stamp, solving <br/>
mysteries  or great hikes with great friends are the goals.  Who is <br/>
wrong?<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing wrong with taking all opinions, sorting them out, <br/>
finding the ones that make most sense to you, melding a few together <br/>
and playing it the way you'd like to play (within certain limits that <br/>
keep the game letterboxing and not something else, like geocaching or <br/>
questing, of course). <br/>
<br/>
But above all, if you call people names, you cannot and shouldn't be <br/>
taken seriously.  Disrespect will get you no where, realizing that <br/>
everyone has an opinion and not taking it personally (because, <br/>
afterall, it really isn't *all about you, all the time* anyway) will <br/>
help you to become the best player you can be.  <br/>
<br/>
And if you aren't in something to become the best you can be and <br/>
improving things for everyone, old and new, why be involved at all?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Remember, without the other people playing this game  you have <br/>
nothing to find. We've lost too much already.<br/>

&gt; Now a bit off subject and not in response to Lone R's post but <br/>
&gt; surely a part of this or any other list where you have discussions, <br/>
&gt; can SOME of you have discussions and give and take without calling <br/>
&gt; names? Once you attack the person rather than the argument it tends <br/>
&gt; to make your argument look childish and then the flames erupt. If <br/>
&gt; you have to resort in name calling then maybe you shouldn't hit <br/>
&gt; the 'send' button, but instead wait a bit. Now I suppose those that <br/>
&gt; I'm directing this to will immediately think I have just called <br/>
&gt; them 'childish', well please reread "it tends to make your argument <br/>
&gt; look childish". That is far different than calling <br/>
&gt; someone 'childish'.<br/>
