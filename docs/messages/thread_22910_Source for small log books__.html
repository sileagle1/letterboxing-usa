                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Friends,<br/>
<br/>
I'm wondering if anyone knows of a source of small BLANK notebooks for <br/>
letterboxing?<br/>
<br/>
The size I'm wanting is 3 inches by 4-1/2 inches. (Or smaller.)  This <br/>
size fits in my boxes well.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also hoping to find them with fairly thick pages... as the usual <br/>
smallish notebooks I've seen around have such super-thin pages that ink <br/>
bleeds through too easily.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there isn't such a thing??? I'm beginning to think this is true <br/>
-- as I've searched and searched the internet with no luck for books <br/>
this size.<br/>
<br/>
I've been making my own -- and I know for some, this is part of the <br/>
fun/art of letterboxing. But for me this is not fun; only tedious and <br/>
time consuming... taking my time away from the carving of the stamps <br/>
and clue making; parts of L'bxing that I like best.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions???<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>

<br/>
I love the little Museum books and used them exclusively when I <br/>
started boxing, but it got to be too expensive for me to continue <br/>
using them once I started planting a LOT. So now I buy books from the <br/>
dollar store, Walmart's craft section, or I make my own with heavier <br/>
paper (easier than you think). <br/>
<br/>
If your heart is still stuck on the Masters Museum books, check a <br/>
fine art store in a college town. Our art store carries these as well <br/>
as two others that size..one with a spiral...one with an asian <br/>
pattern on it. They are priced around $3...about the same you are <br/>
paying by buying online with shipping.  I have also seen the Masters <br/>
Musuem books at times in my local A.C. Moore Arts and Crafts store.<br/>
<br/>
Believe it or not....I have found two of my Master's Museum logbooks <br/>
missing when I went to check on my letterboxes. Everything else was <br/>
intact, but the logbooks were gone. I believe they were just too <br/>
pretty to resist for a muggle or rogue letterboxer. Either that or <br/>
the squirrels in that area have very discriminating artistic taste.<br/>

thing...hard to find, much of the year.<br/>
<br/>
I do, however, find my local high quality art supply store carries <br/>
them, but ONLY (apparently) just when each semester starts.  Wish I'd <br/>
bought even more than I did in September.  Danged art students!<br/>
<br/>
This one is slightly bigger than your stated dimensions.... (3X5"), <br/>
but can be cut down.  It's 50 pound stock and, most importantly, acid <br/>
free!  Going rate in Denver is less than $3, and very readily found, <br/>
even at Michaels....so much so that a LOT of ppl use them!  It's <br/>
called Esquisse (aka Canson).  Unlike the Masters Museum books, <br/>
however, it's spiral bound, but more pages.<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps.<br/>
