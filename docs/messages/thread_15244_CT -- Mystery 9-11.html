                    <div class="plaintext-content">In over forty years, I don't think she had ever turned right.  That's what <br/>
Mom said as she accompanied us to her second ever letterbox.  A right turn <br/>
off the thruway and we were into new territory.  Pretty soon Mom would be <br/>
heard to say that she would never go that way again -- but, that comes a <br/>
little later...<br/>
<br/>
We were on a letterboxing roll -- that's right -- we had found the last one <br/>
we sought with little or no difficulty!  Of course, it was basically hidden <br/>
in plain sight in the stamping store, but -- I say it counts just the same <br/>
and I was proud!<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit that the blackout the day before had brought back some of <br/>
the uncertainty and anxiety of 9-11.  And so it was appropriate that we <br/>
venture to see the new monument paying respect to those lost during those <br/>
tragic days.  Having been raised in the NY area and now living in the DC <br/>
suburbs, both Da and I were greatly affected by the events almost two years <br/>
ago.<br/>
<br/>
The monument is very simple as you stand overlooking the water.  The box was <br/>
hidden just as stated and we really liked the markers included.  The stamp <br/>
was simple, yet profound and suited the site perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
So, why wouldn't Mom ever return?  It had nothing to do with the monument <br/>
itself, nor the cause behind it.  Her strong feelings of distaste and <br/>
disgruntlement stemmed from --  the parking fee.  Seven bucks to park -- and <br/>
that's only because she leaned way over Da and waved at the attendant with <br/>
her CT driver's license -- he was about to charge us $10 for our <br/>
out-of-state plates!  Mom was pissed off, being that her tax dollars are <br/>
going to support the area and all.  Now, don't get me wrong -- Mom is <br/>
generous to a fault!  You should just witness the piles of treasure she had <br/>
gotten for the kids at each gift shop we visited.  We walked around, <br/>
admiring the view and then headed back to "the lot."<br/>
<br/>
As we drove back through the intersection heading toward home, I thought $7 <br/>
wasn't too high a price to pay for seeing what lies down a road never taken <br/>
and, I am awfully glad that my family, unlike so many in the NY, DC and PA <br/>
areas, were able to be together that day to complain about it.  BeMa<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Music Woman!  This was a really crazy trip.  We kept shuttling back in <br/>
forth between my folks and my in-laws depending on how my dad was feeling.  <br/>
All our plans were very up in the air and would even change while we were on <br/>
the road going someplace!<br/>
<br/>
We would love to meet some CT boxers.  Be and Ma are like crazed rock stars <br/>
now, over anxious to sign their name on anything that even remotely <br/>
resembles a log book!!<br/>
<br/>
As the parents are getting older and their health is becoming a little more <br/>
fragile, Da and I will probably be making more trips up North.  I will try <br/>
and give you a head's up the next time we will be in the area.<br/>
<br/>
I know you make it down toward DC too.  So, let us know if you plan a trip <br/>
our way.  BeMa<br/>
