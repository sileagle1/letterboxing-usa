Summer finally decided to show up! Taking advantage of<br/>
the wonderful weather the last few days, we took a<br/>
break from planting to go hunting!<br/>
<br/>
Stratton Brook Spur Trail: Another nice box from the<br/>
Hike it or Bike it guys. <br/>
<br/>
Avon: The directions to the trail head are written<br/>
like you are coming from Rt. 10, but the landmarks are<br/>
written as if you're coming from the opposite<br/>
direction. Once we got that sorted out, we had fun on<br/>
the trail and found our quarry. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Spring Has Sprung: The huge trees were really cool.<br/>
The unbelievable amount of bugs was not!<br/>
<br/>
Runaway Soccer Ball: Took a bit, but we found it. The<br/>
bike trails back there are numerous and somewhat<br/>
confusing. <br/>
<br/>
East Vile Nirus: It's fun to be first!!<br/>
<br/>
And, after all of the finding and planting of the last<br/>
few days, we have broken the PFX 200 barrier! On to<br/>
500!<br/>

We count "V"irtual boxes seperately, since they aren't<br/>
in any of our logbooks. It's not a common counting<br/>
convention, but we're not conventional people. :-)<br/>
