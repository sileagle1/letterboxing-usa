So I know this is WAY in advance warning, and it's not even (yet) a<br/>
strictly-speaking letterboxing event...but I thought you might be<br/>
interested, and with a enough warning, maybe those of you from <br/>
further afield than the Colorado's Front Range might be able to make <br/>
plans to attend -'cause it IS an exploring event, just like boxing!<br/>
<br/>
The second annual Doors Open Denver dates for 2006 dates have just <br/>
beenannounced.<br/>
<br/>
Second annual Doors Open Denver<br/>
April 22 - 23, 2006<br/>
http://www.denvergov.org/doorsopendenver/<br/>
<br/>
I went to the first one last year. Only planned on one day, but ended<br/>
up going back on Sunday for more.<br/>
<br/>
Highlights for me included - going UNDER the stage at the Paramount<br/>
Theatre with volunteers who play the organs there (only one of 2<br/>
theatres like it in the entire country), a tour of the Presidential<br/>
Suite at the Brown Palace Hotel, the Miniature Railway Museum in the <br/>
basement of Union Station (usually opened only about one day a <br/>
month), the Governors Mansion was open for the day (it has very <br/>
limited hours for tours), downtown/LoDo lofts...including some <br/>
private residences with bazillion dollar views, Capitol Hill <br/>
Mansions almost never open to the public, a guided tour of the <br/>
Denver Press Club with working journalist, and so on. My friend and <br/>
I barely scratched the surface of the 80+buildings which were open <br/>
for the weekend...even in two days!<br/>
<br/>
You never know - there just might be some letterboxes placed in time<br/>
for the event, or perhaps a meet could be organized!<br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned on the link above for when the map/guide of which <br/>
locations will be participating this year comes out, and on this <br/>
list (Rocky Mountain talk list with title of same name as this one <br/>
on LbNA will most likely more info than here) for boxing-specific <br/>
info as the dates draw closer.<br/>
<br/>
