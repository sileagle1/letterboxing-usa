                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I'm relatively new to letterboxing, with a status of P1 F7.  I had <br/>
some wonderful first experiences letterboxing over the weekend, the <br/>
best one being going letterboxing with my parents in one of our <br/>
favorite spots in Los Angeles (Descando Gardens) and watching my Dad <br/>
get really excited on the hunt.  It's not everyday when you can show <br/>
the old man something new ("It's very british," he said!).<br/>
<br/>
I am a painter and I live in Las Vegas, Nevada.  You can find out <br/>
more about me and some of what I do (zines, etc...) at:<br/>
<br/>
http://home.earthlink.net/~fundraiserx.<br/>
<br/>
One question I have has to do with I guess my obsession with having <br/>
a "medicine bag" of sorts for letterboxing.  I'd like some kind of <br/>
bag that would hold my 5.5" x 8.5" journal, my personal stamp, ink <br/>
pads, pen and wiping rag (I discovered how wet and messy letterboxing <br/>
can get when you're trying to manage their stamp-your stamp-your pad-<br/>
and book all at once.) It would be cool if there was a little plastic <br/>
window that I could slip a picture of my personal stamp into.  I'm <br/>
not exactly the world's best seamstress, but wondered if any of you <br/>
had found something like this that would work or if (?) someone is <br/>
handy and might want to consider making one for trade or purchase.<br/>
<br/>
That's all for now.  Glad to have found this group.<br/>

I keep my stamps and stamp pads in one zipper pocket, my compass and flashlight in another, extra ziplock bags in one and ball point pens in the little elastic holders. I sprayed the outside with scotch guard after I painted my picture on it and it has worked beautifully on the 4 trips I've made with it.

I use a Fanny Pack, but my logbook is smaller than yours so <br/>
not sure if it would work for you.  I put logbook, ink, and<br/>
stamp all in separate zip lock bags, plus I have another <br/>
pocket for basic first aid and small flashlight.  It also<br/>
has two water bottles for those longer letterbox hikes.  <br/>
Instead of having my personal stamp in view, I sewed the<br/>
LBNA patch on the front of the pack in case somebody<br/>
on the trail is a Letterboxer and wants to Exchange.<br/>
What might be best for you is a Camel Bak (or other brand)<br/>
hydration pack with big pockets.  Hope this helps and<br/>
welcome to this group!<br/>
