To me, it is absolutely pointless to rely on an outer bag for protection;<br/>
you might as well leave the box open to the elements.<br/>

&gt; I have been boxing for a few years and DO put bags on the outside of my boxes. I carry extra bags with me in case I find a box full of water. After I dry it the best I can, I put everything back and put a bag on the outside. It is my experience that, as long as it is closed by the finder, it keeps water out. Furthermore, I don't think this is a topic for debate. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. If I choose to use an extra bag and I don't, so what. It does not change the big picture of LB'ing. <br/>

&gt; OK people, I know this has been discusses several times in the past and on several boards but I just have to vent......<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; What is the rationale for using plastic bags OUTSIDE of boxes?  They serve no useful purpose; they get dirty and torn; they do not provide any extra protection.<br/>
<br/>
NO USEFUL PURPOSE!!!!! Contrary to this statement it is obvious that they do serve a useful purpose. Think of them as a test. Once holes get in the bags (that could be as soon as 5 minutes after the last finder wrapped the baggy around the box) Then the seal of the box gets the test. The baggie will keep moisture all around the box so then the seal of the box (be it a crummy box or a lock&amp;lock) will be tested to make sure it stays water tight.Once the seal is bypassed then the quality of the interior baggies get tested.<br/>
<br/>
Please when finding another person's plant do not place a baggie on the exterior. If you want to use baggies on your exterior (your letterbox not you personally) then that is your business.<br/>

I think you are being unnecessarily restrictive - if they want to apply<br/>
baggies to their personal exterior, I don't think we should limit them<br/>
there.  Just hopefully they will camo them first so they aren't see-through.<br/>

Furthermore, I don't think this is a topic for debate. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I planted my first box, I wanted to do something special, so I painted a design on the outside of my plastic container with acrylic paint. I didn't expect the paint job to last very long, but it was fun doing it.  I tested the container to make sure it was water tight - weighted it down submerged in water for several days with some paper inside.  The paper stayed dry.  So, I planted it naked with my logbook and stamp inside and it stayed dry.  The container got a bit scratched up, but nothing major.  So one day I thought maybe if I put a baggie around the container it wouldn't get quite as scratched up.  I had read that it wasn't a good thing to put a bag on the outside and the reasons, but thought I'd try it anyway.  BAD MOVE!  After a week I checked on the box, and there was condensation in the bag and the paint was peeling off the container in places. The inside of the container was still nice and dry, just as it had been before.  So, I left the<br/>
 bag off.  In the meantime, I had heeded the wisdom of those more experience than I had and planted several other boxes without bags outside.  They are all alive and well even with the rain we've had this year.  <br/>
I hope that if someone finds a box of mine that is wet, that they will dry off the inside and bag the contents with a dry bag inside - not outside - and let me know so that I can take care of the rest myself.<br/>
