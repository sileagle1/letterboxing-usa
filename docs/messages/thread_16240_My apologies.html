                    <div class="plaintext-content">Apparently, my open letter to people on this list has been taken in the wrong manner.  I am not attempting to rip-off the LBNa website.  My boxes are listed there as well as the PNWLb website.  The intent of the letter was to invite people residing in California, Hawaii or Nevada to come and check out a new website/database similar in content to the LBNa website. <br/>
<br/>
First and foremost, let me apologize for the apparent misunderstandings here. This Database is NOTHING at all like the database that was started at the Yahoo Groups site.  Not just anyone can say that a box is missing simply because they couldn't find it. I'm going to try and make it clear as possible here:<br/>
<br/>
ATTENTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
If you, the owner of a box, do NOT enter it into the Database at the PNWLb website, then it can, in NO way, ever have any entry into said database, NOR can it have a sitrep placed on it, since it does NOT and NEVER will exist in the PNWLb database.<br/>
<br/>
END MESSAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
However, the intent of this letter is not to clear up another's misconceptions, as they will keep those misconceptions no matter what. The intent of the letter was, as I stated, to invite people to come and take a look. If that is incorrect, or improper, then I was unaware that the webmaster of the LBNa site is also the group owner for the LBNa mailing list and that posts for something that, apparently is being taken as a rip off or a place for people to slam other peoples boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I do so appreciate the permission granted by several people to create a website of my own design, that's very nice of you to give me that and I do in fact appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and one last thing..... If, in any way, the fact that I have created a website that pertains to Letterboxing, or the fact that I've placed and 'ad' if you will, here on the LBNa mailing list, has come across in a 'cheeky' or less than honorable manner, then let me clear the air here on this.<br/>
<br/>
The LBNa website is something that I can only hope to recreate and emulate.  Wes has already done it all. I'm not doing anything new, nor am I claiming that I am. I'm merely doing it differently, in a different language.  I think that Wes has done a more than awesome job and my hat's off to him and his crew.  I am only responding to what the people that have come to my site have asked for.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I apologize if I have 'slapped anyone on the cheek' over this.<br/>
