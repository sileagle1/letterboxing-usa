to the new site? Eastern Mass is definitely not done. E.g. There are <br/>
about 28 boxes listed for Barnstable county in the old and only 18 in <br/>
the new...<br/>
If you need another hand to move boxes, please send me an email.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, guess I will be busy downloading clues from the old site <br/>
for boxes that were on my "to do" list. <br/>

&gt; Sometime shortly, letterboxing.org will point to the new site.  Its<br/>
&gt; hard to say exactly when this will occur, but it should all be done <br/>
by<br/>
&gt; this time next week.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This means the old site will become inaccessable (at least at that <br/>
url,<br/>
&gt; and at the ip address represented by www.letterboxing.org).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This also means that mail to webmasters at letterboxing.org, etc., <br/>
may<br/>
&gt; bounce for apparently arbitrary seeming reasons.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This also means access to either site may be unavailable for <br/>
apparently <br/>
&gt; arbitrary reasons as well, tho your neighbor may have fine access.<br/>
