Clear as mud? <br/>

Anyway, if anyone can point me to any off-list (maybe personal web <br/>
page?) clues for this area, I'd appreciate it!<br/>
<br/>
Also, perhaps Sugarloaf Mt isn't the Mt I am thinking of- the mt I am <br/>
thinking of is in this general area (NoVa/MD/PA), but is a tough climb. <br/>
Or tough-ish anyway. That's what I'm looking for, so any <br/>
recommendations on tough climbs are also appreciated. We're new to the <br/>
area, if you haven't gathered that already!<br/>
