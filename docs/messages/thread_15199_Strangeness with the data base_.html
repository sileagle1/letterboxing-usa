I believe that this post is a very good example of the problems that can occur with this new concept of having a data base. Until we were mentioned in Sir B's post about removing information on some else's letterbox, I had never visited the data base. We removed nothing. We did not even remove data regarding our boxes that are listed against our wishes. After looking over the site I exited and began typing in a request on all of our clue pages "Please contact the placer regarding the status rather than posting on the data base". We have quite a few letterboxes listed so it has taken quite a while to complete. This data base can and probably will be a continuing problem. If some one wants to have updated info on any of our letterboxes we are happy  to communicate with them!!!!!  If you want to know if I have removed something contact me directly. Don<br/>
