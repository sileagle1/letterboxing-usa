blazes in our hasty retreat down South Mountain.  <br/>
<br/>
According to Fireflylight, you will find the box after the 9th <br/>
blaze.  We only saw one "4 trees in one" tree on this path so you <br/>
should find the tree somewhere between 7 and 9 blazes.  <br/>
<br/>
Once I recover from the 4 and a half mile hike Sarah dragged me on, I <br/>
may drag her and Cat back up the mountain to double check.  Until <br/>
then, let us know how many blazes you count.<br/>
<br/>
Kudos once again to Fireflylight for the update and for letting us <br/>
know that she found our hitchhiker.  There is still one floating <br/>
around somewhere in MD unless someone nabbed it and didn't tell us.<br/>
<br/>
We are working on some devilish new schemes for upcoming boxes so <br/>
stay alert!  <br/>
