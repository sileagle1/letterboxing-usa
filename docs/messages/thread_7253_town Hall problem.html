                    <html><body>HI Mary,  I wasn't aware all of this had gone on.  I indeed did get permission to put TownHall's name on the website.  I am not sure who you talked to and am sorry for the bother and additional expense of the closed account.  I wish you had sent a note to me ...maybe I could have straightened things out.<br/>
  I just spoke to TownHall last week and received NO indication that there was any problem at all.  I will call them again today to to clear the air.<br/>
<br/>
Once again I am very sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Mohmers<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, let me add my 2 cents here:<br/>
<br/>
If you choose to order this way, make sure that you are willing to wait up<br/>
to several months for your check to clear, or use a money order.<br/>
<br/>
I had closed my account in July after a long time of no activity and before<br/>
Town Hall sent the patches or cashed the check. And although the closed<br/>
account should have just bounced the check back to Town Hall, and I could<br/>
have sent them a replacement check, the check forced my count to reopen and<br/>
overdraw (because the bank hadn't teller hadn't properly closed the account,<br/>
I was told the first time).  The check was for $10.75 and was written in<br/>
April.<br/>
<br/>
More interessting than that was I had tried to call Town Hall Embroidery and<br/>
the local operator said there was no such listing. However, they are<br/>
apparently listed as Town Hall Archery, and answer the phone as Town Hall<br/>
Sports.  I had left a detailed message on their answering machine about the<br/>
check the very day I had found out what had happened. No one bothered to<br/>
call me back.  I thought I must have had the wrong number, but I emailed<br/>
mohmers and I had been right, so I called again.<br/>
<br/>
This is where it starts to get interesting. I called back during business<br/>
hours and was put through to a woman who was very rude, terse, and<br/>
uncooperative, who claimed that they don't do patches for people, that she<br/>
had already complained and asked that her company name "be taken off that<br/>
internet thing" *last year* and still people are sending checks. And she<br/>
said that she wasn't even sure who it was in her company that was telling<br/>
people to order this way, but she was pretty sure it was a friend of one of<br/>
the workers there, but someone outside the company, still having people<br/>
order this way. She railed on about how she nor anyone else there has the<br/>
time to deal with this, that they only do large wholesale bulk patches.<br/>
Furthermore, she said she didn't want checks from anyone coming there unless<br/>
it was one check for the whole order.  She also claimed that she ended up<br/>
paying postage on these small orders because people don't send the right<br/>
amount, but I told her that I had put much more postage on the return<br/>
envelope than was required. She said she would not send back the check for a<br/>
replacement, and when I asked if I could just speak to whoever sends their<br/>
checks to the bank, she refused, again saying that she had no time for any<br/>
of this and wasn't about to walk down to another part of the building<br/>
because she had work to do.  Well, you can imagine my frustration. I was as<br/>
nice as I could be and pointed out that resending the check might reopen the<br/>
account and bounce again, causing me more problems, and her company would<br/>
still not get paid.  I wanted to send a replacement check from my new bank<br/>
but I needed the old check.  In the end, she agreed to take down my name and<br/>
phone number and put it on the desk of "the girl I think whose friend it is<br/>
that has people ordering these." Naturally, I never heard a word. What they<br/>
did was resubmit the check. And although my bank had assured me that one<br/>
check would not, could not, reopen the account, it did.  I just got another<br/>
month's statement with the overdraft and associated fees.  And no one at my<br/>
old bank has been able to tell me how this is happening (through the magic<br/>
of computers and their automated system, they think).<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that the woman I spoke to, who would not tell me her name,<br/>
was completely in a headspin over the patch orders or because someone hadn't<br/>
gotten permission to take the orders this way and was taking it out on me.<br/>
So, just be aware that whoever it is at Town Hall who supposedly does this<br/>
has created some rift within her company, and they *don't* return calls, at<br/>
least long distance ones.  Unless Mohmers is going to see through the patch<br/>
ordering, I'd be very leery of doing business with that place.<br/>

<div>Hi, Kay,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well, I certainly don't 
blame you for my experience, so there is no need to apologize.  As I said, 
I sensed that this woman was frazzled and chose to take it all on me.  
I had emailed you in July when the problem first was apparent and you sent me 
their number, and thanked me for trying to straighten it out.  I don't 
know if having you call them would have made any difference; it may have.  
I'm glad your contacts there have not been as rude to you as mine.  I 
think it's better that you are going to handle things for the group from this 
point on.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Yes, please let me know if 
you can figure out what is going on with that check.  I just want it back 
so I can send them a new one.  AFAIK, my bank never paid it.  But that 
bank is very confused these days... and so am I, in turn.  :-P  I 
certainly wouldn't want this mix-up to hamper anyone else's order from 
LbNA.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Best regards,</div>
<div>Mary (RI)</div>
