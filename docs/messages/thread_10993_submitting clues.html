<div>I submitted a clue for a new letterbox in the 
Bellingham, WA area about a month ago and it hasn't been posted yet.  I am 
wondering how long it takes to get it posted.  My kids are dying to go 
check it and see if anyone has found it.  
Thanks!</div></body></html>

Sometimes unfortunately clue postings fall through the cracks. I would<br/>
resubmit to the group and put in big letters at the very beginning of<br/>
the body of the message that this is a resubmission because the first<br/>
submission didn't seem to take. <br/>
<br/>
Also, make sure you're titling your subject line in a helpful way. If<br/>
you didn't title it something to the effect of "New Box in Bellingham,<br/>
WA," it might have been accidentally overlooked amid the large amount<br/>
of postings on all sorts of topics that flood this group every day.<br/>
<br/>
  I am wondering how long it takes to get it posted.<br/>
<br/>
It can depend on the webmanager's schedule for your region as well.<br/>
The webmanagers are volunteers, and life committments may interfere.<br/>
The webmanagers for the Mid-Atlantic region usually get ours up in 1-2<br/>
weeks.<br/>
<br/>
  My kids are dying to go check it and see if anyone has found it.  <br/>
<br/>
I understand that eagerness! Ya'll should go on and check on your box<br/>
because even though the clues haven't made it to letterboxing.org,<br/>
area boxers surely saw your original posting to the group, and surely<br/>
some of them printed off the posting and went about their merry way!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
