I'm not saying where I found it, or when, or where it's going I <br/>

&gt; A cuckoo clue is an unpublished clue that is hidden inside another <br/>
&gt; letterbox (like you might find a clue to a bonus box inside a <br/>
&gt; letterbox).  The difference between a bonus and a cuckoo is that the <br/>
&gt; cuckoo clue travels and it is not necessary connected in any way to <br/>
&gt; the box where you find it -- it may not even be located anywhere <br/>
&gt; nearby (or even in the same state for that matter).  Unlike a bonus <br/>
&gt; clue, which stays in the box where you found it, when you find a <br/>
&gt; cuckoo clue you are supposed to move it to another letterbox (in the <br/>
&gt; same way as you would move a HH).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There can be variations on the cuckoo clue.  Sometimes when you find <br/>
&gt; one, you are free to move it to any other letterbox anywhere -- could <br/>
&gt; be in the same park, could be clear across the country.  Sometimes a <br/>
&gt; planter will place a cuckoo clue with instructions to move it only <br/>
&gt; within a specific city, park or series of boxes (i.e. my 'Words in the <br/>
&gt; Woods' series).  Some cuckoo clues are just clues, some have their own <br/>
&gt; log book.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ryan, would your hidden clues be the "cuckoo" type?  I have read <br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; cuckoo clues, but I have never actually uncovered any in my neck of <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; woods.  If they are not cuckoo, can someone explain cukoo clues in <br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt; than general terms as cited on the FAQs at LBNA?  <br/>
