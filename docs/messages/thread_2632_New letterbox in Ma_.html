I had time to find 2 of the 4 boxes at Moose Hill- and look forward <br/>
to finding the other 2 soon! Had fun!!<br/>
<br/>
Also, I went to DeCordova to put more info sheets in the box- there <br/>
have been 30+ visitors and there's new scupltures in the park!  The <br/>
trail leading to the letterbox is very vague now to the biggest pile <br/>
of trees, but people still easily find the box.<br/>

Have a good weekend all,<br/>

I tracked this one down with my friend Kim yesterday.  The poison ivy <br/>
wasn't so bad (haven't begun to itch yet, anyway!), and it's a <br/>
lovely, and apparently extremely popular, site.  We had to wait about <br/>
an hour before the coast was clear enough to retrieve the box!<br/>

We were second to stamp in after Lonemasswolf and You Inspire My <br/>
