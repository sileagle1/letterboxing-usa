I have never met Brian but I think I might know what he was doing here and believe it was misunderstood. A few months ago (and I'm sure several "few months ago" over the years) there was all kinds of dicussion on the list as to how to handle the questions that come from newbies, of which I am still one. There were suggestions to the webmaster to put in their first post verification suggestiong that they might want to read the FAQ's and Getting Started section ASAP as many of their questions would be answered there. I don't think this ever came about. Then Mark Pepe created the "Newboxers" list (God bless 'im!) and there was lot's of discussion as to how to best advise new boxers of all of these resources. Someone suggested when a new boxer posts, whoever wanted to woould reply and give them all the info they will to know where to start their research. I replied offline right away, as I am sure several others did. Several also replied online too. I believe, without having ever spoken<br/>
 to Brian, that that is what Brian was saying. "Quick, someone reply with the required resources", based on the whole string we had been through a couple of months ago. Brain was very involved in the discussion. We suggested someone should post "got this one" or something but I didn't do it. My bad. Anyway, again, I only know Brian from his posts to this lists (plus the newboxers list) but I am thinking that's what he meant. Or I could be wrong and he could just be really cranky today! Just trying to help,<br/>

this ever came about. Then Mark Pepe created the "Newboxers" list <br/>
(God bless 'im!) and there was lot's of discussion as to how to best <br/>
advise new boxers of all of these resources. Someone suggested when <br/>
a new boxer posts, whoever wanted to woould reply and give them all <br/>
the info they will to know where to start their research. I replied <br/>
offline right away, as I am sure several others did. Several also <br/>
replied online too. I believe, without having ever spoken<br/>
&gt;  to Brian, that that is what Brian was saying. "Quick, someone <br/>
reply with the required resources", based on the whole string we had <br/>
been through a couple of months ago. Brain was very involved in the <br/>
discussion. We suggested someone should post "got this one" or <br/>
something but I didn't do it. My bad. Anyway, again, I only know <br/>
Brian from his posts to this lists (plus the newboxers list) but I <br/>
am thinking that's what he meant. Or I could be wrong and he could <br/>
just be really cranky today! Just trying to help,<br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>

I have never met Brian but I think I might know what he was doing here and<br/>
believe it was misunderstood. A few months ago (and I'm sure several "few<br/>
months ago" over the years) there was all kinds of dicussion on the list as<br/>
to how to handle the questions that come from newbies, of which I am still<br/>
one. There were suggestions to the webmaster to put in their first post<br/>
verification suggestiong that they might want to read the FAQ's and Getting<br/>
Started section ASAP as many of their questions would be answered there. I<br/>
don't think this ever came about. Then Mark Pepe created the "Newboxers"<br/>
list (God bless 'im!) and there was lot's of discussion as to how to best<br/>
advise new boxers of all of these resources. Someone suggested when a new<br/>
boxer posts, whoever wanted to woould reply and give them all the info they<br/>
will to know where to start their research. I replied offline right away, as<br/>
I am sure several others did. Several also replied online too. I believe,<br/>
without having ever spoken<br/>
to Brian, that that is what Brian was saying. "Quick, someone reply with the<br/>
required resources", based on the whole string we had been through a couple<br/>
of months ago. Brain was very involved in the discussion. We suggested<br/>
someone should post "got this one" or something but I didn't do it. My bad.<br/>
Anyway, again, I only know Brian from his posts to this lists (plus the<br/>

and he could just be really cranky today! Just trying to help,<br/>

Perhaps when one actually starts flaming newbies.  It's probably a <br/>
personal thing.  A couple of older posts lampoon the elite/newbie <br/>
divide (thanks to H+H for reminding us about and forwarding these a <br/>
few weeks ago):<br/>
