For me, it depends on the trip, the location, possible duration of the walk etc. Sometimes I do, mostly I don't. Pre letterboxing, while taking a hike, shooting a .38 over their heads and lunging at them with a knife scared off 2 coyotes that attacked my dog Brandi on a remote trail. She needed several stitches to her belly. If they weren't tumbling around the ground with her, the shot wouldn't have been in the air......Chuck &amp; Molly<br/>

seemed as though some folks were alarmed that one<br/>
letterboxer in my particular area carried a gun with<br/>
her on one occasion as she boxed with her young<br/>
children, and I hoped to point out that this would not<br/>
be considered unusual in our area since many people<br/>
carry guns as a part of their daily lives here.  No<br/>
one would argue that guns can be very dangerous when<br/>
handled improperly, but there are lots of folks who<br/>
handle them safely and responsibly every day.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure this is quite a sensitive issue to many<br/>
folks, but really, it isn't relevant to letterboxing,<br/>
except as it relates to the fact that we are all<br/>
concerned about our own and each other's safety when<br/>
we are isolated in the woods.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the topic of being safe as we letterbox is a<br/>
great issue that needs to be discussed periodically. <br/>
If it would help us get back to the real topic this<br/>
revolves around, I'll apologize now for perpetuating<br/>
the topic of carrying a gun while letterboxing, but it<br/>
seemed as though we were getting away from what could<br/>
be a really good discussion and instead were going to<br/>
get sidetracked by questioning an individual's<br/>
judgment.<br/>
