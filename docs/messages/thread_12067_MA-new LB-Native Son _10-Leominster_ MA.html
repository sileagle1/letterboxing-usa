The Return of Buckskin Sam<br/>
<br/>
It had been awhile since the spirit of ole Buckskin Sam had visited the town of his birth. He was tired and was looking for a place to rest among friends. When he strode into town he couldn't help but notice how many things had changed. Most of the apple orchards were gone and the site where his family home had been was now a vacant school. He recalled the time he and Kit Carson had gotten into a passel of trouble for getting inebriated in that very spot. His family was so riled up that they ran him and Kit right out of town. Nope, the Leominster relations didn't exactly take a liking to how Sam had turned out and they wasted no opportunity in letting him know. From his viewpoint he had done just fine. He had sailed around Cape Horn, was a Texas Ranger, had fought in the Civil War for both the North and the South, was an Indian scout with Kit Carson and Buffalo Bill Cody, had saved an Indian village from a raging fever..and that was just for starters. One of the things he was most proud of was that he was a published author with more than 50 dime-store novels to his credit. Why, every boy in the country probably wished they were Buckskin Sam when they read about his adventures in titles such as "Kit Carson Jr., Crackshot of the West" or Double Dan, the Dastard". But there wasn't any use in trying to change the minds of these kinfolk of his, why even his own dear mother burned every book he had ever sent home. Sam thought long and hard and finally came up with the one place a fellow such as him would be welcome and amongst friends. He set his course in the direction of 30 West Street and entering the front door tipped his hat to the little lady behind the counter. "Ma'am," he said "could you be so kind as to direct me to the Westerns." The librarian at the front desk could scarcely believe her eyes at the sight of the tall, longhaired stranger with the wide brimmed hat and buckskin jacket. "We don't have a "Westerns" section per se, they are mixed in with the general fiction, although they do have a sticker identifying them on the bottom of the spine." Old Sam could scarcely believe it, no western section, how could he ever rest in peace? As he scanned the library his eyes came to rest on the portrait of Miss Florence Wheeler, why that was the lady who had realized Buckskin Sam's contribution to Leominster history and had obtained copies of his books for the collection. His mind was made up; he would rest under the watchful gaze of Miss Wheeler. To find the Buckskin Sam letterbox, walk up to the portrait of Florence Wheeler and look behind the books on the bottom shelf. <br/>
<br/>
The librarians know of ole Sam's presence but please be discreet when finding and replacing him so no varmints get ahold of him.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you kindly.<br/>
