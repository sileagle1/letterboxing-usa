<br/>
*** Alive and well 1/11/2004 ***<br/>
<br/>
	In the Buckeye county seat named for Old Hickory, there is a <br/>
necropolis on a beautiful mountain.  In the extreme northwest of this <br/>
necropolis is a large tomb for a King.  Stand at the east end of this <br/>
tomb and take a bearing of 35 degrees.  Approximately 24 paces away <br/>
(1 pace = 2 steps) is a tall tree.  At the base of this tree on the <br/>
northeast side you should find what you seek under some fallen <br/>
limbs.  Take care not to be seen and rehide carefully  several boxes <br/>
have disappeared from this necropolis.<br/>
<br/>
	This is a hitchhiker hostel  not a conventional letterbox.  <br/>
The hostel has no stamp of it's own.  There should always be at least <br/>
3 hitchhikers in residence here.  Feel free to exchange them on a one-<br/>
for-one basis or leave an extra one if there's room but make sure <br/>
there are at least three still there when you leave.  The hostel does <br/>
have it's own log.  Please stamp in any hitchhikers you place in <br/>
residence here and note what it was exchanged for.  Happy hunting!<br/>
<br/>
