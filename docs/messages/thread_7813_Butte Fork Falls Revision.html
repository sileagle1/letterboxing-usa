I received an e-mail questioning the rise in elevation for this trail and upon further figuring, I should probably revise it from 1500 feet to about 800 feet.  I had used information from a trail book for a trail that seemed close to the same but after thinking about it and looking at some other trails I have climbed, I was probably off by a few hundred feet.  The person who sent me the e-mail said they will hike it and give me their best estimate but for now if you could revise it to 800 feet, that would be great.  I may have to let you know if it needs to be changed again later.  <br/> <br/>I'm sorry but I am a beginner when it comes to reading maps and all, so I have to guess at distances and elevations.  I'm learning though.<br/> <br/>Thanks for your help,<br/> <br/>Judi (tecihila)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></td></tr></table><p></p><hr/>Changed your e-mail?  Keep your contacts!
