Back from a great trip to Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.  Wanda met me at the <br/>
Houston airport with a Brazos Bend T-shirt - a most useful present as it was quite a <br/>
bit warmer there than in New England!  After she showed me a few of the dozens of <br/>
Houston area letterboxes that she had done earlier, we skipped on up to the Dallas <br/>
area where she got her F7000 at Crazy Christmas, and I reached F4500 at <br/>
Flamingos in Love.  Then it was on to Oklahoma City for a very nice Cabin Fever <br/>
gathering and visit with Happydays.  We love to see how the hobby is growing all <br/>
around the country, and contributed our wee little bit by adding on 2 boxes in TX, 2 <br/>
in OK, and 2 in AR with stamps carved by RTRW of CT.  Will get them listed soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the fun,<br/>
<br/>
