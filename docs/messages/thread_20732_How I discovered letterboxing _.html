<br/>
I discovered letterboxing through one of the<br/>
associates at our local Michaels.  I took my daughter<br/>
to Kids Crafts every Saturday morning, and one time I<br/>
noticed a display for a stamp-carving class on the<br/>
wall.  I was curious, so I wandered over while the<br/>
little one was pasting away (she was 4 at the time). <br/>
On the display (along with the stamping stuff) was<br/>
small book showing several stamps and some journaling,<br/>
some pictures of the trail and the location of the<br/>
letterbox, and a set of clues to a letterbox.  (Now<br/>
before some of you get horrified that the stamps were<br/>
displayed, I found out later that the logbook, stamps<br/>
in the book, pictures, and the set of clues were<br/>
"mock-ups" made up by her and not letterboxes that<br/>
were really in existance.  She didn't want to show her<br/>
own log book in the interest of keeping the stamps she<br/>
found private).  So while my daughter was finishing up<br/>
her craft, I asked the instructor if she knew anything<br/>
about the letterboxing display.  Turns out that she<br/>
had done it, and her whole family was into<br/>
letterboxing.  After talking to her in detail, I<br/>
decided that this sounded like something that would be<br/>
family-oriented and interesting.  So I signed up for<br/>
the class, and got hooked.<br/>
<br/>
I don't get out to box as often as I'd like to due to<br/>
medical reasons unfortunately.  But the weekends I'm<br/>
able to, I'm out on the trail.  My husband at first<br/>
thought it was the dumbest thing he'd ever heard of,<br/>
but after the first trip he was hooked as well.  It's<br/>
always a scramble to see who in the family finds the<br/>
box first. <br/>
<br/>
It's usually our daughter!!!<br/>

I was reading my sister's blog and she mentioned she had been helping a friend<br/>
solve a code that was in a letterboxing clue. I wondered what she was talking<br/>
about, so I googled letterboxing and ran into the letterboxing.org site. I read<br/>
all about it, discovered that there were boxes hidden right here in my hometown,<br/>
and that weekend I went and found the first box; I was hooked immediately!<br/>

I actually found out about letterboxing through the geocaching <br/>
website. (GASP!) My 15 month old stumbled upon a geocache while we <br/>
were on vacation (even though it was well-hidden.) When we got home <br/>
I took a look at the website and was interested, but couldn't afford <br/>
the GPS unit. (At least until Christmas, maybe.=) I was doing more <br/>
research when one of the links to "other hide-and-seek games" led me <br/>
to letterboxing. I thought it was just a brilliant idea and a great <br/>
way to get a bit more exercise and keep the creative juices flowing. <br/>
And it has been!<br/>
<br/>
And thanks Anna Lisa, for introducing me to that wonderful music! I <br/>
would really like to own such an album, but couldn't find that it <br/>
existed. Have you been able to find one? Googling just turned up a <br/>
bunch of awards she has received.<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I first heard of letterboxing in the early '80s from one of my (MANY) penpals who letterboxed in Dartmoor.  She explained the sport to me and I was sooooo jealous that Britain had this really cool thing but here I was stuck in America.  I forgot all about it.  Then last fall I saw a little article in Prevention Magazine about letterboxing, and vaguely remembered I'd heard of it before.  The article gave a link to letterboxing.org, and from there I was hooked!!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Just curious if any of you were in the "penpal circuit" in the '70s and '80s.  We used to circulate little booklets called F.B.'s (Friendship Books) and SLAMS..where we'd enter our name and address, hobbies, fave bands, etc.  Slams had questions each person got to answer.  NOw that I've found letterboxing, it seems like a hobby former penpallish types would be involved in.  --Papeseed <br/>

"It was the fall of 2003.  Doodle was talking to Deedle about Squire's Castle, which her family visited on several Sunday afternoon drives during her childhood.  Not able to believe that he grew up in Cleveland and had never heard of the place, she did an internet search to find information to send him.  During the search, she stumbled across a page for this thing called a "letterbox" hidden somewhere in the woods behind the castle.  Intrigued, she followed the link on the page to the LbNA main webpage and read and read.  She sent Deedle an e-mail mentioning that she had decided that she had a new hobby, and she'd tell him all about it later that night.  Deedle wrote back, saying that he, too, had discovered a new hobby, and by any chance would it be called letterboxing?  He had done his own internet search and found the same clue page that Doodle did!  So of course, when we were finally ready to venture out on the trail, our first box hunt was for that Squire's Castle box"<br/>

Ironicially, we didn't find the Squire's Castle box on our first outing (and haven't found it yet because it went missing, and then has recently been replaced but we haven't had a chance to head back out that way yet).  But we love all the interesting places we've been sent to to find letterboxes, places that yes, we've never heard of even though we've lived in Cleveland our entire lives :)<br/>

<br/>
I was just doing something on my blog on blogger.com (http://theprynce.blogspot.com) and I went to the Blogger home page and it has a list of the most recently updated blogs on the front page and one of them was "Letterboxes of I-95" or something like that and, since I live on I-95 and it's VERY boring in my town, I clicked it hoping it would be something I could see sometime.<br/>
Well I went and I found out that there was one near my house at South of the Border and I went down there a few days later to go for an interview on the NC side of the border and on the way back through SOB, I told my friend about letterboxing and told him to go behind the coffeehouse so he did and we did what the directions said and couldn't find the box which just annoyed us but we left anyway and came back another day and that was that 'cause we found it.  Then we started on all the letterboxes in Florence, SC and a couple in Myrtle Beach and we got hooked and we recently made our first plants in Myrtle Beach!<br/>
<br/>
I'm done.  lol.  Sorry.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [LbNA] How I discovered letterboxing !<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That's a great question, KitKat, and I'm sure you will hear 500 different answers!  I stumbled upon letterboxing in an interesting way, so I'll share my story. It's a little long, but fun. (I changed the subject line to reflect your question) Well, back in April,  I was listening to an NPR interview (the program was Day to Day) which fascinated me.  It was about a native Sioux woman who had a dream of becoming an opera singer, and she surmounted all the odds (no teacher, no piano, rural N. or S. Dakota, etc.!) and realized her dream.  Her name is Bonnie Jo Hunt, and she sounds perfectly delightful.  She has done a recording on which she actually sings with the slowed-down sounds of real crickets.  The sound nearly brought me to tears, it was so much like a gorgeous human choir.  You might hear it this fall on a TBS series or program called "The Native American". ANYWAY, I had to go online to find out more about this and let my family hear the interview.  Just below that link, there was a link called "letterboxing", because earlier that day they had done a little blurb about letterboxes in D.C.  Well, I love interesting and unusual words, and had never run across this one before.  I immediately clicked on it to satisfy my curiosity.  Lo and behold, I was taken to "letterboxing.org" and my artistic eye was hooked right away by the great look of the site.  I now know (thanks to Mark Pepe's interview with Legerdemaine) that it was mostly designed by this letterboxing legend.  Then, like many of us, I couldn't believe there were really little boxes hidden all over the place and I'd been walking right by them all these years.  I couldn't wait to go find one and make sure it was true!  And, well, the rest is history.  Oh-- and if anyone wants the link for the interview on which you can hear the cricket songs, here it is : http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1838534   I hope it comes through ok.  If not, try going to http://www.npr.org and searching under Bonnie Jo Hunt, April 15 2004 on Day to Day.  Sorry so long-winded!  That's why I'm so far called  --lunaryakketyact<br/>

such a sense of discovery when I learned about letterboxing, that I thought it would <br/>
be interesting to hear how others found the "secret".<br/>

It looked interesting enough to look for our first one in East Granby, CT - Oh What a View and Holy Cow. <br/>

We have been LBing ever since, although not to the numbers of some, (closing in on 400 F), but the enjoyment of the places we see  and the people we have met has been most rewarding.<br/>

I was on trails long before I was a Rotarian.  I just wasn't looking <br/>
for letterboxes.<br/>
