<br/>
At my daughters school I did a "letterboxing" hunt for Valentines day. I hid<br/>
6 boxes and then split the kids up into 4 groups. This kept group sizes down<br/>
to a minimum. I started each group off at a different box with the same<br/>
order. This kept the "stamping in" time to a minimum so they were less<br/>
likely to get bored waiting for their turn. Instead of having them each make<br/>
their own stamps I let them each carry a washable marker of their choice and<br/>
use their thumbprint. It was quick and easy. They each got to stamp the box<br/>
stamp in their "book" they'd made. They loved solving the "clues", loved<br/>
stamping in, and loved taking their book home with them. After the party I<br/>
tossed all the log books from the boxes and rehid them out in the public as<br/>
regular letterboxes. All boxes for the party were hid in the school or on<br/>
the playground.<br/>
