On August 30th Funhog placed the Route 36 letterbox in Tehama County near
the town of Red Bluff, California. This is almost a drive-up letterbox.
It marks a spot, where Nature, both Mother and Human, have collaborated
to create something incredible.
<br/>To the letterbox:
<br/>Go east from I-5 in Red Bluff to the junction of Highways 36 and 99.
Go exactly 10 miles on Route 36 to a generous parking area on the right
side of the road. You <u>will</u> know the spot. Go uphill along the fenceline
to a large pine tree. Sixteen paces beyond this tree is a small thicket
with a large boulder on the left side. The letterbox is hidden beneath
this boulder marked with a stick. Happy Trails, Funhog</p></body></html>
