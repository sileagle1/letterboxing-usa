A treasure awaits for the first of you.<br/>
<br/>
I've tried to be plain yet secret enough,<br/>
For the educated this is not very tough.<br/>

NVCC is where you will start,<br/>
I warn you this is not for the faint of heart. <br/>

On a glacier ridge this trail was begun,<br/>
But cleared by a boy scout for eagle fun.<br/>

Take ALL the facts and do a search.<br/>
Look under the snow on top of the earth. <br/>
