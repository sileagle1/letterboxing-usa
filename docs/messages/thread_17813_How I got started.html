                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm another one who came to this sport from geocaching.  I found geocaching because I <br/>
am a big fan of the books/movies Planet of the Apes.  While reading online info about the <br/>
Tim Burton movie, I found the special geocaches that were being hidden with movie props <br/>
and moved from there to geocaching.<br/>
<br/>
I've enjoyed geocaching, but I often find it frustrating.  Either I"m not very good with my <br/>
gps, or every other one that I look for is hidden in a spot with large trees where it's hard to <br/>
get a lock.<br/>
<br/>
Once I found the letterboxing site as a link from someone's "other treasure hunting" sites <br/>
list, I found my real place.  I'm MUCH happier, not finding a letterbox because I couldn't <br/>
quite figure out what the clues mean, than I am not finding a geocache because my gps <br/>
will only give me "accuracy up to 120 feet" (that's a BIG circle!)<br/>
<br/>
Besides, now I'm branching off into the carving aspect of it all and THAT'S enormous fun.  <br/>
It's really cool to carve something and think to myself, "Wow!  I did that!"<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I read the Family Fun article just a couple of weeks before we left on <br/>
vacation, and my reaction was immediate:   "I HAVE to do this!!!!"   So I got a <br/>
store-bought stamp and logbook and found some boxes we'd be near on vacation.   <br/>
Loved it.   Still love it.   <g><br/>
<br/>
I've found several geocaches as well, mostly because there aren't all that <br/>
many letterboxes in the area yet (though I'm trying!) and I needed to feed my <br/>
new treasure hunting habit.   Interestingly, I haven't used the GPS to find any <br/>
of them.   I found all four of them "the letterboxing way," using just clues!<br/>
