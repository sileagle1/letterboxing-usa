Finally found the time after the winter and my school<br/>
activities to letterbox again!!  I was so excited and<br/>
ended up finding some great boxes.<br/>
My family and I enjoyed the boxes placed in the<br/>
McKeldin area of Patapsco The Maryland, my Maryland<br/>
placed by Firefly and one by psychomommy and the<br/>
turtle and Box it Up by ADG.. thanks all for a great<br/>
day of hiking and letterboxing...<br/>
just a side note.. we could not find firefly's first<br/>
box in the series.. has anyone seen it recently?? And<br/>
if anyone else plans to  visit those boxes, the books<br/>
are getting full and you might want to bring a small<br/>
replacement.. looks like you hid them in a great place<br/>
firefly!<br/>
still looking for my first HH and exchange!!<br/>
