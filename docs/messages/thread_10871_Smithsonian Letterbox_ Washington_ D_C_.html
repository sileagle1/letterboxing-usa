                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello Boxers!  This is my first post to letterboxing.  I am writing to<br/>
report that my husband and I kicked off what we hope is a long habit<br/>
of finding these wonderful things with a trip last week to the<br/>
Smithsonian castle just hours before the big snow storm shut the town<br/>
down! <br/>
<br/>
 We were nervous as cats and dithered around the lobby until I worried<br/>
that the guard would get suspicious. So, throwing caution to the wind,<br/>
I marched up to him and asked where I could find a water fountain.  He<br/>
directed us and we approached the water fountain where the box was<br/>
hidden and couldn't find it!! Finally, I went back, blatently fumbled<br/>
around under the fountain and there it was!  We took it to a<br/>
comfortable couch nearby and unrolled the long strip of "rice paper?"<br/>
with all its wonderful stamps.  We added ours although we hope to have<br/>
better ones in the future, wrote our "names" and carefully replaced<br/>
the whole thing after stamping our books with the one in the microbox. <br/>
<br/>
 It was all great fun and the guard was clueless which may or may not<br/>
be a good thing.  Thanks!!  As soon as we are able to see the ground<br/>
around the south shore of Massachusetts, we will reciprocate. <br/>
