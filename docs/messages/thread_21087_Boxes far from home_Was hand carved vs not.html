Heck, many of the first letterboxes that were in the Las Vegas area <br/>
were planted by visitors to the area...and now there are people who <br/>
live in the area that were turned onto letterboxing and 'lo and <br/>
behold, there were boxes already there for them to find!<br/>
<br/>
The same is true for much of Florida. When I first started hiding <br/>
letterboxes in the Tampa area, no one who lived there was <br/>
letterboxing and now there are several folks. <br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite "rules" of letterboxing is: If you plant them they <br/>
will come! and it is proved true over and over again! Georgia wasn't <br/>
much of a letterboxing mecca. Ryan and Jolly GMan had planted a <br/>
couple of boxes a few years ago (again on visits to the area). And <br/>
now Georgia is a HOTBED of letterboxing activity. <br/>
<br/>
Ryan and I are planning a road trip to Montana and North and South <br/>
Dakota this summer and we hope to find and plant letterboxes along <br/>
the way. It sure would be great if there were some more in Eastern <br/>
Montana for us to find! <br/>

I'd venture to guess that almost every letterbox planted on the <br/>
Hawaiian Islands was planted by somebody just visiting for a bit.  <br/>
At least that was the case the last time we were there.  Amazingly, <br/>
most of the boxes have survived over the years, too.<br/>

I hope to do the same for Western KY, with my occaisional trips out <br/>
there.  The Land Between the Lakes is ripe for a couple....<br/>
<br/>
My other area of travel, Houston, is pretty well laden, so I can be a <br/>
letterbox consumer down there....<br/>

Amanda, let me know where you are going in general and when.  I will <br/>
leave some in MT for you both.  I have been so pleased to have found <br/>
the ones you left on your last trip this direction.  When I began <br/>
letterboxing, it was only A-Bear and I in a fairly large state.  I <br/>
was so excited to learn of some of your boxes.  I have driven hours <br/>
to find a couple of your boxes.  I would love to return the favor of <br/>
having some for you to find.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I will always be grateful for traveling planters.  I <br/>
would have been the only one planting letterboxes within hundreds of <br/>
miles if it weren't for a few kind souls who took pity on a lone <br/>
letterboxer until I finally got one other letterboxer in my side of <br/>
the state.  I have also spent many an afternoon checking box status <br/>
or doing first aid for those boxers to help repay their favor to me.<br/>
<br/>
Happy holidays,<br/>
