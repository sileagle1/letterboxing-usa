HA!HA!HA!<br/>
<br/>
Just think, you could be the first to hold a Maryland letterboxing <br/>
sleepover. And just maybe a first in the US. COOL! <br/>
<br/>
HA! HA! <br/>
 Lizardbutt, Bookworm and I can take a red-eye flight to make it in <br/>
time for breakfast. I'll make my famous coffee. <br/>
<br/>
Guess Who?<br/>
And don't you dare call me at 9a.m. your time.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; So, Psychomommy, when can you put Sarah, Cat, and I up for the <br/>
&gt; night?  We won't take up too much space and if we get bored, we <br/>
might <br/>
&gt; place a couple of boxes in your yard, crawlspace, toilet, etc.<br/>
&gt; (hee, hee)  <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Patapsco Valley State Park McKeldin Area<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Nearest Town: Marriotsville, MD<br/>
&gt; &gt;   County: Carroll<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Date Placed: September 14, 2002<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Placed by: Psychomommy and The Turtle<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Clue difficulty: Easy<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Hike difficulty: Easy, Approx. .7 mile hike<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   To reach the McKeldin Area: From 695, take I70 to exit 83 for <br/>
&gt; &gt; Marriotsville Road. Go North on Marriotsville Road for 4 miles to <br/>
&gt; &gt; entrance to the park on the right.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   From I70 East, take Route 40 to Marriotsville Road. Turn left. <br/>
&gt; Park <br/>
&gt; &gt; is 5 miles on the right.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Enter park and drive to entrance gate. Be prepared to pay <br/>
&gt; &gt; $2.00/person if guard is on duty. Park at the lot ahead. Ask for <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; &gt; map ($1.00, I recommend the bought over the xerox copy) <br/>
&gt; &gt;   From your car, walk back to the gate house and cross the road <br/>
&gt; &gt; heading towards the sign that says Spring Glen Trail. <br/>
&gt; &gt;   IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE FIREFLYS' MARYLAND SERIES FIRST I RECOMMEND <br/>
&gt; IT. <br/>
&gt; &gt; HERS ENDS WHERE OURS BEGIN. OTHERWISE PLEASE CONTINUE. <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Start at the Spring Glen Trail. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Box 1<br/>
&gt; &gt;   BAA BAA BLACK SHEEP<br/>
&gt; &gt;   From the map board travel along the trail to the first 2 in 1 <br/>
&gt; tree <br/>
&gt; &gt; on the left. Count 7 blue blazes (only ones facing you). See the <br/>
&gt; &gt; pines, stop at the first pine. Count 25 steps. See the large <br/>
curly-<br/>
&gt; q <br/>
&gt; &gt; snake to the right! Look left. Find the fallen tree that looks <br/>
like <br/>
&gt; &gt; driftwood. There you will find #1.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Box 2<br/>
&gt; &gt;   SHEEP IN THE MEADOW, COWS IN THE CORN<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Continue down the trail. Cross 2 speed bumps, STOP! Watch out <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; &gt; galloping deer. The stream should be on your left. #3 speed bump -<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; There's fungus among us! Keep going!!! Go to the top of the hill. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Nope it's not here! Walk a little farther look for the tree with <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; knee. Stop. Look right to the cluster of trees. You will find <br/>
your <br/>
&gt; &gt; treasure behind the dead one. TIP TOE THRU THE FERNS<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Box 3<br/>
&gt; &gt;   SHEEP GO TO HEAVEN, GOATS GO TO HELL<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Continue on the path to the fork in the trail. The Spring Glen <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; &gt; your friend. Head for the bottom of the hill. WATCH WHERE THE'RE <br/>
&gt; &gt; LYING NOT WHERE THE'RE FLYING or you will take a trip. Hop the <br/>
&gt; &gt; stream, flowing or not. Start counting left blazes only. After <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; 7 <br/>
&gt; &gt; blaze look to the right for the old rock wall. Now count 2 right <br/>
&gt; &gt; blazes. See the hanging extraterrestrials!!!! Go 2 more right <br/>
&gt; blazes. <br/>
&gt; &gt; STOP Look back to ET and take 6 steps- look right in the middle <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; 3 <br/>
&gt; &gt; you will find what you seek.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Continue up the hill.<br/>
&gt; &gt;                           THE END<br/>
