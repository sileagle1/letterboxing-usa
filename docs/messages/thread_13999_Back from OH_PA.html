                    <div class="plaintext-content">And what a great trip it's been! Best part was meeting the wonderful <br/>
letterboxing people, like Scoutdogs, Franzsolo, Ed, Ace, and all the <br/>
other fine folks who make us feel like "family" wherever we go! And <br/>
the letterboxing was pretty impressive, too! In spite of many boxes <br/>
being washed away in the recent floods and mud slides, plus some <br/>
being inaccessible to me because of excessive overgrowth, poison ivy, <br/>
work projects, weddings, and other factors, I still managed to find <br/>
nearly 200 boxes in Ohio, and passed the 100 mark in PA as well! Most <br/>
interesting to me were the "camo-boxes" and "non-traditional hides". <br/>
With well over 2500 traditional finds following the basic formula <br/>
of "look under rocks, behind tree, or at end of log", it was really a <br/>
blast for me to find boxes like Buckeye Furnace, Metamora Mill, <br/>
Yoctangee Baden, Loffelstein Challenge, and Pigs Can't Fly in some <br/>
rather unusual hiding spots!  Thanks for this delightful burst of <br/>
creativity and some great stamps, too!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of stamps, though, here's a funny story. The night before I <br/>
left Scoutdogs' home in Indiana, Chris finally got me to try my hand <br/>
at carving some PZ-cut under her magnifying glass setup - how cool!  <br/>
I carved a little oaken clip art image and placed it in western Ohio <br/>
the following morning. Then the next day as I was heading back east <br/>
to Eastfork, I came upon that very same carving, only slightly <br/>
larger, in one of Franzsolo's boxes, Up the Tree! Now, what are the <br/>
chances of that happening? My very first carved clip art stamp image <br/>
and it ends up being a "clone"!!! Anyway, for anyone who might want <br/>
to find my "smaller version", clues will be available soon on our <br/>
webpage. I also brought back a couple of hitchers and an example of <br/>
Scoutdogs' fantastic carving called "The Warrior" to be placed soon <br/>
in RI. I actually had a place in mind, and it just happened that <br/>
someone else recently put a box there, so stay tuned for another!  <br/>
And have a safe 4th of July weekend, happy letterboxers everywhere!<br/>

P.S. Just for the record (for the new folks out there or others that <br/>
don't know us, or need to somehow think that our count is inflated), <br/>
please be assured that our count is actually considerably LOWER than <br/>
what it would be if we counted the way we've heard some folks do! For <br/>
example, when we find a box with multiple stamps, we still only count <br/>
it as ONE FIND, even if there are a half dozen or more different <br/>
stamps in it! Secondly, we do not count stamps relocated to different <br/>
areas or most types of replacements. Thirdly, we wouldn't DREAM of <br/>
counting the same hitchers( or boxes or persons) again if we came <br/>
across them more than once! And, finally, Pete and I do keep separate <br/>
counts, so his count contains quite a few boxes that I haven't yet <br/>
gotten to, and vice versa. If we did the "composite thing", I'd <br/>
probably have well over F3000 by now, but hopefully I'll get there <br/>
soon enough as it is - especially with all the new boxes popping up <br/>
like crazy lately!<br/>
<br/>
P.P.S. And looks like I'll be getting a golden crown after all, for <br/>
that broken tooth of mine! It broke while Chris and I were eating <br/>
salad at our last night celebration dinner at the Olive Garden in <br/>
Cincinnati(the very same one that Pete and I ate at on our way out <br/>
west about 10 years ago!) Anyway, here I was thinking that I'd bitten <br/>
into an olive pit or something, and suddenly there's this hole in the <br/>
back of my mouth! Amazingly, I was able to get all the way back home <br/>
without pain and my dentist just took care of it right away. Thank <br/>
God for little mercies - and big ones, too!!! <br/>
