is too funny!!!!! I just learned of letter boxing last Wednesday and have been 
absolutely intrigued ever since. I have been on the website at least 3 times a 
day, trying to learn all I can!  And picking up materials (Stamp, pad,  ) 
to start my adventures in search of letter boxes!!! I mentioned in passing 
just this morning to my husband that some whereby the Genera; Lyon 
Memorial  would be a GREAT place to hide a box when we learn about it and the 
time comes to hide one. Then boom I turn on the computer and there is a message 
titled "New Box General Lyon Memorial" I guess great minds think a like! Maybe 
that should be my first search!!!! </span></div>

<p><strong>From the intersection of routes 198 and 44 in 
  Phoenixville, proceed south on route 198, quickly taking a left turn onto 
  General Lyon Road right after the commuter parking lot. Proceed down the road 
  to a cemetery on the right. It is .4 of a mile from the intersection of routes 
  198 and 44. Park along side the road. Go through the main gate and proceed to 
  the Lyon monument which is the tallest with an eagle on top. From the front of 
  the monument take a reading of 310 degrees and proceed to the back of the 
  cemetery to a shag bark hickory tree on the other side of the wall. There is 
  some small debris around the tree. Between the wall and the tree is the 
  letterbox covered with a small flat stone and leaves. For a small town, the 
  cemetery has quite a few stones of soldiers that died in various locations 
  during the civil war. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Who was General Lyon?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nathaniel Lyon was born on July 14, 1818. 
  He attended West Point and graduated 11th in his class of 52 in 1841. After 
  graduation, Lyon went on to serve in both the Seminole and Mexican wars. After 
  the Mexican War, Lyon was promoted to captain and was assigned to Fort Riley, 
  Kansas. There, he found himself in the middle of the turmoil associated with 
  "bleeding Kansas". In 1861, when Lyon was transferred to St. Louis, Missouri 
  was sharply divided between a pro-Confederate governor, Claiborne F. Jackson, 
  and a pro-Union legislature, with a valuable arsenal in St. Louis as the prize 
  for the victor. When the governor called out the state militia, allegedly to 
  train for home defense, Lyon grew suspicious and spied on the militia’s camp. 
  Concluding that Jackson intended to use the militia to seize the arsenal for 
  the Confederacy, he surrounded the camp with his own soldiers and captured it. 
  It was an ill-timed, hot-headed gesture, and a riot broke out in St. Louis 
  when Lyon paraded his prisoners through the city. Nevertheless, he had saved 
  the arsenal, and probably Missouri, for the Union.<span class="410122822-02072002"> </span>His action provoked Jackson to openly declare 
  for the Confederacy and call for outright insurrection. Lyon, who had been 
  promoted to brigadier general on May 17, mounted a campaign to drive him from 
  the state. The Confederates were waiting for Lyon on August 10 at Wilson’s 
  Creek near Springfield, Missouri. In a bloody battle generally considered a 
  Confederate victory, he was killed, impetuously trying to lead a last charge.

                    <html><body><p>This box would be a good example to see how letterboxes are made up. I think I made it fairly well.  It is also one of the easiest ones to find so probably a good start for you. I would also suggest the Stones Brook box that I posted today. It is very close to the General Lyon Memorial box, not a long hike but more of a challenge yet still good for a beginner. I leave stamped postcards in the boxes. Please mail me one and let me know of your progress in letterboxing. Good luck.....Chuck &amp; Molly
