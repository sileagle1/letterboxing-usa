                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last Thursday, 5/8, the box-announce list informed us that Wolfpack <br/>
had posted clues for a box at Carderock, MD (message 1071).  The <br/>
heading and subject line say PotomacCounty, which is not correct, but <br/>
the body of the clue says Montgomery County, which is correct.  <br/>
However, I can't find the clues in any county in Maryland. Why did we <br/>
get an automated message when the clues aren't there?  Did Wolfpack <br/>
already delete the whole thing?  Does this mean that the box is not <br/>
really there?<br/>
