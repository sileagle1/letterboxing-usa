                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd like to weigh in on the whole "first finders"<br/>
discussion....  I rushed out today to find a letterbox<br/>
in Suffield, CT to try to be the "first," only to<br/>
discover that someone beat me to it!  I personally<br/>
don't understand why both attitudes can't exist<br/>
simultaneously - for those of us who like the<br/>
challenge and competition of trying to be the first to<br/>
find a box, certificates sound like a great idea. <br/>
Perhaps we could add a tag to our signatures that<br/>
identifies how many times we were first?<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, for those of you who see letterboxing<br/>
should be a completely non-competitive activity,<br/>
simply skip the first page of the log when reading<br/>
through prior entries!  If you don't care whether you<br/>
are first or fifty first, that's great - but in that<br/>
case, if it is to be completely non-competitive,<br/>
what's the point of keeping count of how many you've<br/>
found?  Is that really that much different from trying<br/>
to be first to a box?<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, the flexibility to participate at<br/>
whatever level you choose is what makes letterboxing<br/>
so much fun.  It's an interesting and fun discussion<br/>
to have, but also rather unnecessary.<br/>
