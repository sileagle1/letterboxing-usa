The Happy Postman is happily delivering his mail to some of his best <br/>
friends in the forest of Lewisville Park's Nature trail in Battle <br/>
Ground, WA. Clues can be found on the National LB site at <br/>
www.letterboxing.org. Also, while you are there, check out <br/>
Soggy2pair's Lewisville Scramble LB. It is very lonely. In fact, <br/>
Cat's Meow and I were firsties in this logbook that had been sitting <br/>
there since last June. One word of warning though, The Stinging <br/>
Nettles are out in force on the trails so please do not wander off <br/>
the trail. Cat's Meow found out first hand how painful it can be but <br/>
thanks to grandma Purple Iris's wonder salve Wise Women, she was back <br/>
to her old frisky self and hiding boxes. Happy Hunting!<br/>
