&gt; Subject:       [L-USA] Generating Interest, Vandals, etc<br/>
<br/>
&gt; To Letterboxers All:<br/>
&gt; 	An interesting day of posts: My $0.02 USD (thanks Marty):<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; About Promotion:<br/>
&gt; 	I am in  agreement that we need to take a proactive approach to growing<br/>
&gt; this hobby - we've gotten a great start, for sure, but all of us would<br/>
&gt; like to have more boxes to look for, and growth is the way for this to<br/>
&gt; happen. 50 in YK2<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	However, I am not in favor of any sort of mass-promotion, via the new<br/>
&gt; or otherwise. Small articles, as those in rubber-stamp publications,<br/>
&gt; etc, are fine, and, as Graham suggested, perhaps targeting special<br/>
&gt; interest groups (bird watchers or boy scouts) also has merit. But I am<br/>
&gt; most in favor of keeping it local.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	We are each the seed of a nuculus that must grow in our respective<br/>
&gt; areas to make this work. If anyone of us can't generate enough interest<br/>
&gt; in our own backyard, we'll have nothing left to do but talk on the net<br/>
&gt; about it. I view the net primarily as a way for us to share ideas among<br/>
&gt; us about issues and experiences that we as individuals have had.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	So, to that end, promotion should be an individual and LOCAL choice. We<br/>
&gt; can collectively develop some helpful "aids" to share among us, perhaps<br/>
&gt; accessed only by folks on the list, but not visable to the web page<br/>
&gt; generally? These might be for downloading/modifying/printing to pass<br/>
&gt; about as we as individuals see fit? I agree with the sentiments of keep<br/>
&gt; it simple and rubber-stampish, not glitzy or "commercial".<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	There are lots of local options for promotion, many of which have been<br/>
&gt; discussed, some done. Tom Cooch has already involved a library, and some<br/>
&gt; of his students. My son and two friends want to bring it to cub scouts. <br/>
&gt; These are the sorts of activities that build local 'critical mass'. So,<br/>
&gt; as we go forward, lets share experiences such as these that have (or<br/>
&gt; haven't) worked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; About Vandalism:<br/>
&gt; 	RE: the lost Texas boxes, I think I've concluded that someone found the<br/>
&gt; first by accident, found out about the web page thru info in the box,<br/>
&gt; and went and found clues and boxes as a  result. To me, this is the only<br/>
&gt; logical conclusion. Why?<br/>
&gt;  	Julie seems to have eliminated natural (water, animals, etc.),<br/>
&gt; and, I just don't think there is a cross-country conspiracy (from the<br/>
&gt; previous missing boxes elsewhere), and no one is going to accidentally<br/>
&gt; find<br/>
&gt; three in so short a span, and, finally, three different accidental finds<br/>
&gt; by different persons in so short a span is unlikely. So, what other<br/>
&gt; conclusion is possible?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	That said, I don't feel that having clues on the net is the problem -<br/>
&gt; they have to be published someplace and, they can always be recopied and<br/>
&gt; passed along - we really cannot hope to control whose hands they get to<br/>
&gt; forever. <br/>
&gt; 	I think we each make a decision: Simple clues, easily found are more at<br/>
&gt; risk but perhaps better for boxes geared for kids. Cryptic, or long and<br/>
&gt; complicated clues, are safer, and more appealing for die-hard<br/>
&gt; letterboxers. The risk/benefit realities should be clear to each of us<br/>
&gt; by now - perhaps this is a good reason NOT to state difficulty on a web<br/>
&gt; page - a web-surfing-vandal will just grab the easy ones? <br/>
&gt; 	<br/>
&gt; 	I do think, however, that this 'issue' has consumed far more time than<br/>
&gt; is beneficial (no offense meant here, Julie). I am concerned that all<br/>
&gt; this discussion, including ways to make it more difficult, may just<br/>
&gt; serve to increase the 'problem' - sort of a self-fulfilling prophesy.<br/>
&gt; This may involve the same sort of mind that pulls fire alarms and calls<br/>
&gt; in danger scares to schools - fun to watch the results in the media, in<br/>
&gt; this case - us. It was good to talk it out, however.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Finally, I think it would be GREAT to have Adrian or Graham over here to<br/>
&gt; visit, hunt for boxes, and talk to the local schoolkids. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is far too long. Please excuse muy manners!<br/>
