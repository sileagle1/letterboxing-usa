                    <div class="plaintext-content">To all ohio boxers, there are rules to placing boxes in the state <br/>
parks and county boxes (at least in hamilton county). The Tristate <br/>
Geocachers, now called OKICachers, have been discussing this on their <br/>
message board. Apparently, you should contact the park office before <br/>
placing a cache to let the park staff that it is there and to make <br/>
sure that you are not placing the cache in a dangerous or protected <br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
in addition, no boxes or cahces are to be placed in nature preserves. <br/>
i believe that there are a few of these in hamilton county.<br/>
<br/>
the OKICachers are kind of planning to approach the hamilton county <br/>
parks as a group to show their goodwill with regard to placing good, <br/>
safe caches.  maybe the cinci letterboxers could share in this effort?<br/>
<br/>
i'm up for discussion.....<br/>
