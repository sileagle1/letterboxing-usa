I think SLO would be the perfect place to have a gathering (I've been wanting <br/>
to get down there to grab a couple dozen boxes for months!) and I think we <br/>
should definitely agree to do one there for whomever wants to attend, Nor Cal OR <br/>
So Cal. However, since I see there's a lot of interest in a SF/Sac/BayArea <br/>
gathering too, I'd like to try to plan one there. I'm familiar with the several <br/>
boxes in the east bay (Contra Costa) and that's where I grew up so I could <br/>
find a good place for a gathering. But if the consensus is to have it on the SF <br/>
side, I'm not going to be that good at finding the right spot let along knowing <br/>
the boxes over on that side of the bridge. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I'd like to plan it for September.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions please?! <br/>

I'll be in Sacramento/Rocklin the first weekend of September, so I vote for <br/>
having the gathering on Sunday, September 7th anywhere within 3 hours of <br/>
Sacramento!<br/>

P.P.S.  Thanks to the folks who suggested boxes to search out on our <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I too am extremely encouraged by the enthusiatic responses regarding a Northern California gathering.  I just returned from a visit with Amanda from Seattle because I was chomping at the bit to go letterboxing, and have almost exhausted the supply here in the Bay Area.  To give you an idea, I had 32 boxes found when I left (and many of them hard won), and I added 37 more in the span of 4 days while in the Northwest!  More than doubled my count.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I see the Bay Area as a half-way point (sort of) between the Sacramento and San Luis areas.  I also believe that a gathering is the kind of thing that is needed to give a developing area a little push to start growing even faster, which is just what we need here.  San Luis is already well established, and could certainly support a gathering of their own in addition to something up here (they are separated by 4 hours, so really two different entities in my mind).<br/>
<br/>
I too would vote for an East Bay site, primarily because that's where I've planted most of my boxes, and also I've heard that there was an article in the local Contra Costa newspaper so there are several newbies out there.  I am personally in Alameda County, right next door and we have lots of good parks here as well.  Can I be on the planning committee?  One of the places Amanda took me to was Fort Steilacoom where the Seattle gathering had taken place.  There were 20 boxes planted in one park - heavenly!  There is hardly anything in San Francisco itself or the Peninsula, so they don't seem like good candidates for the gathering.<br/>

P.S.  We can probably get Amanda down here for the gathering too!<br/>
