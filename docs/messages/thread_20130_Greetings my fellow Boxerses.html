You're supposed to clear everything you say or write with Mr Cheney or<br/>
Mr Rove. Remember? We've explained this to you many times. Try to<br/>

&gt; From the desk of<br/>
&gt; Strategerie W. Bush<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Greetings my fellow Boxerses,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I speak to you not as the alter ego of my famous counterpart, but <br/>
as a<br/>
&gt; boxer and general GPS'er.  I speak to you from my mouth and not the<br/>
&gt; mouth of others.  This is what I'm good at.  I like meeting people, <br/>
my<br/>
&gt; fellow citizens, I like interfacing with them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They misunderestimated me because I know the human being and fish <br/>
can<br/>
&gt; coexist peacefully.  That is why I know what I believe.  I will<br/>
&gt; continue to articulate what I believe and what I believe  I believe<br/>
&gt; what I believe is right.  It isn't pollution that's ruining the<br/>
&gt; environment; it's all the impurities in the air and water that's <br/>
doing<br/>
&gt; it.  Natural gas is hemispheric.  I like to call it hemispheric in<br/>
&gt; nature because it is a product that we can find in our <br/>
neighbourhoods.<br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You're free.  And freedom is beautiful.  And, you know, it'll take<br/>
&gt; time to restore chaos and order order out of chaos.  But we will.  <br/>
We<br/>
&gt; cannot let terriers and rogue nations hold this nation hostile or <br/>
hold<br/>
&gt; our allies hostile.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Families is where our nation finds hope, where wings take dream.  So<br/>
&gt; thank you for reminding me about the importance of being a good mom<br/>
&gt; and a great volunteer as well. (I was a prisoner too, but for bad<br/>
&gt; reasons.)  Rarely is the questioned asked: Is our children <br/>
learning? <br/>
&gt; I think if you know what you believe, it makes it a lot easier to<br/>
&gt; answer questions.  I can't answer your question.  They<br/>
&gt; misunderestimated me.  If you don't stand for anything, you don't<br/>
&gt; standfor anything!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We've had a great weekend here in the Land of the Enchanted.  Just<br/>
&gt; remember it's the birds that's supposed to suffer, not the hunter.  <br/>
I<br/>
&gt; propose that every city have a telephone number 119 -- for dyslexics<br/>
&gt; who have an emergency.  And so, in my State of the my State of the<br/>
&gt; Union or state my speech to the nation, whatever you want to call <br/>
it,<br/>
&gt; speech to the nation I asked Americans to give 4,000 years 4,000 <br/>
hours<br/>
&gt; over the next the rest of your life of service to America.  That's<br/>
&gt; what I asked 4,000 hours.  I have made good judgements in the <br/>
past.  I<br/>
&gt; have made good judgements in the future.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes when I sleep at night I think of "Hop on Pop."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And so in closing I say a stamp in every box and a rock for any <br/>
box. <br/>
&gt; Trees have been underestimatingly overbearing danger to wilds and<br/>
&gt; rocks much safer less fire to our wilds.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Strategerie W. Bush<br/>
&gt; The American people wants a president that  appeals to the angels.<br/>
