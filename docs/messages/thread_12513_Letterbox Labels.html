    YOU HAVE FOUND A<br/>
<br/>
       LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE DO NOT THROW AWAY<br/>
<br/>
  WWW.LETTERBOXING.ORG<br/>
<br/>
Some of my boxes are smaller than the labels--in that case, I just <br/>
write on the container using a permanent marker (such as a Sharpie <br/>
pen).<br/>
<br/>
On the inside of most of the letterboxes, I put this label:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
              If you are new to letterboxing:  <br/>
<br/>
 Letterboxing is an intriguing pastime combining map-reading skills,<br/>
 puzzle solving, outdoor adventure, artistic ability<br/>
 and delightful "treasure-hunts" in beautiful, scenic places.<br/>
<br/>
            Please sign in &amp; carefully replace the <br/>
           box where you found it (hidden from view).  <br/>
            If you do not know where it was hidden,<br/>
  please contact the owner via the info listed within the logbook.<br/>
       Look for clues to this and other letterboxes on<br/>
                  www.letterboxing.org<br/>
<br/>
Of course, they look better when you print them up in a word <br/>
processing program such as Microsoft Word--where I highlight some of <br/>
the text and use bold letters to emphasize various things.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

My mate and I plan to hide a few letterboxes this spring and summer <br/>
(following the adage, if you plant them, they will come).  We think <br/>
we might also hide a hitchhiker.  Should you post those somewhere <br/>
(not revealing the location of course)?  Or just hide it, and wait <br/>
for someone to post that they found it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the advice!<br/>

I've seen posts along the lines of "Such-and-Such HH has been released<br/>
somewhere in Such-and-Such state," but I'm sure many HH planters don't<br/>
announce at all. As with much else in this hobby, it's up to you<br/>
really.   Good luck!<br/>

You can open the pdf file and then type in the name of your letterbox<br/>

ready to go!<br/>
