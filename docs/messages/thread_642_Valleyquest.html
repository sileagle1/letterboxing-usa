I will update the FAQ and update the first in state series.  This seems to <br/>
be along the lines of my research into the claim of letterboxing being<br/>
started in this area about 10 years ago (although the earliest box on their<br/>
site appears to be dated 1997).  I will have to keep digging for the earlier<br/>
ones.<br/>
<br/>
I will pass this on to the group.<br/>

&gt; Thank you for the FAQ's.  I don't know if you know about the book put out in<br/>
&gt; Vermont, but there is a book called "Valley Quest," that has about 54 letter<br/>
&gt; boxes scattered throughout 24 communities in Vermont.  I was on vacation this<br/>
&gt; summer with my wife in Norwich Vermont, and I saw the book for sale.  I had<br/>
&gt; read last year's Smithsonian article, so I vaguely new a little about the<br/>
&gt; sport.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, we tried the first letterboxing hunt, and it was brilliant!  So,<br/>
&gt; then, every day, we would try another one.  By the end of the trip we did<br/>
&gt; three in one day!  The book is available via the organization that helped put<br/>
&gt; it together.  There web site is http://www.vitalcommunities.org/vq.htm.  I<br/>
&gt; believe that you and your fellow letterboxing fans would have a field day<br/>
&gt; exploring these clues.  And with a Vermont autumn coming up, with the trees<br/>
&gt; turning golden, and red, what a great way to see Fall colors and letterbox at<br/>
&gt; the same time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just tried an Evanston Illinois letterbox today, and it was great.  I just<br/>
&gt; wish there was more in my community.  I'll have to add a few.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks again.<br/>

I picked up a flyer on this late last summer - if it's the same group. <br/>
A number of schools in the Connecticut Valley area (VT and NH) were<br/>
working out letterbox-xtyled history learning hunts. AS this was closer<br/>
to Nisa than I, I let it drop after telling her about it.<br/>
<br/>
Nisa: Anything to share?<br/>

A very timely placement! I am planning to go to Shieling Forest next <br/>
Saturday, on my way down to (or back from) Shirley, Mass, where Erik <br/>
&amp; Susan have their two new boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Send me the clues and I'll get them right up.<br/>
<br/>
I am also trying to contact the folks at ValleyQuest, but am being <br/>
held up on several fronts by a quirky new computer.<br/>
<br/>
Tom<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I hope you and Eric can come to our letterboxing gathering in <br/>
November (5 - 7). What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Erik,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nope, nothing to report!  The person I contacted last year did not<br/>
&gt; return my email and I haven't followed up either - I have not been a<br/>
&gt; very proactive letterboxer here. :/  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a happier note, Eric and I should be getting our 2nd letterbox<br/>
&gt; (Shieling Forest #3) out tomorrow if the weather cooperates.  It's a<br/>
&gt; little cloudy here this a.m., but the sun is trying to peek through.  <br/>
