                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have had allergies to cats for as long as I can remember... but, I<br/>
have always dealt with them because I LOVE my cats... I have 3 (Bonkers<br/>
- 16; Stormy - 13; &amp; Cow - 7).  I got married in 1999 to a man who is<br/>
very allergic to cats and has asthma.  Since we were married, I have<br/>
kept the cats out of the main living area for his health. He never asked<br/>
me to do this... I did it because I hated seeing him rely so heavily on<br/>
his inhaler.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, here is the issue.  The cats current home is our basement.  Next<br/>
week we start remodeling our basement... to make it a living area (we<br/>
need the space as our family has grown since we bought the house).  This<br/>
means there is no place for the cats.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My mom has agreed to take my cats and is coming to get them next weekend<br/>
to take them to her house in CA (I live in CO).  I am having a real hard<br/>
time dealing with this and it is killing me to give up my cats.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everything I read says it is GOOD for Matthew (my 1 year old son who has<br/>
all the beginning signs of asthma) to be around the cats... it helps<br/>
build his immunity to being allergic... this is the "new" theory since<br/>
2001.  However, every article that I have found about adults w/ asthma<br/>
(and an allergy to cats) says that they should NOT be around cats...<br/>
that they are 50% more likely to end up in the hospital w/ a major<br/>
asthma attack.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sooooo - I am in the process of trying making Stormy non-allergenic...<br/>
LOL  I am wiping him down with a cleaner per the directions to help w/<br/>
dander control... I am brushing him daily to help w/ shedding and also<br/>
TRYING to give him anti-shedding pills (He doesn't like them).  I talked<br/>
to the vet tech last night who said there is also a proven drug (it's a<br/>
tranquilizer that is diluted 100 times) that will change the ph in the<br/>
saliva so that it is also non-allergenic.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
However, I know Michael's other concerns are the mess and smell of the<br/>
cats... I suggested putting the litter box in the unfinished area of the<br/>
basement with a cat door in the wall... this would keep the litter and<br/>
most of the smell inside the unfinished area... but, he is still<br/>
concerned about hairballs ( Stormy is notorious for  throwing up all the<br/>
time - hairballs or not) and that will stain/ruin the new carpet.  And,<br/>
Stormy is also a scooter... his anal glands don't empty correctly when<br/>
he has bowl movements, so to help the irritation, he scoots his bottom<br/>
on the floor - this streaks carpet. (Sorry, I am sure that is more than<br/>
you wanted to know! LOL)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know I can't keep all 3 cats... but, I am really having a hard time<br/>
with the idea of giving up Stormy.  Of course, every time I bring this<br/>
up, Michael changes the subject.  I understand it is a medical issue<br/>
with him and that his health has to come first (of course, his mother is<br/>
NO help... she keeps reminding him how an asthma attack could kill<br/>
him)... but this is still just killing me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So - here is what I am asking of all of you.  Can anyone here recommend<br/>
a PROVEN way to make Stormy non-allergenic and stop his throwing up and<br/>
scooting???  Money is really tight, so I am on a very strict budget...<br/>
but, I want to keep my babies!  Any suggestions, help, etc would be very<br/>
much appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PS - my cats are indoor animals - they do not go outside and I refuse to<br/>
make them outdoor cats (we have bears and foxes that come down at<br/>
night).<br/>

<br/>
I lead the cat project for the local 4H clubs in my area, and it never<br/>
fails, every year, the question about cat allergies comes up at the first<br/>
meeting. Basically, cat allergies come from one of two areas - dander or<br/>
oils. My own dh is allergic to the oils in their coat and saliva, I am<br/>
allergic to the dander in their coats.<br/>
<br/>
Both oil and dander can be remedied by giving the cat a full bath weekly.<br/>
Not brushing them down with a dry bath solution, but taking the kitty into a<br/>
tub and washing them like you would a dog. I suggest wearing long sleeves<br/>
the first few times :) The bath washes away the oils and dander - head and<br/>
shoulders shampoo or a good baby shampoo work best, no they don't need<br/>
conditioning rinse after.<br/>
<br/>
The throwing up is something our own 16yo cat had when we first got him.<br/>
Petramalt works wonders. Give them a 1" strip daily and within a week, the<br/>
majority of vomiting issues will go away. For the rest, try to determine if<br/>
it is related to eating or drinking. Some cats eat too fast and vomit up<br/>
some food right after eating (one of our girls does that at times). Some<br/>
drink too much water and the same thing happens.<br/>
<br/>
And last, but certainly not least - scooting. Annoying habit, isn't it?<br/>
Especially when they scoot just enough to stain the carpet /then/ wash<br/>
themselves. Give him a scoot spot. You can't cure the scooting, but if he<br/>
has a piece of carpet right near his box, between the box and wherever he'd<br/>
go to leave the room it is in, he won't miss it. You also should look into<br/>
the anti-pet spray stuff they use to keep boys from spraying. Mist a little<br/>
on the carpet near the cat box area and it should keep him away.<br/>
<br/>
However, a cat will inevitably stain carpet, no matter how good they are. My<br/>
dh swears by Resolve spray-on carpet cleaner. It's gotten even the worst<br/>
animal and child stains out of our light gray carpet. And the child leaves<br/>
far worse stains then the cats :)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;PS - my cats are indoor animals - they do not go outside and I refuse to<br/>
&gt;make them outdoor cats (we have bears and foxes that come down at<br/>
&gt;night).<br/>
<br/>
Good for you! Indoor cats lose their ability to thrive outside, plus far too<br/>
many cats lose their lives out of doors very quickly. Add to it them huge<br/>
impact feral and outdoor cats have on native small animal populations (birds<br/>
and mice take the biggest hits), and it's bad idea to let any domesticated<br/>
animal loose on the environment.<br/>

&gt; However, I know Michael's other concerns are the mess and smell of<br/>
&gt;the &gt; cats... <br/>
<br/>
The best kitty litter I have ever used is called "Feline Pine" it has<br/>
NO DUST and is silica dust free, it does not stink like the other<br/>
litters.  It's made from recycled wood and looks like pellets.  It is<br/>
 environmentally compatible, all natural, biodegradable, and chemical<br/>
free.  It runs about $13.00 /20# but will last for a long long time.<br/>
No airborne dust, perfume, stink. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 he is still<br/>
&gt; concerned about hairballs ( Stormy is notorious for  throwing up<br/>
all the<br/>
&gt; time - hairballs or not)   <br/>
<br/>
Our cats eat Purina cat chow for hairball control.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;and that will stain/ruin the new carpet.<br/>
<br/>
A wonderful, lifesaving product called "Simple Solution" at $13.99 a<br/>
gallon has enzymes in it that actually eat the urine, feces, vomit and<br/>
also has detergent in it to clean up the rest of the mess.  It smells<br/>
nice too.  Works on cats, dogs and people too!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----- ALERT --- THE FOLLOWING MAY BE TOO GRAPHIC FOR SOME READERS --<br/>
-----------SKIP THIS SECTION--------------------------<br/>
<br/>
And,<br/>
&gt; Stormy is also a scooter... his anal glands don't empty correctly<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; he has bowl movements, so to help the irritation, he scoots his<br/>
bottom<br/>
&gt; on the floor - this streaks carpet. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe your vet will show you how to empty his glands, or is it<br/>
possible that he needs some extra moisture / oil in his diet and the<br/>
problem is that he needed some TP? Some Petromalt or Petrolax or<br/>
another laxative given in small doses every day or every other day<br/>
might help.  We had a little guy who had this problem and just a<br/>
little dab every morning did the trick.<br/>
<br/>
----SAFE READING NOW-------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
This is heartbreaking having to choose and I hope it goes well for<br/>
you.  The feline pine seems expensive at first glance but the other<br/>
litters are used up so fast that in actual use over the course of a<br/>
month, the feline pine is actually a money saver.  I buy it and the<br/>
Simple Solution at PetCo.  <br/>
<br/>
One more thought, the kittie I refered to who was a bottom scooter, he<br/>
also did a lot of vomiting.  I noticed that his behavior was similiar<br/>
to mine I have GERD (acid reflux disease) where he abruptly sits<br/>
upright and starts licking his lips which is sometimes following by<br/>
vomiting. I talked it over with the<br/>
vet and she told me to give him 1/4 tab of Pepcid AC every day (I<br/>
pulverized it and mixed it in with some catfood). The problem vanished<br/>
and only came back when I missed a dose.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I consider myself fortunate in that my Mother-In-Law is allergic to cats and<br/>
I have three...hehehehe....   A VERY viable excuse to not invite the in-laws<br/>
over! ( Trust me, we don't get along and the cats are a wonderful reason to<br/>
keep distance)<br/>
<br/>
Some suggestions:<br/>
<br/>
1) Acepromazine and water mix does work wonders for cat allergies. In my<br/>
years as a vet tech many of our clients swore by it and were religious in<br/>
dosing their cats with it. I can't say the cats were probably that happy<br/>
about it, but it makes many situations livable.<br/>
<br/>
2) Frequent bathing and brushing can help, as well as regular through<br/>
cleaning and vacuuming. Be sure to get baseboards and crevices as these are<br/>
areas prone to catch hair and dander. When bathing and brushing the cats, be<br/>
sure to brush thoroughly first so as to loosen all the dead hair and dander,<br/>
then wash the cat with a pet shampoo formulated specifically for allergy<br/>
reduction in cats. ( Cats are VERY sensitive to many ingredients and some<br/>
products could be very toxic, especially since cats lick their hair to groom<br/>
themselves) There are many products available, so feel free to ask your vet<br/>
for recommendations. Many of the pet catalogs carry these products at<br/>
reduced prices, so be sure to shop around.<br/>
<br/>
3) As far as vomiting goes, try adding a hairball supplement to the cat's<br/>
daily diet. Again, there are several available and most are accepted fairly<br/>
well. Most require a daily dose of 3/4-1 inch of the paste like gel and if<br/>
the cat doesn't like it right off your finger, try smearing it on the cat's<br/>
front leg. Most (not all though) cats will clean it off as part of cleaning<br/>
themselves and even if they aren't attracted to the taste, will lick it off<br/>
to keep clean. If you do get rug stains from kitty vomit, try using Resolve<br/>
or Bissell rug cleaner for Pet Stains to clean the area. Personally, I like<br/>
the Bissell rug cleaner for Pets since I can mix it up with water in a spray<br/>
bottle and it goes a long way cost-wise. It works great for all kinds of<br/>
stains.<br/>
<br/>
4) For scooting, have the vet teach you how to empty anal glands. It really<br/>
isn't that hard, although I can't say that it is pleasant..LOL.  Also, try<br/>
increasing the fiber in the cat's diet to help naturally express the glands<br/>
with each bowel movement. Usually feeding only dry food with a higher fiber<br/>
content helps keep stools firm and helps with this issue. Be sure and<br/>
eliminate can food, milk products and the like, which all tend to promote<br/>
soft stool....and smelly stools too!<br/>
<br/>
5) If after trying everything possible and these issues are still a problem,<br/>
consider investing in a cat cage. There are some really nice ones available<br/>
for about $125 or so and they work really well. I bought one 5 years ago for<br/>
my 18 yr old cat with kidney failure and it was a lifesaver! Unfortunately,<br/>
a side effect of his failing kidneys was uncontrollable urination and it<br/>
just wasn't possible to have him loose in the house. I bought the cage in<br/>
hopes of confining him near a litter box and it honestly was a miracle. He<br/>
had the double decker size which included 2 fuzzy fleece covered shelves and<br/>
a plastic bottom pan on caster wheels. There was plenty of room for a litter<br/>
pan and a blanket, etc., and it was wonderfully simple to clean. We kept him<br/>
confined to the cage at night and when we couldn't supervise him, but had<br/>
him out with us when we sat down for the evening, or when we were doing<br/>
something close by. He did very well with the new routine and it bought him<br/>
an extra 2 years of life with us before his kidney failure finally took him.<br/>
<br/>
6) Has your husband entertained the idea of allergy testing and treatment?<br/>
If he is prone to such severe attacks, I am sure there may be other causes<br/>
and allergens that may be problems for him. A good friend of mine was in a<br/>
similar situation and has had tremendous relief from going through allergy<br/>
testing and serum injections. She is down to a serum injection one a month<br/>
now and is finally able to enjoy life while breathing at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps =)))<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
