                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK - we couldn't resist.  We were so excited that franzsolo planted <br/>
some boxes nearby for us to find we ran right out after church this <br/>
evening and found Political Graveyard.  Cool stamp!  I hope I can be <br/>
half that good a carver some day!  We resisted the temptation to rush <br/>
out and grab them all - we have to have something to look forward to <br/>
when we've got the itch and don't have time to drive an hour or more <br/>
to find some.  How about some of the rest of you talented people <br/>
wandering down this way and planting some?  We're trying to get <br/>
enough planted out there to make it worth your time!  Happy boxing to <br/>
all!<br/>

couldn't resist going after another one of franzsolo's boxes he left <br/>
close to home for us.  We located Shady Hollow - another beautiful <br/>
stamp - and then planted Ridgewood Flower in the area.  We also <br/>
checked on a couple of our boxes in the area and found that Wanda <br/>
from R.I. had been first finder on both of them!  She really gets <br/>
around!  A great end to a wonderful Lord's Day!<br/>
