I found the Riverside box placed by Pico this past week. the box was <br/>
there but very wet. the ink from the pad has spread, but <br/>
fortunately, the log book and stamp were ok.  with the recent <br/>
flooding it was a miracle that the box was still there!  <br/>
<br/>
thanks pico.  i wasn't prepared to box that week so i simply signed <br/>
the log.  didn't even get to collect the stamp! oh well. it was fun <br/>
anyway.<br/>
