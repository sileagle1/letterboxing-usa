Scottsburg, Virginia on January 12, 2003, by mlgainey. Scottsburg is<br/>
in Halifax County, and the closest major metropolitan area is South<br/>
Boston.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Crappie Box<br/>
<br/>
Take either section of Captain Staunton's Trail.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the Captain's trail, turn left onto the River Bank<br/>
Trail.<br/>
<br/>
Very shortly, you will see a stump on your right at 350 degrees. It<br/>
will be near a tree with a place on it that resembles what you sit on!<br/>
<br/>
The box is in this stump covered with leaves and bark. Please rehide<br/>
completely.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful because there is a steep dropoff into the Dan River on the<br/>
other side of this stump.<br/>
<br/>
If you walk as far as the section of the River Bank Trail with several<br/>
fallen logs on either side of it, you've gone too far.<br/>
<br/>
If desired, continue on the River Bank Trail for a long, long time to<br/>
reach the Loblolly box. Or go back to the beginning of Captain<br/>
Staunton's Trail and head over to the pool, the tennis courts, and the<br/>
playground.<br/>
