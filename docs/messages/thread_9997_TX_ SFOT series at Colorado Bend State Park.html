Beautiful Texas hill country and a great hike.  It's within about an <br/>
hour and a half of Austin and an hour from Fort Hood/Killeen.  Enjoy!<br/>

Six Flags Over Texas Series<br/>
Colorado Bend State Park<br/>
Bend, TX<br/>
San Saba County<br/>
Placed: 29 Dec 02<br/>
Placed by: Armyswmr99<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Medium<br/>
Time: 2 hours<br/>
Distance: About 4 miles of open Texas hill country<br/>
<br/>
Colorado Bend State Park is located about an hour and a half <br/>
northwest of Austin.  From Austin, take US 183 to Lampasas. (If you <br/>
are coming from the Killeen/FT Hood area, take US 190 to Lampasas.  <br/>
Turn right when you come to the stop light in Lampasas, towards US <br/>
183.)  When in Lampasas, look for the sign to FM 580 and turn left. <br/>
Continue on FM 580 until you enter Bend.  Follow the signs to <br/>
Colorado Bend SP left. You will cross a cattle guard and begin <br/>
driving on a private road.  Continue cautiously, as cows graze freely <br/>
between here and the park entrance.  Drive approximately 5.1 miles <br/>
from the cattle guard to the trailhead marked "The Windmill Trail."  <br/>
About a .25 mile prior to the trailhead, you will enter the park and <br/>
pass a small house on the right.<br/>
<br/>
Begin at the trailhead to "The Windmill Trail."<br/>
<br/>
"SFOT #1"<br/>
Start at the trailhead and follow the blue/yellow arrow trail <br/>
markers.  In about 100 yards, the trail forks. Follow the blue/yellow <br/>
arrow trail markers left.  Approximately .5 mile you will walk <br/>
through a tunnel of trees followed by an open field with a lone tree <br/>
in the middle of the field to the right.  Stand at the base of the <br/>
lone tree.  190 degrees from the tree, at about 25 feet is a small <br/>
tree.  The letterbox is at the base under a rockpile.<br/>
<br/>
"SFOT #2"<br/>
Continue on the trail in the same direction.  Follow the blue arrow <br/>
trail marker left.  From that trail marker, walk up the trail <br/>
approximately 100 meters and you will see a large rock on the right <br/>
at a tree.  Continue walking20 meters to a large rock in the middle <br/>
of the trail.  Stand on the rock.  At 290 degrees, look for a clump <br/>
of trees.  At the base of the trees, on the side opposite the trail, <br/>
look under a rock pile and you will find "SFOT #2."<br/>
<br/>
"SFOT #3"<br/>
Continue on the trail.  Stand at the next blue arrow straight trail <br/>
marker you come to.  At 285 degrees, at approximately 30 meters there <br/>
will be a clump of 3 small trees surrounded by rocks.  Look on the <br/>
W/NW side in a small bush under a small rock.  "SFOT #3."<br/>
<br/>
"SFOT #4"<br/>
Continue on the path.  At the next trail marker, you will be at a <br/>
fork in the road (there are also rock cairns there to mark the <br/>
path.).  Take the path that cuts sharply back to the left. (If you <br/>
are short on time and want to skip boxes 4 &amp; 5, you can take the path <br/>
to the right.  It will take you to the campground, from there, take a <br/>
right and it will take you back to the trailhead, while passing #6).  <br/>
At about .25 mile, you will see a steel water tank on the left of the <br/>
trail.  Standing at the tank, at 275 degrees walk 15 meters to a <br/>
clump of 3 trees.  Behind the tree closest to the trail, in the <br/>
bushes you will find "SFOT #4."<br/>
<br/>
"SFOT #5"<br/>
Continue on the path.  Stand at the next yellow arrow trail marker.  <br/>
At 235 degrees, see the lone Juniper tree at 20 meters.  At its base, <br/>
under a rock pile, you will find "SFOT #5."<br/>
<br/>
"SFOT #6"<br/>
Continue on the path.  At the T-junction, turn right (two yellow <br/>
arrow trail marker).  You will pass the "Primitive Campground" and <br/>
then the windmill and well.  At the 2nd "Primitive Campground" signs <br/>
and blue/yellow arrow trail marker, take the path to the left.  <br/>
Follow the blue arrow trail markers straight, and then right.  Follow <br/>
the blue arrow left.  You will pass a trail marker across from a <br/>
fence and then walk up a hill.  Continue on the path until you return <br/>
to the initial fork in the trail.  Stand at the trail marker. At 285 <br/>
degrees, 20 meters see the Juniper tree base split into 4 <br/>
trees.  "SFOT #6" is in the split of the tree under rocks.<br/>
<br/>
Continue to the end of the trail.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, the more letter boxes in Central Texas the better!!!  Because <br/>
the 2 Six Flags over Texas Series are different (one is all in one <br/>
park and the other is going to be in different locations around the <br/>
state), I'm sure both will be fun!!!<br/>
<br/>
I'm just getting started in letterboxing.  Did my first 2 letterboxes <br/>
on New Year's Eve in Austin at the Barton Creek Green Belt.  <br/>
<br/>
Since I'm out in the Hill Country west of Austin, I'm planning on <br/>
planting boxes out this direction.  I went out to a couple of parks <br/>
today to scope good places to plant.  I'm thinking of doing a <br/>
Highland Lakes Series.  I just can't find a public park on Lake LBJ <br/>
yet.  But I'm sure I'll come up with something.  Also, I'm thinking <br/>
of doing a Texas Wild Flower Series.  I'm hoping to plant my first <br/>
box in one or both of these Series sometime this month.<br/>

Great minds think alike!  I need to get out your way and collect the <br/>

By the way, I just planted 2 more of the Flag series and 2 more of my <br/>

We're the Mattke Family. If you LB in Central TX you've probably seen <br/>
our stamp. <br/>
<br/>
We, too are thrilled to see LB activity picking up in the area. There <br/>
are some fantastic sites here just perfect for hiking &amp; <br/>
stashing/finding boxes- not to mention a wealth of creative, talented <br/>
folks to make and hide them.<br/>
<br/>
We were a little confused by the two "Six Flags" series- at<br/>
first <br/>
thinking they were one in the same... however, we soon sussed out the <br/>
differences and this weekend we became the first to find and stamp <br/>
all six in the Colorado Bend series.<br/>
<br/>
We were also the first to plunder Silver Eagle's Austin flag box and <br/>
we have left room in our journal for the other five flags which we'll <br/>
collect over the coming months as we visit each region of the state <br/>
(terrific concept, BTW).<br/>
<br/>
Both SFOT series are different enough in nature and we're sure folks <br/>
will enjoy both for the unique characteristics, challenges, <br/>
collectability and appeal that each one offers.<br/>
<br/>
Kudos to Silver Eagle and to Armyswmr99 for sharing some very <br/>
entertaining and enjoyable boxes with the community!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone considering adding these to their collection of Texas LB <br/>
stamps will not be disappointed with the quality of the hunt, or the <br/>
stamps themselves which are brilliant.<br/>
<br/>
Look for boxes from the Mattke Family coming soon. They won't be easy <br/>
to find- you'll need to work out some brain cells to even know where <br/>
to look, but the clues should be fun to solve and we hope, the boxes <br/>
will be a joy to find.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>
-just Drew, and the Mattke Family<br/>

&gt; &gt; through a tunnel of trees followed by an open field with a lone <br/>
&gt; tree <br/>
&gt; &gt; in the middle of the field to the right.  Stand at the base of <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; lone tree.  190 degrees from the tree, at about 25 feet is a <br/>
small <br/>
&gt; &gt; tree.  The letterbox is at the base under a rockpile.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "SFOT #2"<br/>
&gt; &gt; Continue on the trail in the same direction.  Follow the blue <br/>
arrow <br/>
&gt; &gt; trail marker left.  From that trail marker, walk up the trail <br/>
&gt; &gt; approximately 100 meters and you will see a large rock on the <br/>
right <br/>
&gt; &gt; at a tree.  Continue walking20 meters to a large rock in the <br/>
middle <br/>
&gt; &gt; of the trail.  Stand on the rock.  At 290 degrees, look for a <br/>
clump <br/>
&gt; &gt; of trees.  At the base of the trees, on the side opposite the <br/>
&gt; trail, <br/>
&gt; &gt; look under a rock pile and you will find "SFOT #2."<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "SFOT #3"<br/>
&gt; &gt; Continue on the trail.  Stand at the next blue arrow straight <br/>
trail <br/>
&gt; &gt; marker you come to.  At 285 degrees, at approximately 30 meters <br/>
&gt; there <br/>
&gt; &gt; will be a clump of 3 small trees surrounded by rocks.  Look on <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; W/NW side in a small bush under a small rock.  "SFOT #3."<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "SFOT #4"<br/>
&gt; &gt; Continue on the path.  At the next trail marker, you will be at a <br/>
&gt; &gt; fork in the road (there are also rock cairns there to mark the <br/>
&gt; &gt; path.).  Take the path that cuts sharply back to the left. (If <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; &gt; are short on time and want to skip boxes 4 &amp; 5, you can take the <br/>
&gt; path <br/>
&gt; &gt; to the right.  It will take you to the campground, from there, <br/>
take <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; right and it will take you back to the trailhead, while passing <br/>
&gt; #6).  <br/>
&gt; &gt; At about .25 mile, you will see a steel water tank on the left of <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; trail.  Standing at the tank, at 275 degrees walk 15 meters to a <br/>
&gt; &gt; clump of 3 trees.  Behind the tree closest to the trail, in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; bushes you will find "SFOT #4."<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "SFOT #5"<br/>
&gt; &gt; Continue on the path.  Stand at the next yellow arrow trail <br/>
&gt; marker.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; At 235 degrees, see the lone Juniper tree at 20 meters.  At its <br/>
&gt; base, <br/>
&gt; &gt; under a rock pile, you will find "SFOT #5."<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "SFOT #6"<br/>
&gt; &gt; Continue on the path.  At the T-junction, turn right (two yellow <br/>
&gt; &gt; arrow trail marker).  You will pass the "Primitive Campground" <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; then the windmill and well.  At the 2nd "Primitive Campground" <br/>
&gt; signs <br/>
&gt; &gt; and blue/yellow arrow trail marker, take the path to the left.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Follow the blue arrow trail markers straight, and then right.  <br/>
&gt; Follow <br/>
&gt; &gt; the blue arrow left.  You will pass a trail marker across from a <br/>
&gt; &gt; fence and then walk up a hill.  Continue on the path until you <br/>
&gt; return <br/>
&gt; &gt; to the initial fork in the trail.  Stand at the trail marker. At <br/>
&gt; 285 <br/>
&gt; &gt; degrees, 20 meters see the Juniper tree base split into 4 <br/>
&gt; &gt; trees.  "SFOT #6" is in the split of the tree under rocks.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Continue to the end of the trail.<br/>
