kids.  We were out today for our second and third finds and we placed <br/>
our very first box.  The boys are as excited to see who finds our box <br/>
as they are to have found some.<br/>
<br/>
It was especially fun to flip through the log books and see stamps <br/>
belonging to people we "recognize" from the website.<br/>
