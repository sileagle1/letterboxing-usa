Museum in South Pierce County  and was first to nab the Beaver <br/>
Quarter Letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
The DuPont Museum which offers FREE ADMISSION is only <br/>
open on Sunday afternoons from 1-4 pm but is well worth the <br/>
stop if you happen to be in the area on a Sunday afternoon.  <br/>
<br/>
The museum is full of very interesting displays showing the <br/>
history of this very important site, the first European settlement <br/>
on Puget Sound at Fort Nisqually.  There are many interesting <br/>
artifacts, displays and photos.  The museum staff is also very <br/>
helpful with intimate knowledge of the area's history.  <br/>
<br/>
The letterbox is hidden within the museum itself and is <br/>
sponsored by the museum director.  DVN2R CKR and family did <br/>
a wonderful job of working this cooperative arangement out.  The <br/>
clues require studying the various displays and artifacts in order <br/>
to solve the clue puzzle. <br/>
<br/>
Be sure to visit this great Museum and Letterbox and dont be <br/>
surprised to meet other letterboxers here due to the limited <br/>
hours. Perhaps you can increase your X count in the bargain.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun, <br/>
Nail Family<br/>
