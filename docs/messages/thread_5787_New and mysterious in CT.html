<br/>
First Thirds, Second Fourths<br/>
Eric can take heart that something in man keeps us searching. Cave <br/>
people and the cliff dwellers to the east could find these. Facing <br/>
toward the right opening in the big wall, look for tree hugging <br/>
hunters among the beech.<br/>
<br/>
Then Fifths:<br/>
The Ram and the coyote climb high up the cliff and take in views from <br/>
horizon to the sun's fire. Knowing that the Ram's ring of power is <br/>
found thirty degrees west and twenty steps beyond, coyote can look <br/>
east. Howling at the moon to call Ram, the coyote rounded the corner <br/>
to the boulder.<br/>
<br/>
And Sixths:<br/>
"Howling," thought Eric? "A coyote's snout in the air? These are <br/>
points to help me find happiness? It must be easier to figure out!"<br/>
<br/>
Upstream:<br/>
It is. From Eric the Ram's hidden letterbox The Books, "an <br/>
interesting geologic formation," upstream between the third and <br/>
fourth cascades, lives a rocky island. At the topmost point, between <br/>
fallen forks, find bonus treasure.<br/>
<br/>
Uphill:<br/>
At the top of the hill scramble above The Books, before "the smaller <br/>
path leading toward the sound of running water" drops down, a rocky <br/>
knoll lives to the southwest. The best bushwack up is to the left. <br/>
Again, look at the topmost point, in the north base of a big oak.<br/>
<br/>
You can also find these clues on our website at:<br/>

<br/>
Enjoy! (And thanks to Eric the Ram).<br/>

<div>Have fun in Saratoga Springs.  My dad
