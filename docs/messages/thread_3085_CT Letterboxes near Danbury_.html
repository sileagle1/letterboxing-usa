as far as letterboxes go. The Mile of Ledges hike is well worth the <br/>
time to drive to Burlington/Bristol (maybe 1/2 to 3/4 hour+- from <br/>
Danbury?) this natural landscape is "very Connecticut." The Fish Head <br/>
series &amp; Thrill Ride aren't far from Mile of Ledges.<br/>
<br/>
We've had an eye on a few parks 'out west,'(CT) but haven't had the <br/>
chance to pursue them yet. If you'd like to plant a box, I'd be happy <br/>
to check into it once in a while and mail you back it's logbook <br/>
whenever it gets full. :)<br/>
