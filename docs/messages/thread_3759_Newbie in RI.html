I am newbie here in RI, and definitly hooked.  My friend in VA sent <br/>
me the website to check out, then convinced me to carve a stamp..and <br/>
after finding the Drew Clan boxes in Colt State Park, I was hooked.  <br/>
What a great way to spend the beautiful fall days, and I can't wait <br/>
to look this winter (I like hiking in the cooler weather, too).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who has been so busy planting in the NE area. Now <br/>
if I could just come up with a good place to plant a few ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Thanksgiving!!<br/>
