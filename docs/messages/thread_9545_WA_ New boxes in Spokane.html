I recently visited my hometown of Spokane while between jobs.  We all made<br/>
fun of it growing up, but the longer I hadn't visited the better a place it<br/>
seemed.  Such are home towns, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
I showed my mom my carving tools one Sunday afternoon, since she does a bit<br/>
of stamping herself to make greeting cards and the like.  She never got into<br/>
carving though.  Then my siblings and I went to visit the local game store.<br/>
When we got back, my mom had turned out a couple really nice stamps.  So I<br/>
put one in a box and made a couple more for the series (so she could keep the<br/>
other fruits of her labor for herself).  I'll leave it to you all to guess<br/>
which one is by my mom, and which are the products of my clumsy hacking.<br/>
<br/>
Manito Park Series<br/>
Spokane, WA<br/>
<br/>
To the park from I-90<br/>
East Bound:<br/>
Division Street exit, turn right on Division and go to 7th turn right. You<br/>
will merge with traffic that has come up the hill then turn left on<br/>
McClellan, go two blocks (2nd light) and turn left on 9th and go up hill on<br/>
Grand. Go through light at 14th to approximately 18th where you will turn<br/>
right into the Manito Park Parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
East Bound (alternate):<br/>
Take Maple Street Exit and turn right on Maple to go up the hill. It will<br/>
curve into Cedar and then turn left on 14th Ave. Go east until you reach<br/>
Grand and turn right on Grand. Go to approximately 18th where you will turn<br/>
right into the Manito Park Parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
West Bound:<br/>
Take Lincoln Street Exit across 3rd Ave to 2nd Ave and turn left. Go one<br/>
block to Monroe and turn left, go back under freeway and up hill to 14th Ave<br/>
and turn left. Go east until you reach Grand and turn right on Grand. Go to<br/>
approximately 18th where you will turn right into the Manito Park Parking<br/>
lot.<br/>
<br/>
West Bound (alternate):<br/>
Take Division St. Exit across 3rd Ave and turn left on 2nd. Go one block and<br/>
turn left on Brown. Cross under the freeway and up hill. Arterial will turn<br/>
right on 7th and then left on McClellan. Go two blocks (2nd light) and turn<br/>
left on 9th and go up hill on Grand. Go through light at 14th to<br/>
approximately 18th where you will turn right into the Manito Park Parking<br/>
lot.<br/>
<br/>
Manito is a very manicured park, as far as Washington goes, so hiding spots<br/>
were a bit hard to find.  As a result, they're a bit out of the way.  Sorry.<br/>
Also, Manito is heavily used in the warmer months.  I hope the boxes don't<br/>
get accidentally discovered.<br/>
