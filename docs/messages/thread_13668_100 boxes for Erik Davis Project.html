                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ned and I had the privilege of meeting The Vermont Viking (along with <br/>
his lovely partner Susan and their son Ben) a few years ago at the <br/>
Inn at Long Trail over some beers and conversation. The man Lives and <br/>
Breathes Letterboxing in a way that is absolutely inspiring. As one <br/>
of the first to recognize the fun in the Smithsonian article, Erik <br/>
was deeply involved in starting LbNA. He and Susan have worked <br/>
closely with all the changes since, offering guidance and <br/>
inspiration. His vision is one of the primary reasons LbNA is so <br/>
fiercly non-commercial.<br/>
<br/>
Being a bit isolated in the far north of Vermont, Erik was never a <br/>
high PFXer. Now he is unable to persue letterboxing but is still an <br/>
avid 'boxer. We would like to do something about that X count to show <br/>
him our support and well wishes. We just finished making up a bound <br/>
book (our first!) of personal stamps and best wishes for Erik and his <br/>
wonderful family. Please, everyone, take a few minutes and pop a card <br/>
with your personal stamps in the mail to:<br/>

activity so much fun. <br/>
     Now I have a real challenge. Finding my letterboxing box amongst <br/>
all my moving boxes. My stamps will be on their way soon. <br/>
     Question, since it involves letterboxing and I must find my box <br/>
of stamps does it count as a find? :-)<br/>
