                    <div class="plaintext-content">Robin, I think the problem lies in the fact that egroups and OneList<br/>
recently merged.  I belong to several egroups, and about a week ago, when I<br/>
went to the "my groups" page (which I had bookmarked), I had to<br/>
re-register, sending them my email address and a new password.  Seconds<br/>
later they emailed me a new authorization, and then I was able to get back<br/>
into the pages for my groups.<br/>
<br/>
So, you may need to re-register, but it only takes a minute.<br/>

<br/>
I know I'm not supposed to reply to the note talking about the poll, but the<br/>
e-groups polling gives me a big Oops! like I'm not set up yet or something,<br/>
so I cannot vote that way.  Count me in for 5 patches.  Maybe more later,<br/>
but so far, I know I will be ordering that many.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

<br/>
I have seen a very clever log book done with index cards, too!  One of the boxes I found had a very nicely assembled and bound index card journal, with a wonderfully decorated cover.  Would it be a breach of protocol for me to reveal the box location or person who planted it?  Just in case it is, I'll remain mum.  But, let me know if it's acceptable, and I can post back to the list.  I'd like to give that person credit for their work!<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that journal got my creative thoughts flowing on how I might be able to incorporate a different style journal into one of my next boxes.  As a letterbox seeker, I like when the journal can open "flat" to the page I need to stamp onto, without having to struggle to try to keep the previous pages from "flapping over" while I'm trying to stamp.  From that standpoint, the wire-bound journals are nice.  I'm thinking of ways to bind my own journal, but still incorporate this feature.<br/>

<br/>
Letterboxing and geocaching share some<br/>
similarities and some people combine the<br/>
two into one box. Based on my<br/>
experience, I would <br/>
<br/>
  o always combine the two if I can <br/>
  o never combine the two I can <br/>
  o only combine them in well-traveled places <br/>
  o only combine them in seldom-travelled places <br/>

If I happened to find one that did not have a stamp or logbook, I would note that I had come across it. If a letterbox was listed as a hybrid, I might look for it, if the clues stated it had a logbook and stamp as well as cache contents. In that regard, I would treat it as a letterbox find. I would not take or leave anything but stamp in as I normally would in a letterbox.

</p><p>I can understand the reason for  for hybrids in other parts of the country where letterboxes are few and far between.Combining them in that scenario is a win-win for everyone as long as both activities are honored...stamp, logbook, cache contents. For families who take their children, I suppose a hybrid box anywhere could be fun for the kids. Reasonably, though not my personal preference, there is probably room for hybrids that would cover the interests of more people in more places.

how you will go about trying to combine both sports? <br/>
<br/>
If so, then in my opinion the best method is to just plant some boxes <br/>
that are letterboxes and some that are hybrids. And wait and see what <br/>
happens.<br/>
<br/>
I planted one box that was a hybrid, and was very surprise to find <br/>
some Geocachers who had stamped in with really awesome stamps. These <br/>
people have never posted or planted a letterbox in the S.F. Bay Area <br/>
that I know of.<br/>
<br/>
 As to stamps being removed, it even happens to letterboxes. <br/>
Recently, people have posted that the box was there but the stamp had <br/>
vanished.<br/>

SUBJECT:  Great Lakes Letterbox <br/>
Gathering - LOCATION.  As the area <br/>
included in this gathering is large, <br/>
choosing a location convenient for <br/>
everyone will be difficult.  People <br/>
from the following areas have expressed <br/>
a desire to attend:  Chicago, <br/>
Cleveland, West Michigan, East <br/>
Michigan, SE Michigan, Central <br/>
Michigan.  There are two routes to go <br/>
with this...  FIRST, attempt to choose <br/>
a central location in the area of <br/>
Jackson/Ann Arbor, which would be <br/>
approximately 3.5 hours from the <br/>
outermost areas.  SECOND, assuming this <br/>
will become an annual event, take turns <br/>
holding the meet in different regions, <br/>
which would in some years shorten the <br/>
drive for some (and possibly make <br/>
attendance more feasible), and in other <br/>
years, increase the drive.  The latter <br/>
option has the advantage of making the <br/>
location more convenient for the event <br/>
coordinator as far as getting things <br/>
lined up and boxes planted, etc., and <br/>
would also give people the opportunity <br/>
to explore a variety of different <br/>
places.  From the choices below, please <br/>
indicate your preference as to location: <br/>
<br/>
  o Choose a location central to those interested in attending <br/>
  o Alternate locations throughout different regions <br/>
  o I would attempt to come either way, provided camping/lodging were available nearby <br/>

Gathering - DATE.  In considering a <br/>
potential date for the get-together, <br/>
several factors came into play.  Many <br/>
people expressed the desire to be able <br/>
to camp, which would necessitate <br/>
waiting until very late spring.  I am <br/>
not sure what the preference is as to <br/>
Saturday or Sunday.  My personal <br/>
thoughts are that holding the meet on a <br/>
Saturday would allow people an extra <br/>
day (Sunday) to independently continue <br/>
to hunt for the event boxes.  Please <br/>
indicate below the date(s) you would be <br/>
able to attend (choose as many as <br/>
apply): <br/>
<br/>
  o Saturday, April 26 <br/>
  o Sunday, April 27 <br/>
  o Saturday, May 3 <br/>
  o Sunday, May 4 <br/>
  o Saturday, May 17 <br/>
  o Sunday, May 18 <br/>
  o Saturday, May 31 <br/>
  o Sunday, June 1 <br/>
  o I cannot attend on a Saturday <br/>

<div><span class="500512815-03022003">I'm 
not from your area, but I'd probably make a point to come there at some point 
just to do letterboxing from my kayak. I'm putting together a list of names from 
Tidewater ,VA to have an event this summer for a kayaking group. I'd love to 
follow your progress. I have only planted one box on the water and haven't heard 
that anyone has been to it. Hopefully things will change this year.

Do you believe the sport of <br/>
letterboxing would be better served if <br/>
there were a time limit/deadline at <br/>
which point letterboxes should be <br/>
removed or changed?  <br/>
<br/>
  o Tes definitely, it would keep the field 'fresh' <br/>
  o Only in areas of high box/boxer concentration <br/>
  o No definitely not, consistancy should be maintained <br/>
  o while it should never be a requirement, it should be encouraged <br/>

I have not been following the list recently due to other constraints,<br/>
but I will offer the following words --<br/>
<br/>
* some old timers felt that it was a breach of letterboxing etiquette<br/>
  to discuss boxes so much (at all).  All this business about charm, foggy<br/>
  moors and mystique and treasure hunting and the like, now detached and<br/>
  subdivided in the mass production zone, to quote a famous Canadian <br/>
  drummer.  A little in the beginning, I guess, was ok (for some), but <br/>
  it (in the opinion of other somes), has gotten out of hand.  It has gone <br/>
  from beer, to wine, to brandy, to downright rotgut (viz. a previous <br/>
  message by me on the fermentation/distillation metaphor in the archives),<br/>
  and heading nowhere near Islay.  Of course, many old timers are now gone <br/>
  or underground -- I can say  with certainly that this is the reason in <br/>
  some cases.<br/>
<br/>
* As list owner, I get mountains of messages to crack down on this.  As<br/>
  a believer in self-organizing, decentralized systems, I have chosen not<br/>
  to.  I feel this is a community issue.  I do sympathize with these<br/>
  people, tho, and perhaps my known bias has lead me to be more neutral.<br/>
<br/>
* One would have to question whether matters of "etiquette" are best <br/>
  handled by a vote.  Social relativism (as opposed to absolutism) is a <br/>
  fascinating concept, and one I ascribe to personally, but it is not<br/>
  without its own sticky wickets ...<br/>
<br/>
* It would seem polite to ask the person who put in the time and the<br/>
  cash to create the box whether they want it listed.  Like I said, I<br/>
  have not been following this, so perhaps it is being done.  If it is<br/>
  not, that is a shame, IMHO.  I certainly hope mine don't show up <br/>
  there ... that would be against my wishes.   <br/>
<br/>
Well, this issue doesn't affect me to much, but I figured I'd throw some<br/>
words into the fray anyway ...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

Without the "oldtimers" you wouldn't have letterboxing!  Let's be <br/>
grateful for those pioneers and learn what there is to learn about <br/>
what THEY started and THEIR vision without thinking we know better.  <br/>
A little homage and respect for the 'elders' never hurt anyone.  You <br/>

<br/>
Should cheese racing be allowed at <br/>
letterboxing events? (This especially <br/>
pertains to the Oct 4th, 2003 Central <br/>
CA event: <br/>
http://webpages.charter.net/astroweaver/<br/>
letterboxing/meadow.html )  <br/>
<br/>
  o Absolutely not! Keep it at juggling events where it belongs. <br/>
  o Not unless it is to bother Geocachers. <br/>
  o Only if there are no children present. <br/>
  o No one should ever cheese race. It is disgusting. <br/>
  o Sure, bring it on! There are no rules! <br/>
  o Cheese racing can be abused but only by cheesy people. <br/>
  o Cheese racing brings about flaming on this board. Get rid of it! <br/>
  o One of my loved ones is addicted to cheese racing. No one cares! <br/>
  o When cheese racing is outlawed, only outlaws will have cheese. <br/>
  o If the cheese runs for governor of Ca., you have to have it at the event. <br/>

There has been some discussion on this <br/>
and other letterboxing groups about <br/>
store bought stamps. How do you feel <br/>
about store bought stamps? *No flaming <br/>
please* <br/>
<br/>
  o They count as another find or exchange. It does not matter to me. <br/>
  o I am disappointed to find anyone using them. <br/>
  o They are better than some poorly carved stamp. <br/>
  o They are okay for a sig stamp for folks just getting into letterboxing, but not in a box. <br/>
  o If it is appropriate to the person or location, sure. <br/>
  o Handcarved stamps are always better than store bought when it comes to letterboxing. <br/>

I think the list  <br/>
<br/>
  o is operating basically fine considering the number and diversity of members <br/>
  o could be better but what can the moderators do about 1400 different people <br/>
  o should be managed in a less laissez-faire manner <br/>
  o should be downright moderated by secret though police <br/>
  o would be fine if people would simply lighten up a bit <br/>
  o would be fine if certain people were voted off the island, and I have sent the list manager links to their offensive messages <br/>
  o would be fine if the moderators followed my suggestion which I have forwarded to the list manager <br/>
  o should have "list rules", a proposed draft of which I have sent to the list manager <br/>

How about another option:<br/>
I pay taxes for this public park and I don't have to ask permission to do anything else in the park so why should this be an exception.<br/>

Enter your vote today!  A new poll has been created for the <br/>
letterbox-usa group:<br/>
<br/>
How should routine questions, <br/>
like "what is a hitchhiker?" be handled? <br/>
<br/>
  o We should not have a rule, people should just answer on the list if they feel like it. <br/>
  o People who feel like it should answer these questions through private email. <br/>
  o A single member (perhaps we could take turns) would answer these questions on the list. <br/>
  o A single member (again taking turns) would answer these questions in private email <br/>
  o These questions should be ignored. <br/>
  o We should use stronger wording on the group page to tell new people to look for these answers before posting. <br/>
  o What _is_ a hitchhiker? <br/>
  o I don't see my answer here. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes, that would be true unless there were a<br/>
specific person chosen to take these questions,<br/>
In which case we could just assume they were<br/>
handling it. BUT, other than the hitchhiker<br/>
question, how would we know which questions the<br/>
group considers "routine"?<br/>
<br/>
If no specific person is chosen then yes, the<br/>
only way to know that a question was answered off<br/>
list would be to post "I got this one" or some such<br/>
thing on the list, in which case one wonders why not<br/>
just answer the thing directly on the list and be done<br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Also, as<br/>
&gt; with the compass question, there are multiple<br/>
&gt; "correct" answers, and so maybe a few answers<br/>
&gt; isn't a bad idea.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, even when we think the answers are cut and<br/>
dried, the constant infusion of new blood into<br/>
the group may produce new perspectives on many of<br/>
the old questions. This seems like an argument for<br/>
keeping all responses spontaneous and public.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; if designated answerers is one solution, they<br/>

<br/>
Complicated indeed! As far as I can tell from previous <br/>
postings, the primary reason for keeping responses off <br/>
the list was to cut down on the number of emails that<br/>
people are receiving. But I think many of these strategies<br/>
are likely to backfire. If we answer each common question<br/>
off list, only one person can benefit from each answer,<br/>
so the question may be asked much more often.<br/>
<br/>
For folks that are overwhelmed with the number of emails,<br/>
consider changing your mail preferences. This can be<br/>
accessed by clicking on "Edit my group preferences" on <br/>
the group home page. You can use digest<br/>
mode to get a single email with all of the day's posts <br/>
included. You can even choose not to get any mail, and view<br/>
the posts in the archives at your leisure. Recently, Yahoo <br/>
added an rss feed for the group, so you can use an rss<br/>
ticker to get immediate notification of new posts without <br/>
filling up your inbox.<br/>
<br/>
Folks, if you've got an opinion on this, be heard. Vote in<br/>
the poll, comment on the list. Let's get some positive<br/>
energy flowing on this list again. I think it is still <br/>
possible for this group to make decisions as a group, we<br/>
just need a little practice.<br/>

Maybe we need more specifics in the poll questions so that we know just what kind of questions are being considered "routine".  In the poll, does "routine" mean any FAQ, or does it mean an FAQ that is already answered in the LbNA website FAQs?!  I'm not trying to be funny here!  I'm asking this, because earlier in my newbier-days, I believe I asked a question that people thought was addressed in the LbNA FAQs and wasn't.  It WAS, however, answered in links that I hadn't noticed or paid enough attention to before asking.  I know, this sounds ultra-specific, but I think it's the specifics that will help people sort out what they think is a good solution.  Thanks  --lunaryakketyact  P.S.  How do we go about answering the poll?  I get my Yahoo stuff in email form... do I need to go on Yahoo groups to answer? <br/>

I think that if a question like that is asked, someone should just <br/>
answer it.  That way the asker doesn't get twenty emails from people <br/>
trying to be the 'one' to answer their question privately.  Also, it <br/>
might help future newbies when searching the archives.  This last <br/>
person said she/he searched the archives, and couldn't find <br/>
anything.  Their post was called something like "what is a <br/>
hitchiker?"...going forward if another newbie types that phrase into <br/>
the search, they might actually get the answer...rather than our <br/>
banter on what to do about people asking what hitchikers are.  <br/>

<br/>
I can see each side of the argument here.  The people that get the list one email at a time vs. those that get the <br/>
digest only.  Those that read it online at the yahoo website vs. those that don't.  Those that get their individual <br/>
emails in a limited platform. Those that have a limited amount of email space at where ever their email is hosted. Etc, <br/>
etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
First and foremost, I think we all need to take a step back and take a deep breath. Having good, friendly debates <br/>
about how to do something is a very good sign.  There are about a hundred ways of doing something and many good ideas <br/>
have come from it.  I, for one, like the single answer to the mailing list with the answer to the persons question.  I <br/>
do online customer support for several software packages and I can't tell you how many times people are just plain <br/>
confused about everything and the last thing they want is a brush off, even if what you gave them wasn't one.  They <br/>
can read everything in the world and they'll still not find the answer. Sometimes, people just want the answer, they <br/>
don't want to feel like they're in High School all over, being told to go find the answer themselves.  I'm NOT <br/>
accusing anyone of anything here at all, I'm just sharing my thoughts.  Of course, for this to work, people need to <br/>
make sure that the questions has not already been answered before they answer it.  We'll have a few overlaps, but, in <br/>
my not so humble opinion, less than the other experiences we've had in the past.<br/>
<br/>
I think the link to the FAQ and other pertinent info should be added to the welcome message to the group and I can <br/>
tell you it's not hard to do.<br/>
<br/>
And, just to share something I spoke with pandora about last night, I don't harbor any animosity towards anyone at all <br/>
on this list.  I may not see eye to eye with some of then, harsh words may have been exchanged, dirty laundry may have <br/>
been aired publicly, but I don't harbor any grudges or anger towards anyone.  I do apologize to everyone for <br/>
the 'implied' tone of my words at times, I am sorry if they upset, angered or hurt anyone.  I for one am taking a more <br/>
laid back attitude where the mailing list is concerned.  I'm going to try and not wear my emotions on my sleeve <br/>
anymore (That should be interesting!) and not be so sensitive to what's being said.  I ask others to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
May your finds be plentiful, your plants sublime and your enjoyment complete!<br/>

<br/>
I admit that MasterCarve (Carves Like Butter) does have some issues:<br/>
* a tad expensive (but hey, what is my time worth carving this?)<br/>
* a tad crumbly after zillions of stampings (ah, the Japanese ideal <br/>
of beauty: cherry blossoms!)and <br/>
* a tad hard to acquire in thinner slices.<br/>
<br/>
The pink stuff by Speedball is cheaper, not quite as crumbly, easier <br/>
to find. Still, give me the Carves Like Butter everytime! Did you <br/>
know it was invented by a lady stampmaker who sold the rights to it <br/>
after she was seriously injured in a car accident? Profits from the <br/>
sale have helped her in her recovery. At least that is what I am <br/>
told.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thank you folk for voting on the poll. If you haven't yet <br/>
cast your vote, please do. I will close it out in a bit. Anyone <br/>
having a super new material not mentioned? Hey, let us know. And <br/>
yes, I did have the names posted with the votes. Thought it would be <br/>
helpful for all of us to know who is doing what. Shall we next poll <br/>
on carving tools? *G*<br/>

Funny you should mention cheese.   I took a stamp carving class some months <br/>
ago where they gave us MasterCarve to use.   The instructor said, "It says <br/>
'carves like butter,' but I think it should be 'carves like cheese.'"<br/>
<br/>
Remember we're in South Florida.   Butter down here is REALLY soft!<br/>

What do you like most about finding a LB?<br/>
<br/>
o A good  clue? <br/>
o A good location? <br/>
o A great stamp?  <br/>
o A cool log-book? <br/>
o An old Logbook, with  lots of entries? <br/>
o Comradery of LB with others? <br/>

<br/>
It depends entirely on the specific letterbox:  Sometimes, it's the  thrill <br/>
of working out puzzling clues; sometimes it's the place, especially if  it's <br/>
scenic or historic or interesting, or just a great new discovery; sometimes  <br/>
it's the really clever or intricate stamp, or the stamps and notes left in the  <br/>
logbook entries; sometimes it's the possibility that I just might be FF (rarely <br/>
 happens, but sometimes!); I love the surprise of finding an "extra" - a <br/>
bonus  box, a HH, or just an unexpectedly clever logbook, or even a very clever <br/>
hiding  place. Taking someone else along just adds to the fun, but I also like <br/>
to  explore alone.  And, yes, I like to add to my F count!  I really  really <br/>
hate to give up on a hunt.  And, sometimes it's just the secret  pleasure of <br/>
knowing that it's still there after I've rehidden it and left it  with my stamp <br/>
in it, too.  -- Viewfinder (tx2chic) <br/>

  o Love it.  I wish everyone would let me know. <br/>
  o Don't really care one way or the other. <br/>

Since we can't seem to stop bickering about this, or at least let it go, how about we settle this once and for all. Vote on whether you would like to see a review feature similar to the geocaching site on LbNA. Then everyone regardless of which side they are on will be a grown up and quietly accept that the majority disagrees with them nor will the persons holding the opposing view gloat.<br/>
<br/>
Before voting take time to review this thread so that you are fully informed (and you will be) about both sides of this disagreement. Think about your vote and don't react emotionally to any percieved slights or petty nastiness on either side of the argument, how you feel about someone manners or personality is not the issue here. <br/>
<br/>
  o yes I would like to see a review feature similar to that on the geocaching site added to LbNA <br/>
  o No I would not  like to see a review feature similar to that on the geocaching site added to LbNA <br/>

was fun because the park's only 2 miles by 3 miles, easy to get to do <br/>
a lot of boxing.  <br/>
<br/>
But getting to the point:  our park manager didn't know about the <br/>
boxes so when our park ranger would run into them, he'd throw them <br/>
out, not knowing what they were, just a dirty bag with a plastic <br/>
container in it.  To them it looked like litered lunch.  Now I know <br/>
they just might have been not covered well, or moved by an animal, <br/>
but the point is, if you don't tell the manager, they don't tell <br/>
their team and people that don't know will just toss the 'liter.'<br/>
<br/>
Telling the manager may be scary or intimidating, but try writing a <br/>
letter or e-mail before visiting.  That may help.<br/>
<br/>
The managers need to know though, it may be public property, but it's <br/>
theirs to clean.  If they know it's there they could help recover it <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Just food for thought.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I finally got around to casting my "votes" on this (and a couple of<br/>
other polls I had missed), and thought that I would make a couple of<br/>
general comments...<br/>
<br/>
One of the great things about living in Ventura County is that we have<br/>
a large National Forest that covers the northern third, where hiding<br/>
little treasure boxes of all kinds (letterboxes, geocaches, supply<br/>
caches, etc.) is tolerated as long as they are hidden on/near<br/>
established roads and trails and do not impact on sensitive areas.  We<br/>
also have several State Parks and State Beaches in the County, or<br/>
nearby in Los Angeles County, and CalParks' semi-official position on<br/>
these things is "benign ignorance"; they don't really want to know<br/>
about them, but won't bother them out-of-hand, and if they aren't in a<br/>
sensitive area, they are fine, but if they get swept up in trash<br/>
removal and such activities, oh, well.  Can't complain about that! <br/>
There are also a couple of local agencies (COSCA is one) which<br/>
actually encourage the hiding of treasure boxes except in sensitive<br/>
areas.  A couple of COSCA rangers are occasional geocachers and one<br/>
also letterboxes now and then.  It is wonderful to have agencies that<br/>
at least tolerate us and will not deliberately go out of their way to<br/>
prevent us from playing our games.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the National Park Service owns a few parcels in and<br/>
near Ventura County, and we cannot hide *anything* on their land. <br/>
They will remove any that they find, and they will go looking for<br/>
them.  To be honest, we can live with that, as we have tons of other<br/>
options available.  And several of us "crazies" are also volunteers in<br/>
various ways, and the Superintendent has at least taken under<br/>
consideration allowing one geocache to be hidden in a park which gets<br/>
a fair amount of traffic, to see what its impact might be.  If this<br/>
happens, and if things go well, legally hiding LBs might be allowed<br/>
down the line.  But this is a long road, and I really do wish that<br/>
whoever hid five LBs at Circle X would pull them all, because that is<br/>
NPS land and they aren't going to help matters any.  There are a<br/>
couple of other agencies that do not like caches and LBs, but they<br/>
don't hunt for and remove them, at least.  Still, if you are seen off<br/>
trail, you could be questioned and they will demand that any boxes be<br/>
removed immediately.  The key is always to be careful, no matter on<br/>
whose land you are hunting.<br/>
<br/>
The real problem, though, is in city-owned parks.  I and others have<br/>
gotten permission to hide caches and boxes in them, only to have the<br/>
groundskeepers pull them, anyway.  Many of these workers are not<br/>
highly-paid, and they are basically just mowers and choppers and<br/>
sweepers who don't really have the time to see if that piece of<br/>
plastic is an LB, or just something dropped by a careless picnicker. <br/>
Can't say that I blame them.  Thus, most of the things hidden in parks<br/>
are very small, and they tend to vanish in months or even weeks.  Once<br/>
bitten, twice shy; lose a couple of these, and one tends to give up. <br/>
A couple of days ago, I e-mailed a local new boxer about a series of<br/>
three LBs in a park in the city of Ventura.  She asked me where it<br/>
was, as she couldn't find the listing.  I looked and it was gone, less<br/>
than a year after it was hidden :-(  A nice series, although one of<br/>
the boxes required incredible stealth and might have caused the whole<br/>
series to be pulled.  I was the first to find that one, but several<br/>
other boxers had stamped in the other two before I got them; I got all<br/>
three on the same day.  I know, however, that geocaching is allowed in<br/>
that park; we have two caches in it and there are 6 or 8 others in it.<br/>
None of them has ever had problems, except for one that was hidden too<br/>
close to a large picnic area.  A lot of it is in the placement, not in<br/>
the park rules.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, permission isn't always going to help.  It certainly is not a<br/>
guarantee.  The best way to protect your letterboxes is to hide them<br/>
in places where "common folk" (we call them "geo-muggles", or just<br/>
muggles, in caching, and I have seen that term used occasionally in<br/>
letterboxing: it works) are not likely to go.  Urban LBs are much<br/>
harder to hide than urban caches.  An urban micro geocache can be a<br/>
35mm film can or even smaller; it's tough to make a letterbox that<br/>
small.  Thus, it really is more likely that an LB will survive in wild<br/>
country, rather than civilized areas.  There are always exceptions, of<br/>
course, but you can't complain if a box 30 feet from a picnic bench<br/>
gets muggled.  No matter how well you hide it, kids playing can find<br/>
almost anything; the better hidden it is, the more likely they are to<br/>
find it, for some reason :-o  And it is a general truism that the<br/>
wilder the country (within reason), the less likely you will need to<br/>
worry much about permission, anyway.  Use your brains and your eyes<br/>
when hiding, and you are probably going to have a hide that will be<br/>
there for years :-)<br/>

&gt; One of the great things about living in Ventura County is that we have<br/>
&gt; a large National Forest that covers the northern third, where hiding<br/>
&gt; little treasure boxes of all kinds (letterboxes, geocaches, supply<br/>
&gt; caches, etc.) is tolerated as long as they are hidden on/near<br/>
&gt; established roads and trails and do not impact on sensitive areas. We<br/>
&gt; also have several State Parks and State Beaches in the County, or<br/>
&gt; nearby in Los Angeles County, and CalParks' semi-official position on<br/>
&gt; these things is "benign ignorance"; they don't really want to know<br/>
&gt; about them, but won't bother them out-of-hand, and if they aren't in a<br/>
&gt; sensitive area, they are fine, but if they get swept up in trash<br/>
&gt; removal and such activities, oh, well. Can't complain about that!<br/>
&gt; There are also a couple of local agencies (COSCA is one) which<br/>
&gt; actually encourage the hiding of treasure boxes except in sensitive<br/>
&gt; areas. A couple of COSCA rangers are occasional geocachers and one<br/>
&gt; also letterboxes now and then. It is wonderful to have agencies that<br/>
&gt; at least tolerate us and will not deliberately go out of their way to<br/>
&gt; prevent us from playing our games.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the other hand, the National Park Service owns a few parcels in and<br/>
&gt; near Ventura County, and we cannot hide *anything* on their land.<br/>
&gt; They will remove any that they find, and they will go looking for<br/>
&gt; them. To be honest, we can live with that, as we have tons of other<br/>
&gt; options available. And several of us "crazies" are also volunteers in<br/>
&gt; various ways, and the Superintendent has at least taken under<br/>
&gt; consideration allowing one geocache to be hidden in a park which gets<br/>
&gt; a fair amount of traffic, to see what its impact might be. If this<br/>
&gt; happens, and if things go well, legally hiding LBs might be allowed<br/>
&gt; down the line. But this is a long road, and I really do wish that<br/>
&gt; whoever hid five LBs at Circle X would pull them all, because that is<br/>
&gt; NPS land and they aren't going to help matters any. There are a<br/>
&gt; couple of other agencies that do not like caches and LBs, but they<br/>
&gt; don't hunt for and remove them, at least. Still, if you are seen off<br/>
&gt; trail, you could be questioned and they will demand that any boxes be<br/>
&gt; removed immediately. The key is always to be careful, no matter on<br/>
&gt; whose land you are hunting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The real problem, though, is in city-owned parks. I and others have<br/>
&gt; gotten permission to hide caches and boxes in them, only to have the<br/>
&gt; groundskeepers pull them, anyway. Many of these workers are not<br/>
&gt; highly-paid, and they are basically just mowers and choppers and<br/>
&gt; sweepers who don't really have the time to see if that piece of<br/>
&gt; plastic is an LB, or just something dropped by a careless picnicker.<br/>
&gt; Can't say that I blame them. Thus, most of the things hidden in parks<br/>
&gt; are very small, and they tend to vanish in months or even weeks. Once<br/>
&gt; bitten, twice shy; lose a couple of these, and one tends to give up.<br/>
&gt; A couple of days ago, I e-mailed a local new boxer about a series of<br/>
&gt; three LBs in a park in the city of Ventura. She asked me where it<br/>
&gt; was, as she couldn't find the listing. I looked and it was gone, less<br/>
&gt; than a year after it was hidden :-( A nice series, although one of<br/>
&gt; the boxes required incredible stealth and might have caused the whole<br/>
&gt; series to be pulled. I was the first to find that one, but several<br/>
&gt; other boxers had stamped in the other two before I got them; I got all<br/>
&gt; three on the same day. I know, however, that geocaching is allowed in<br/>
&gt; that park; we have two caches in it and there are 6 or 8 others in it.<br/>
&gt; None of them has ever had problems, except for one that was hidden too<br/>
&gt; close to a large picnic area. A lot of it is in the placement, not in<br/>
&gt; the park rules.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thus, permission isn't always going to help. It certainly is not a<br/>
&gt; guarantee. The best way to protect your letterboxes is to hide them<br/>
&gt; in places where "common folk" (we call them "geo-muggles", or just<br/>
&gt; muggles, in caching, and I have seen that term used occasionally in<br/>
&gt; letterboxing: it works) are not likely to go. Urban LBs are much<br/>
&gt; harder to hide than urban caches. An urban micro geocache can be a<br/>
&gt; 35mm film can or even smaller; it's tough to make a letterbox that<br/>
&gt; small. Thus, it really is more likely that an LB will survive in wild<br/>
&gt; country, rather than civilized areas. There are always exceptions, of<br/>
&gt; course, but you can't complain if a box 30 feet from a picnic bench<br/>
&gt; gets muggled. No matter how well you hide it, kids playing can find<br/>
&gt; almost anything; the better hidden it is, the more likely they are to<br/>
&gt; find it, for some reason :-o And it is a general truism that the<br/>
&gt; wilder the country (within reason), the less likely you will need to<br/>
&gt; worry much about permission, anyway. Use your brains and your eyes<br/>
&gt; when hiding, and you are probably going to have a hide that will be<br/>
&gt; there for years :-)<br/>

Hi chaosmanor<br/>
<br/>
We adopted lonewolf's Circle X letterbox quite some time ago and have <br/>
maintained it since then with the help of PeterK. When was this area <br/>
put into the NPS system?<br/>
I wasn't aware of the other 5 boxes.<br/>
Normally the NPS does a pretty good job at cruising the net and <br/>
googling up letterbox clues, so I'm a bit surprised that I hadn't <br/>
received a warning note on this one.<br/>

Don, your cache up near Balanced Rock may be OK, but if so, it's very<br/>
close to the NPS boundary.  The "Circle X Ranch" LB is either on NPS<br/>
land or on Private Property.  Split Rock and Balanced Rock are within<br/>
NPS boundaries, and have been since 1989.  Tri-Peaks is just inside<br/>
CalParks property; I mention this to show the extent of the NPS<br/>
ownership.  That whole Circle X Ranch area was purchased from the<br/>
State of California, which got it from the Boy Scouts.  But I wasn't<br/>
talking about that LB.  The series of five is on the Grotto Trail,<br/>
which starts just below the Circle X Ranger Station.  It's called<br/>
"Children's Book Series", and was planted by ToT.  It was listed last<br/>
February; we were FTF last April; the last logged Find on LbNA was in<br/>
October.  The owner has not responded to e-mails from me.  Sorry about<br/>
the confusion; I should have mentioned the name of the series.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Normally the NPS does a pretty good job at cruising the net and <br/>
&gt; googling up letterbox clues, so I'm a bit surprised that I hadn't <br/>
&gt; received a warning note on this one.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that they are short-handed and can't spare the time to go<br/>
after that stuff unless they are doing something else in the same<br/>
area.  I do occasional volunteer trail maintenance for the SMM Trails<br/>
Council, which works with all of the agencies that own land up there,<br/>
and I know several NPS employees and volunteers; they all talk about<br/>
manpower shortages.  It's hard enough to keep the bathrooms clean and<br/>
trash cans emptied; going after plastic containers behind rocks and<br/>
inside stumps isn't a high priority.<br/>
<br/>
In any event, I'm actually more concerned about the second box of the<br/>
series being in a huge pile of poison oak.  Unless the stuff is in<br/>
full leaf, too many people can't recognize it.  Last year, with the<br/>
low rainfall, a lot of the stuff died off sooner than usual.  I didn't<br/>
get the second box, as I recognized it right away, despite the lack of<br/>
foliage.  Went back later, and the stuff was in leaf and covering the<br/>
box.  Told the owner, and s/he ignored me.  The clues have not<br/>
changed.  IMHO, that's irresponsible, and this whole situation could<br/>
give our hobby a bad name.  Things like this are why I would like to<br/>
have a "boxer review" option on LbNA and AQ.  But I've been outvoted<br/>
too often for me to keep bringing it up.  I only mention it as it is<br/>
appropriate in this circumstance.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone has a nice, long weekend!<br/>

The letterboxing community is kind of disjointed.  While quite a few people are active on several websites and blogs, a lot of people stick to one main site.  So...How unified do you think the letterboxing community should be? <br/>
<br/>
  o I think the LB community should be very united with all the sites answering/coordinated by one main site. <br/>
  o I don't think there should be any unity with as many sites as people want to make and little or no communication between them. <br/>
  o I think there should be more communication between the sites that are already around. <br/>
  o I like the way it is now. <br/>

one site but it's kind of a shame too...I hope I said that clearly.  <br/>

&gt; ...How unified do you think the letterboxing community should be? <br/>
<br/>
As someone who is more a geocacher than a letterboxer, it might<br/>
surprise people to find that, while I think that more unity would be<br/>
nice, I don't think I'd want to see too much more of it than already<br/>
exists.  Heck, even geocaching, which a priori needs a bit more unity,<br/>
isn't quite the monolithic structure that many people think it is. <br/>
There are at least two competing sites for caches, and there are many<br/>
people who rail against the semi-autocratic nature of the "Rulers of<br/>
Groundspeak".  Yet that site survives in part by acknowledging that<br/>
not everyone agrees with them, that that's OK, and that most people<br/>
will still want to play because Groundspeak offers the best package,<br/>
over-all.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing doesn't really have the need for that much more unity. <br/>
Sure, it would be nice if people were better at geography: Malibu is<br/>
*not* in Ventura County, and there are no oceans to the north!  It<br/>
would be nice if there was a moderator for clues who could fix things<br/>
like that.  But there is really only one area that ticks me off about<br/>
LB, and that is the sometimes-cavalier attitude that a few (emphasis:<br/>
a few) boxers have about their hides.  I do *not* like the attitude<br/>
of, "Once it's hidden, it's not my worry, anymore."  There are boxers<br/>
who feel that way, and they are selfish.  I have never liked that and<br/>
have railed against it in several LB fora.  It's the one place where<br/>
geocaching has got it rock-solid perfect: you hide it, you keep it up,<br/>
you check up on it when two or three people can't find it, you replace<br/>
it when it goes missing, you pick up the pieces when geo-muggles wreck<br/>
it.  If there was one area where LB needs a reality check, this is it.<br/>
 And the fact is, most boxers *do* have the right attitude.  I would<br/>
just like to see it codified a little better.  Beyond that, why screw<br/>
around with something that's been going well for so long?<br/>

&gt; Whoa!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; ...How unified do you think the letterboxing community should be? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As someone who is more a geocacher than a letterboxer, it might<br/>
&gt; surprise people to find that, while I think that more unity would be<br/>
&gt; nice, I don't think I'd want to see too much more of it than already<br/>
&gt; exists.  Heck, even geocaching, which a priori needs a bit more unity,<br/>
&gt; isn't quite the monolithic structure that many people think it is. <br/>
&gt; There are at least two competing sites for caches, and there are many<br/>
&gt; people who rail against the semi-autocratic nature of the "Rulers of<br/>
&gt; Groundspeak".  Yet that site survives in part by acknowledging that<br/>
&gt; not everyone agrees with them, that that's OK, and that most people<br/>
&gt; will still want to play because Groundspeak offers the best package,<br/>
&gt; over-all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Letterboxing doesn't really have the need for that much more unity. <br/>
&gt; Sure, it would be nice if people were better at geography: Malibu is<br/>
&gt; *not* in Ventura County, and there are no oceans to the north!  It<br/>
&gt; would be nice if there was a moderator for clues who could fix things<br/>
&gt; like that.  But there is really only one area that ticks me off about<br/>
&gt; LB, and that is the sometimes-cavalier attitude that a few (emphasis:<br/>
&gt; a few) boxers have about their hides.  I do *not* like the attitude<br/>
&gt; of, "Once it's hidden, it's not my worry, anymore."  There are boxers<br/>
&gt; who feel that way, and they are selfish.  I have never liked that and<br/>
&gt; have railed against it in several LB fora.  It's the one place where<br/>
&gt; geocaching has got it rock-solid perfect: you hide it, you keep it up,<br/>
&gt; you check up on it when two or three people can't find it, you replace<br/>
&gt; it when it goes missing, you pick up the pieces when geo-muggles wreck<br/>
&gt; it.  If there was one area where LB needs a reality check, this is it.<br/>
&gt;  And the fact is, most boxers *do* have the right attitude.  I would<br/>
&gt; just like to see it codified a little better.  Beyond that, why screw<br/>
&gt; around with something that's been going well for so long?<br/>

But since clues for many, many letterboxes are quickly and easily available at LbNA at AQ, it seems there should be plenty for those with less time and inclination to locate without undue searching.  Then there are those clues and boxes that are not spoon-fed on a platter...  for letterboxers so inclined to track down the true treasures and experience/enjoy another dimension of the game.  Perhaps the appearance of disjointedness is in actuality diversity, which affords something for everyone.<br/>

&gt; Well, considering that things have already been screwed around with, <br/>
&gt; I guess the answer to the question "who gets to do the screwing?" <br/>
&gt; is "anyone that created another Letterbox Website after LBNA", since <br/>
&gt; it was first and doing quite well for a long time.  It's a moot point <br/>
&gt; anyway since multiple communities are here to stay no matter what <br/>
&gt; some desire.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Indeed!  And who would be the ones to decide who gets to do the <br/>
&gt; &gt; screwing?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Beyond that, why screw around with something that's been going well <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; so long?<br/>

Enter your vote today!  A new poll has been created for the <br/>
letterbox-usa group:<br/>
<br/>
In a recent poll, 29% of repondents said high fuel prices would have no effect on their letterboxing activities, 40% said they would combine letterboxing with other activities to limit travel, 19% said they would letterbox closer to home, 8% said they would letterbox less often, and 1% would use other forms of transportation.<br/>
Since fuel prices seem to be affecting the majority, how would you prefer that those who plant letterboxes plant future ones to help you out? <br/>
<br/>
  o Change nothing - the way letterboxes are planted is fine with me. <br/>
  o Plant more in urban areas and less in rural areas <br/>
  o Plant letterboxes in series within walking distance of each other to save driving <br/>
  o Plant letterboxes in areas where other recreation takes place so I can combine activities and save gas. <br/>
  o Plant letterboxes near or along bicycle routes. <br/>
  o Other - explain <br/>
