A most persuasive argument for handcarved stamps<br/>
(for those of us who may still be hesitant).<br/>
I would love to have one of my children . . .<br/>

Great work!<br/>

This is a wonderful stamp! I love how you captured the essence of your  <br/>
daughter and kept the stamp simple... that's probably really hard to  <br/>
do! Did you just go by the photo, or did you do some tracing or  <br/>
anything else with it first?<br/>
<br/>
PS... It's going to be hard getting those crumbs just right on your  <br/>
son's messy face ;-P<br/>

Thanks and I wanted to say your kitty stamp is amazing! <br/>

I did the same thing you did with photoshop only I used photoshop <br/>

Hee, hee, I won't be attempting those crumbs on my son's stamp.  ; )<br/>
