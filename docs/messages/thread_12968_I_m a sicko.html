&gt; &gt; I discovered that there was a mystery box on my way to work so at <br/>
&gt; 6a.m. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was letterboxing. After working for 10 hours I stopped on my way <br/>
&gt; home at<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4:30p.m. to letterbox some more. How sick is this and is there a <br/>
&gt; cure?<br/>

for every occasion that takes us to a different area, weddings, <br/>
reunions, and yes (I hate to admit it) funerals too (they just turned <br/>
up the temperature 10 degrees for us in hell). I know, its bad but <br/>
if we kicked and someone wanted to check out a box near our <br/>
funeral, we would totally understand, its the addiction, you cant <br/>
help it. WE have actually had second thoughts about events that <br/>
didn't offer some LBing getaway while we were there. There you <br/>
go, another 10 degrees. It will be toasty where we are going, <br/>
anyone want to join us??<br/>

The Travelin' Trouts<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Heck, we'll probably hide a LB when we get there too.<br/>
