they are apparently getting pretty full and we will not be able to get <br/>
to them until<br/>
at least late October and possibly not until November.<br/>
Thank you so much.<br/>
And much thanks to everyone who has kept us posted as to their travels <br/>
to these spots.<br/>
They are very easy drive bys on the I-5.<br/>
