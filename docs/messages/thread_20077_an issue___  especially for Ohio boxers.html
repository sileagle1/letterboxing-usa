I wanted to warn you all in Ohio about something that ended up in my inbox <br/>
tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Back story:<br/>
<br/>
I was on vacation in Ohio last week, and planted two boxes near our vacation <br/>
house on Lake Erie.  The clues were up for a couple of days when I realized <br/>
(the hard way) that there's some kind of poisonous plant near the tree where I <br/>
planted Box #1.  It doesn't look like poison ivy, but let's just say that the <br/>
left side of my face got all red and swollen, but it didn't itch.  When I was <br/>
trying to figure out where I picked it up, I narrowed it down to that.  On the <br/>
day we left, I removed the box, and updated the clue on the letterboxing.org <br/>
page, stating that it had been removed, and why.  Box #2 remains in its <br/>
original location.  I just felt that it wouldn't be right to send people to this <br/>
location, after I got sick.<br/>
<br/>
I got an email tonight from someone saying that he was upset that he couldn't <br/>
find the Miniature Golf box.  I responded by telling him the story, but said <br/>
that I was glad that he had located my Eddie's Grill box.<br/>
<br/>
He wrote back saying that he was very angry with me, because he wasted a lot <br/>
of time searching for the Mini Golf box.  He told me that he was going to <br/>
remove my Eddie's Grill box (which he has NO right to do, but as I live in <br/>
Connecticut, I have no way of preventing him).  He went on to say that he would be <br/>
relocating 15 boxes in eastern Ohio and attempting to return the stamps to their <br/>
owners, and that I've ruined the hobby of letterboxing by removing the box <br/>
near the plants that would make people sick.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I can think of at this point is to inform you of this, in case <br/>
anyone here who has boxes in Ohio wishes to write to this guy and tell him to <br/>
STAY AWAY from their boxes.  I can forward his email address.  I'm sorry this <br/>
happened.  I really don't know what else to do about this, but I did email <br/>
him and ask him not to remove my Eddie's Grill box, or anyone else's.  I also <br/>
told him that I stand by my decision to remove the Mini Golf box, rather than to <br/>
leave it in a location that may cause other people to have an allergic <br/>
reaction, particularly because I updated the website on the same day.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Chrissy,  WOW!  Is this guy for real??  That's completely ridiculous.  I can't imagine how you could have handled it any better, and certainly if you'd have been some kind of uncaring person and left the box near the offensive plant, other people would have been sure to bang down your door yelling at you for that too!  That person sounds nuts.  He's going to RELOCATE 15 boxes and return stamps to their owners??  What does relocate mean?  And what in the world does this have to do with your thoughtfulness?  I think you should post the email address right away and make sure the guy is barraged with emails from Ohio people, at the very least.  Maybe some of you who live in those areas could post some watches near your boxes and see if you notice someone hauling the boxes away.  Of course, I don't know what you'd do then.  Confronting him would probably be nuts too if he is the kind of loose cannon he sounds like.  I probably wouldn't have the guts to go near him.  Good luck with however you all decide to handle this.  Keep us posted.   --lunaryakketyact<br/>

Sounds like you did everything right &amp; with any luck he is all <br/>
bluster &amp; bluff.  Warning people is the right thing to do- have <br/>
someone check on your other box this week &amp; perhaps in a few more <br/>
weeks to make sure it is there- with any luck it will be.  I'll <br/>
cross my fingers for you.  <br/>
<br/>
You made the right decision &amp; I hope your face is feeling better!<br/>
