think this discussion has mad me sick. i like the way things are. <br/>
can't we all agree to disagree. no no wait! that's not what i meant. <br/>
why don't we step away from the computer and step into the woods. look <br/>
for some boxes. discover new places. i've done just that the past few <br/>
days and loved every minute of it. of all the posts i have recieved in <br/>
my mailbox this past week, about 2% of them have been something else <br/>
other than review. go outside. box. i felt better when i went boxing <br/>
today and i hope everyone will to when they back away from the <br/>
computer.<br/>
