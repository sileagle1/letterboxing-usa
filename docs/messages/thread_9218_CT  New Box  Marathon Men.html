Niantic (Town of East Lyme, New London County) CT<br/>
<br/>
Placed by green heron<br/>
<br/>
Stamp and box dedicated to my son and son-in-law who both finished <br/>
the Mystic Places Marathon on 10/27/02 in just over 4 hours, a truly <br/>
remarkable achievement in my (sedentary) eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Don't let the name fool you.  This marathon is run entirely in <br/>
Niantic, along the shore of Long Island Sound.  It was called the <br/>
East Lyme Marathon for years, until the tourism gurus decided it <br/>
would attract more attention and money if it was renamed after the <br/>
more famous village 20 miles to the east.  That's okay.  Here in <br/>
Niantic we relish our obscurity!<br/>
<br/>
This box is inside an area where a fee is charged Memorial Day to  <br/>
Labor Day<br/>
<br/>
Course map is at www.mysticplacesmarathon.com.  From the third relay <br/>
transfer point, follow Main Street east to Baptist Lane.  Take <br/>
Baptist Lane south and through the hole in the wall.  After you cross <br/>
under the railroad tracks, turn right and follow the path that <br/>
parallels the railroad tracks.  At the end of the beach follow the <br/>
path to the left along the edge of  McCook's Point.  Enjoy the <br/>
beautiful view.  Follow the path until you come to a huge beech tree.<br/>
<br/>
On a bearing 218 degrees from the base of the tree you will see a low <br/>
rock with a pink stripe in it.  Just ahead on the beach side is an <br/>
opening for a path.  Proceed cautiously down this path.  You will see <br/>
2 large rocks behind a small cedar.  Your treasure is underneath the <br/>
closer rock on the right side of the cedar.  Watch your step here and <br/>
the stamp in discretely.<br/>
<br/>
Continue along the path to the parking lot below and exit through the <br/>
main gate.  Turn right on Atlantic Street, right on Columbus Ave., <br/>
and right on Main Street to return to your starting point.<br/>
