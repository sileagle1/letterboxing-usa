Copyright is the word you're looking for, and considering the amount of work (possibly work done as a mainstay) that ANY artist might have done before you is ALWAYS a good idea!</div><div><br/></div><div>Even if it may seem trivial from where you sit, or for the use you're planning with someone else's artwork, you will never really know if it's  "OK" to use it unless you know. A good part of my income comes from making and selling various works of art, and I will never just make an assumption that it's fine to use someone else's work or a derivative of it,  even if I'm not monetarily profiting from it, because I know how rotten it feels when it happens to me. </div><div><br/></div><div>The main point, beyond the legalities or copyrights or anything, is common courtesy... and, almost more importantly, helping artists of every type educate the public about the importance of honoring another human being's handiwork.  I do a lot of photography, and with the ease of copying, distributing, modifying artwork with a computer &amp; on the net (&amp; ease of removing copyrights) it's gotten horrifically frustrating to get people to treat artists with respect. Just because you CAN copy or reproduce something easily doesn't mean you SHOULD! </div><div><br/></div><div>Lastly, because I don't have more time to go into this mire right now:  At the very least, if you can find an artist (which is usually not too hard these days)  you can ask permission.  Most artists will greatly appreciate that you took the time to ask, because so few people do these days. People just copy off music &amp; art &amp; film right &amp; left these days because they can (&amp; therefore mistakenly think they MAY), so one more person caring to ask whether they may use a work, &amp; helping others understand they should do the same is too rare but highly appreciated by artists.  Thank you!       -- an Artist. </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></body></html>

                    <html><body><p>I would agree that asking for permission is the courteous thing to do, but is not always feasible.  Also, you are not technically copying an artist's creation, you are creating your own artistic creation based on their creation.  And in my case, since I am not an expert carver, the result is usually not even close to the same image.  Not sure where this falls legally, but doesn't seem wrong to me.  I guess to be fair you could give credit to the original artist in your clues if you know who the artist is.  It is an interesting question and well worth discussing  on this forum, something that has been lacking for years.<br/><br/>Silver Eagle</p></body></html>
