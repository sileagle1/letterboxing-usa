Subject: Ct. Traveller found<br/>
<br/>
The Peter J.McGuire " Traveller" was picked up by Lobsta on Thursday <br/>
while checking the boxes on the Sleeping Giant. in Hamden Ct. It was <br/>
planted in the Metal box of the Oriental Five Elements on Sunday. Lucky <br/>
for him that Butterfly and Bluebird were flying by and grabbed it for <br/>
the stamp is " one to die " for. We leapfrogged it from Metal to Wood <br/>
and off 10 steps behind a tree. Bluebird then flew off with it to the <br/>
west . Who knows where she will drop him? I must say that anyone who <br/>
gets this stamp in their book in one happy boxer. It is beautiful and <br/>
the carving is top of the heap. Aili and Bruce , you did a great job and <br/>
we three feel honored to have the image in our books. The way it gets <br/>
'planted' is great fun and gives us pause to look around looking for <br/>
another spot to plant. How in the world do we count this guy ??<br/>

Subject: NC/SC off-topic request<br/>
<br/>
I've been charged with finding a location in NC or SC, on the coast, that <br/>
has a lot of great places to walk *from one central point*.<br/>
<br/>
I've only been to Myrtle Beach and Charleston, and while I know there are <br/>
10k volkswalks there, I need a place that could have as many as 10 different <br/>
routes, all starting from a reasonable hotel. The routes could overlap or <br/>
crisscross some.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any ideas, please pmail me....thanks!<br/>

<br/>
Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I planted my first letterbox this weekend. It is in Toledo, IA.<br/>
<br/>
It is fairly easy to find.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the directions/clues:<br/>
<br/>
Drive to Toledo IA. Take Highway 30 West towards the Mesqwauki <br/>
Casino. On the edge of town there is the Toledo City Park. Pull in <br/>
the park and drive west on the road that runs parallel to the highway <br/>
until you reach a small picnic shelter. <br/>
<br/>
Get out of your car and walk straight from the shelter into the <br/>
trees. No more than twenty paces in (If you reach the creek you have <br/>
walked too far), you will come upon a large fallen tree. In a hole <br/>
in the base of the tree is the Tama Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting. <br/>

To the webmaster,<br/>

the link to the clues to the Cupcake LB in Lisbon, CT seems to be <br/>
broken. I have tried to access it a few times over the last 3 or 4 <br/>
days and get an error each time. I also searched the archives <br/>
for "cupcake" but nothing came up.<br/>

I chose that place to visit for my 400F. (Yeehaw!)<br/>

Hey there, Chuck<br/>
<br/>
December 2001? I'll have to look that one up in my<br/>
notebook...lol. Perhaps, now that I think of it. Do<br/>
you recall what was said? lol<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I stopped by a few of your sites in Ashford<br/>
and Eastford yesterday. I enjoyed them all! The<br/>
weather was great and the sites you chose were scenic.<br/>
I love that part of the state.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi there, Chuck!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I was wondering the same thing. I stumbled on a<br/>
&gt; very<br/>
&gt; &gt; old box in Hampton a couple of weeks ago. (Was it<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; an old H20 container?) I counted it, but I'm not<br/>
&gt; sure<br/>
&gt; &gt; what to call it. I think I labelled it in my book<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; "EMS/Unknown box". Anyway, if you learn anything<br/>

That's the song that has been going around in Peanut's head ever since<br/>
they caught the Sniper in the DC area. We celebrated by heading out<br/>
and letterboxing for the first time in over a month. Ended up having<br/>
a great day on Saturday. Had great weather, saw lots of great fall<br/>
colors and had our most productive day yet. <br/>

ATTN LB'ers who plan to attend: Please bring lawn chairs since <br/>
seating might be limited. LOCAL LB'ers--if you have lightweight <br/>
portable tables, you might want to bring them, too. There is one <br/>
large picnic table in the area where we plan on meeting--but we may <br/>
need others with food/exchanges depending on how many people <br/>
participate. Thank you for your help in this matter. I have RSVPs <br/>
from about 25 people so far (with several others who are tentative).<br/>

<br/>
Think about boxes you plan to place in the park, food, drinks &amp; <br/>
the likes. Mid-morning Potluck! ;) Potluck from 10am-12pm noon (bring <br/>
enough food/drinks and appropriate supplies for the number of folks <br/>
in your group). As for boxes, please post your clues <br/>
to the website a few days prior to the event. If not, please <br/>
bring several sets of clues with you to the event that day to share <br/>
with the other LBers. I'm sure I'm forgetting something, please feel <br/>
free to help fill in the details as we go along! <br/>
DON'T FORGET TO PLAN FOR NW WEATHER--THIS EVENT WILL GO ON RAIN OR <br/>
SHINE!!!<br/>
