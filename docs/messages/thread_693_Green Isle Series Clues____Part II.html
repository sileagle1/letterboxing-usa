                    <div class="plaintext-content">Directions:  Walk back to your car either taking the<br/>
path backwards or walking out of the park and turning<br/>
Right.  Follow E. River Drive to Allouez Ave.  Turn<br/>
Right and there is your car. Drive your car back to<br/>
the park.  Upon entering the park, drive to the lot<br/>
near the Tennis Courts.  It is the last lot on the<br/>
Left before the road goes into trees.<br/>
Continue walking on the paved path...The next four are<br/>
on this latter part of the walk.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Box E:  Once under the First of two overpasses for 172<br/>
E/W, on the right side you will see some rocks in the<br/>
tall grass.  There is a grouping of three that hold<br/>
your prise for getting this far.  The one hidding your<br/>
box looks like it was placed there. :)<br/>
Box D:  Continue under 172 following the river more<br/>
closely now.  On your right before the diamonds and<br/>
playing fields, there is a lone pine tree.  Under some<br/>
rocks before the tree the next box is placed.  You<br/>
will have to get on your hands and knees for this one.<br/>
Sorry.<br/>
Box C:  Again continue on the path.  After passing<br/>
some homes, you will come to a wooden area near the<br/>
bank of the river.  There U will find a few trees that<br/>
learned how to write.  They form a U.  Under this<br/>
letter the box is kept.  (U may not see the letter<br/>
until after U pass it, but it is there.)<br/>
Box H:  Coming around a curve in the paved path, you<br/>
will see another overpass in the distance.  This is<br/>
Humbolt Road.  The last box is placed there.  A Big<br/>
boulder on the Right is housing your box.  There is a<br/>
smallish rock protecting it.  <br/>
<br/>
Congradulations!  You have done it.  The whole walking<br/>
time should only take you two hours.  On the walk back<br/>
to your car from the first four I'm thinking of<br/>
placing a bonus box.  You pass a small park during<br/>
this part of the trip.  I'll let you know when I place<br/>
it.  <br/>
Love you all.  Die xo<br/>
