Tell you what, bring up all those stories, tips, etc related to letterboxing and NOTHING ELSE, and we'll discuss them.  While we're waiting for those topics, anyone who is interested in discussing whether we should apply some of the principles adopted by geocachers to our letterboxing practices (and btw I would say "no" regarding the distance rules that were mentioned) is welcome to comment until nobody wants to comment anymore.  And then we'll discuss something else, or listen to the crickets for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
As long as everybody plays nice--by which I mean, attack the IDEAS being discussed as much as you'd like, but not the people who brought them up--<br/>
we should be ok.<br/>
<br/>
After all, it's not like there are a finite number of posts that can be made, and if we use them all up talking about caches we won't be able to say anything about letterboxes....<br/>

Sure you can, nothing stopping you. If you want to see discussions about letterboxing on the gc forums, you can do a search on the forum website for the word "letterboxing" (you need to log in first to do a search). <br/>

&gt; If the description bothers anyone I guess you could ask Randy to <br/>
&gt; address it.<br/>
<br/>
It used to also say the list is "loose" and "limited off-topic ok<br/>
within reason", or words to that effect.  It may still, for all I<br/>
know, or perhaps I or one of the other moderators edited that out.<br/>
I don't remember, and more importantly, I don't care, tho that<br/>
remains my sentiment.<br/>
<br/>
So it comes down to "within reason".  People speak of all sort of<br/>
off-topic cruft on this list, but apparently "geocaching" rankles<br/>
some members.  I know _repeating_ that website X or Y is up or<br/>
down, after the initial post conveying this information has<br/>
already been made, rankles me, so we all have our pet peeves, I<br/>
suppose.<br/>
<br/>
I can make rules, I can enforce rules, I can boot people off the<br/>
island when I'm in a bad mood (and I often do), I can even ride my<br/>
bike with no handlebars, but I can't legislate social grace and<br/>
nicety.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion, as social member of civil society, is that when I see<br/>
several fellow members objecting to a marginal topic, the polite<br/>
thing is to back off or move it to a more appropriate forum,<br/>
especially if it is unimportant.  When I see the initiator, when<br/>
faced with these objections, say "thanks, but I'm going to press<br/>
on anyway" (or words to that effect, several times), I say to<br/>
myself -- well, that may or may not fall within the legislated<br/>
bounds of the  list charter, but it certainly isn't very polite,<br/>
is it?  So that's the extent of my personal opinion on the<br/>
matter, after which I add the responsible part(ies) to my spam<br/>
filter, and am never bothered by them again.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not going to rule as to whether y'all can talk about geocaching,<br/>
(or anything else, for that matter), I don't really care.  No<br/>
matter what I do, someone gets pissed off and gets in my face<br/>
(after which they also get booted off the island and go in my<br/>
spam filter as well, as who has the patience for such?), so<br/>
I'll just do what I want and boot people and messages off the<br/>
island that personally annoy me :)  It is my island, after all.<br/>
<br/>
Y'all ought to be able to solve this one without my intervention.<br/>
Put it to a vote, or start another list, or put annoying people<br/>
in your spam filter are a few possible solutions.  The list<br/>
charter remains as Don quoted.  Y'all can do the semiosis on it :)<br/>
<br/>
As an FYI, I will point out, that long before geocaching came along,<br/>
some letterboxes had GPS coordinates as clues.  I don't recall<br/>
anyone getting up in arms about it, tho it was a long time ago,<br/>
and my memory has been allocated to more important trivia.<br/>
<br/>

Maybe I am dense, but why did you post the description?  There is a <br/>
reason behind it, you didn't just do it because you were bored.  So <br/>
don't give me the whole innocent act.  You didn't like what was being <br/>
talked about, event though it was slightly on topic, so you wanted <br/>
people to shut up about it.  You can't just move the thread and kill it <br/>
here, you don't have the power to do so, and I think that bothers you too.<br/>

stop acting like it.<br/>
