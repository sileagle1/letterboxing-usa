&gt;  As an echo ..I tried to send a message to our SNU member...<br/>
&gt;  ...and it bounced (twice) I just assumed it<br/>
&gt;  was my server..Is there something I should know. ?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  I read (I think it was Mitch said) that emails were scrambled to avoid<br/>
&gt;  spam...<br/>
&gt;  Is this why ?<br/>
<br/>
Dear Mary, Graham, and others:<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Graham is right.  The email addresses that appear on the discussion group<br/>
archive are disguised to prevent people from using it to gather email<br/>
addresses for distribution of unsolicited junk messages (aka ''spam'').<br/>
<br/>
The addresses that are shown will have a dash ( - ) in place of the letter<br/>
right before the @ sign.<br/>
<br/>
Provisions are made for contact of list members, but in order to do this, you<br/>
must be registered with Egroups.  Instructions for registering are included in<br/>
our Frequently Asked Questions list at  http://www.pclink.com/elf/faq.txt<br/>
<br/>
Registration is free and does not subject you to spam from Egroups, or<br/>
anything like that.  It will also allow you to view the entire list of<br/>
members, and modify your membership profile.<br/>
<br/>
I've noticed that the individual messages I recieve from the list include the<br/>
actual email address of the person who sent it.  I'm not sure if this is<br/>
because I'm registered or if all of us recieve this info.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps you understand the problems you've had, and that you can<br/>
accept the inconvenience as a small price to pay for the state-of-the-art<br/>
protection from junk email that this service provides.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mitch<br/>
