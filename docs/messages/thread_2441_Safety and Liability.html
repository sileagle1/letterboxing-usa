                    <div class="plaintext-content">This issue has been of concern to many (myself included) since the <br/>
first days of letterboxing in the US. A few months ago, with input <br/>
from several members of this list, I was working on a letterboxing <br/>
database that would have made it extremely easy for folks to post and <br/>
edit their own clues. We were discussing the issues on another list. <br/>
The closer I got to getting it finished, the more nervous I got about <br/>
my personal liability for providing such a service. Ultimately, I <br/>
wimped out and decided it just wasn't worth it, and abandoned the <br/>
project. I have worked too hard for what I have to open myself up to <br/>
such problems.<br/>
<br/>
The webmasters who run the LBNA site are providing a great service to <br/>
the community. They have more guts than I do. I  take responsibility <br/>
for my own clues and always try to be as clear as I can about safety <br/>
issues. I would suggest that everyone else posting clues and caring <br/>
about their personal finances consider the issue carefully. The only <br/>
real possible way to try to completely insulate yourself from such <br/>
problems would be to post clues anonymously with no personal <br/>
identifying info. However you probably still could be tracked down if <br/>
something went horribly amiss.<br/>
<br/>
No one can make everyone else conform to what they think should be <br/>
the standard of disclosure regarding safety/difficulty of boxes. I <br/>
think the best way is for those of us who care to only search for <br/>
boxes when that information is made available by the box owner. No <br/>
one can protect us from ourselves, or unusual acts of nature <br/>
(accidents) but I want to know what I am getting into before I start <br/>
out.<br/>

Maybe it is still there.  Never really saw a multi-trunked live oak,<br/>
although we searched every tree where we thought it might be.  We must not<br/>
have been in the right spot.  Next time I get to St. Pete, I will try again<br/>
and let you know.<br/>
