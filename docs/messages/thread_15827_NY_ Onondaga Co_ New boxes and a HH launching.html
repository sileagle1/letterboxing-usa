THE ACE OF CLUBS micro-box **<br/>
<br/>
There are others in this series and on this trail for a total of 6<br/>
boxes placed by us.<br/>
Placed 8/31/03  by: catbead, The Fly Doc and their trusty friend The<br/>
Mollusk<br/>
<br/>
BIG SLICK AND THE ACE OF CLUBS micro-box<br/>
<br/>
Pick up the trail from THE ACE OF SPADES<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Big Slick walked on after collecting the Ace of Spades and became<br/>
aware that a front must have come through because the humidity had<br/>
blown away and it felt so much better, not as sticky as before.  He<br/>
walked until he could see campers &amp; tents and could hear voices from<br/>
the campground.  Someone broke out a violin and an Irish tune rolled<br/>
sweetly through the evening air, and somewhere a grill was smelling<br/>
good.  He crossed a little ravine with an ancient oak that reminded<br/>
him of the giant sequoias he had seen in California, only not as big.<br/>
 Keeping the campground to his right, it began to curve farther away<br/>
as he walked.  A chain link fence was a little ways off on the left<br/>
and far below was the emerald green lake.<br/>
<br/>
As he approached the end of the fence the landscape before him stopped<br/>
him in his tracks.<br/>
'What the . . . !'   He could not believe what he saw.  A central<br/>
valley ran through earth that no<br/>
longer resembled what he had just passed through.  The terrain now had<br/>
a lumpy bumpy<br/>
tossed up personality, and how all this fit into such a small area was<br/>
beyond his comprehension.  'Do doooo do doooo, do doooo do doooo, you<br/>
are now entering the Twilight Zone ran through his head as he stared<br/>
trying to figure which path to take.  'Dalliance had been coy with<br/>
this one'  he thought.<br/>
<br/>
"Many paths travel here and cross them all, you will.  For what<br/>
you<br/>
want will lead you straight and thru." Dalliance had said.<br/>
<br/>
'Sheesh, she sounds like Yoda ' he thought to himself.  He wondered if<br/>
it was possible for her to ever say something straight out, without<br/>
jumbling it up and making it sound like a big mystery.<br/>
<br/>
Trying not to slip down the hill, Big Slick followed this trail as it<br/>
led over an old log carved with names of past visitors.  Past the<br/>
steep valley leading down to the left, he found himself staring at a<br/>
tree coming up on the left.  'That's one of the ugliest maples<br/>
I've<br/>
ever seen', he thought as he stepped closer, 'thing's got big<br/>
nasty<br/>
bumps,'  his eyes traveled higher.  'WHoaH! Is that . . . a. .<br/>
.HAND!?'   The thing rose up pointing to the heavens, a giant pale<br/>
left hand rising from where the maple divided in two.  Slick stared in<br/>
absolute amazement 'ain't Mother Nature strange'  he thought<br/>
'giving<br/>
us the fickle finger of fate.'   Pulling himself away from this<br/>
oddity, he traveled on down the path.  The lake was below on his left.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, off to his right he saw two long logs that looked like they were<br/>
sledding down hill end to end.  Shaking his head, his eyes landed on<br/>
another oddity, again on the right.  He could see<br/>
that this tree was strangely misshapen, for the first few feet the<br/>
trunk was a little too fat and the opposite side of it was eaten away<br/>
by insects.  'Strange '  he thought 'what was it she said "From<br/>
this<br/>
one take 21........little paces to the laces"??? '   "Now<br/>
that makes a<br/>
lot of sense!"  He said out loud.  "So I've got this<br/>
buggy maple and<br/>
I'm suppose to take 21 little paces...OK..., must mean<br/>
Dalliance's<br/>
girly steps again..."  Big slick was now talking out loud to<br/>
himself,<br/>
who else could hear him?  So he made himself busy counting off his<br/>
girly steps, staying alert, but he almost tripped on a root that grew<br/>
into the path, luckily he saw it first.<br/>
<br/>
He stopped and rested with his back to the large maple tree growing by<br/>
the path, and by doing<br/>
so his back was to the lake far below.  Staring across the path and<br/>
into the tall woods he<br/>
noticed some downed trees and a big snarl of monster vines.  This took<br/>
him back to his childhood where he would dream with the TV on, and in<br/>
the shadows and darkened room he would become Tarzan, swinging from<br/>
the trees and saving the helpless, aided by the only friends he could<br/>
trust with his life.<br/>
<br/>
"Two laces cross this root, read 262, then count 21." <br/>
She said.<br/>
<br/>
'Well old girl, I know you and your compass reading ability and I know<br/>
that it may or may not<br/>
be 262 '  he thought to himself.  Doing his best girly step<br/>
imitation, off he went and when he<br/>
got there he looked around and saw... not much!  'How irritating'  he<br/>
thought to himself as he<br/>
walked around nudging things with the toe of his boot and scuffing up<br/>
the forest floor.  Then<br/>
he saw something that might have promise, right where he stopped<br/>
counting at the base of a<br/>
thin maple.  Well hidden from critters under a pile of rocks and in a<br/>
little hole he found what<br/>
he wanted.  He also found the hastily written instructions for the Ace<br/>
of Hearts.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
*A note from catbead: Poor Mr. Clubs!  He's had his container<br/>
replaced<br/>
2 times in less than 2<br/>
weeks for a total of 3 new boxes!  His new hidey-hole should be safe<br/>
and I hope that sharp<br/>
toothed critter will relax now that it doesn't have to share<br/>
it's<br/>
home.  It is for this reason all my micro-boxes now have the following<br/>
note:<br/>
<br/>
**These boxes are impervious to water as long as the tops are screwed<br/>
on tight and haven't been chewed up by a critter or have a crack<br/>
running all the way through.  If you see that something has happened,<br/>
please contact me at: catbead@catbeadmischief.com or,<br/>

THE ACE OF HEARTS micro-box<br/>
<br/>
Pick up the trail from THE ACE OF CLUBS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Big Slick unfolded the paper he found crammed in with the Ace of<br/>
Clubs. On it, in Dalliance`s overly rounded handwriting were the<br/>
hastily written directions to the last Ace:<br/>
<br/>
continue = path splits = R<br/>
long log /crossed one = sit = look east<br/>
fungus-among-us / woodpecker holes = between<br/>
path = rise = tree = X = spot<br/>
<br/>
He sat on a log in the woods staring at the paper trying to make sense<br/>
of what was written on it, then stood up and slowly walked back to the<br/>
trail. He went on into the unfamiliar trail and followed the clues as<br/>
best he could. By the time he sat down Slick was beginning to believe<br/>
that Dalliance really was losing it with the weird clues and the<br/>
"fungus-among-us" business. 'Really, fungus-among-us?' He<br/>
thought. His<br/>
eyes settled on something and he snorted with laughter "I<br/>
don't<br/>
believe it!" he burst out loud. 'OK', he thought, 'that`s<br/>
good ' as he<br/>
wiped his eyes.  <br/>
<br/>
Slick rose to his feet and took the little path to the east. He found<br/>
it ended at another that hugged the rim of the steep hill looking down<br/>
on the very green Round Lake. In doing so he passed a tree set off to<br/>
the right. It had a little split running up the trunk, and to one side<br/>
was two large logs lying on the ground criss-crossed. The top one, in<br/>
a way, reminded him of an expressway overpass because it was so flat.<br/>
This interested him. Thinking it might make a good spot he walked<br/>
around to see it from another angle, a lower one. Looking closer he<br/>
thought he detected a couple of stones in the shadows underneath this<br/>
little "bridge". Getting closer Slick picked up a stick and<br/>
nudged one<br/>
of the stones away, and with it came some leaves. Reaching in with his<br/>
hand now because he could no longer contain his excitement, Slick<br/>
pushed aside another stone and pulled out the Ace of Hearts. Sitting<br/>
back on his haunches he gave out a yelp of delight. Just as he was<br/>
standing to leave, something caught his eye. It was barely visible<br/>
hidden by more leaves and had been in place behind the Ace of Hearts.<br/>
Pulling it out he found a small container with a note attached. In<br/>
Dalliance's handwriting it read:<br/>
<br/>
Dear Slick,<br/>
Catbead, The Fly Doc and their trusty friend The Mollusk have left<br/>
something special here for you to give to their friend ROC`nRON.<br/>
It<br/>
had a little party with another hitch hiker before they left, and may<br/>
show the marks from that, but otherwise it is in prime tip-top shape.<br/>
It is the final piece of the Gambler Series, called the "Blackjack<br/>
Acorn" Hitch Hiker, and needs to get out into the world. They<br/>
said Ron<br/>
would know where to take it from here to get it on its way.<br/>
<br/>
                        You are my very best big brother,            <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
