in " summer lecture series. Thurs July 25 from 12-1 Carolyn Stearns  <br/>
will be  teaching folks how to  get into letterboxing and introducing <br/>
the 300th anniversary series of boxes. A permanent box at the muesam <br/>
will be introduced and an event stamp will be available. Clues to  <br/>
new 300 th boxes will be available.  Bring your sandwich, drinks and <br/>
desserts provided. There are also wonderful exhibits at this little <br/>
historical society muesam.  The 300th letterboxes all pertain to <br/>
historic events or places in mansfield history and this event will <br/>
show how letterboxing can teach a little histoy while having fun.  We <br/>
hope to get lots of new letterboxers from the event.  Notice will be <br/>
in the hartford Courant calendar as well as the Chronicle from <br/>
Willimantic.  The Mansfield Historical Society newsletter also <br/>
carries a stry about the event. All are welcome.    Leader of the Pack<br/>
