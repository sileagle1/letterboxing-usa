                    <div class="plaintext-content">aah, the box that plays hard to get.  The Diva and I had one in  my town that <br/>
we couldn't find one week while she was here.  I promised I  wouldn't look <br/>
for it until she came back.  Months later we found that  sucker and laughed our <br/>
heads off.  You know, they all seem so obvious after  you find them.  It about <br/>
killed me to drive by it everyday without driving  in to the park for a peek, <br/>
but I kept my word.  We now have one in her home  town eluding us, and we <br/>
have made the same promise.  Frankly, I just want  her to have that sweet <br/>
suffering I experienced.  Hehehehehe.  It  really does make the find all that more <br/>
glorious.  That's my story and I'm  sticking to it!  Obviously, she doesn't have <br/>
access to this list, so if she  finds out...<br/>

a happy boxer<br/>
