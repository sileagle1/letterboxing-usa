and me.<br/>
      Thank you Newbe1 and Dayze(with baby Newbe2), for organizing a <br/>
most enjoyable get together. <br/>
      Thank you Healwar for listing all who attended including Celtic <br/>
Pride. What a determined bunch they are! It was so nice of them to <br/>
share their logbook with Pacific NW stamps. OK, yeah you have good <br/>
carvers (some of us are as good ie; Healwar, Sarah #3 ADG, Renee <br/>
Boxitup, Celtic Pride,and Firefly) But we hold the bragging rights to <br/>
beautiful logbooks courtesy of an excellent teaching lesson from <br/>
Sarah. <br/>
      Squirrel you were greatly missed. We are going to plan a fall <br/>
get-together. Somewhere more convenient for you.<br/>
      I believe Mountain Scorpia deserves special recognition as she <br/>
travelled the farthest. She will be hosting a meet/greet in NC soon. <br/>
Very energetic lady!<br/>
      Thank you Ladybug for picking up Legere de Maines Traveller. A <br/>
beautiful stamp! <br/>
       We exchanged stamps, ate, had lessons in compass readings(I <br/>
still need help, never did care for math or anything involving <br/>
numbers) and making logbooks(fun, cut and paste I can do). Then <br/>
everyone scattered to go boxing. Ladybugs Pocahontas Series wore <br/>
Turtle out. She just plopped down on the trail and cried I CAN'T GO <br/>
ON. Boy, was I happy to hear that! I was just trying to keep up with <br/>
her. The Turtle averaged our 4 out of 6 finds to 1 and 1/2 hours per <br/>
box. Our feet hurt!!!! Then I had a 3 hour drive back home.<br/>
      At the last box I caught a frog. I wanted to bring it back for <br/>
Tammy #1 ADG, but it peed on my clue list and squealed. So back in <br/>
the rotting stump he went. My Snakey, Snake charming perfume wasn't <br/>
working too well. I probably let my prince go!<br/>
      We left at 7:30 for the drive home. My feet hurt so bad that I <br/>
pulled over, took off my shoes and read the manual for cruse control. <br/>
Much better! No boxing today. This will be a happy memory! The End<br/>
