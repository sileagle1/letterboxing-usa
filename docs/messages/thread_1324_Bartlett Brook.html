Now  my son has a question , someone signed the book with concern for <br/>
protecting the historical integrity of the site, and I agree and also <br/>
think our group is not likely to  endanger any site.The question is <br/>
when did the house burn or come down do you know why? I am assuming <br/>
it was the Bartlett family homestead.  It is a wonderful place and <br/>
leaves us now p12f1 thank you. 4-H leader and the western. Also note <br/>
we picked up Home is Where the Heart is- Hitchiker who was one of our <br/>
own we plan to plant him again tommorow. It made my son so happy to <br/>
see it had been moved . We loved all the stamps we saw here today!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not aware of any historical background to the foundation. It is <br/>
actually one of a few located there. I will try to find out any <br/>
history that I can as I live right here in Lebanon. In fact I will <br/>
take a walk out there tomorrow to read the concerns for myself. I <br/>
will also check with the DEP, as it was their maps that I used. By <br/>
the way, you can get trail maps to most of the state parks and <br/>
forests at the DEP offices. I use the one on Route 66 in Marlborough. <br/>
You know the place, the Smokey the Bear sign.<br/>
<br/>
Are you from Mansfield? I grew up there and my mother still lives <br/>
there. I knew some members of the Stearns family.<br/>
