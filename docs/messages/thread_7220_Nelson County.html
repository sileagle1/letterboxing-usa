just to add...<br/>
while we we scurring furiously around this outcropping, some kind of <br/>
church field-trip beat us to the top and retrieved the box from <br/>
somewhere. none of the 27 eight to 16 year olds admitted to FINDING <br/>
the box, to i tiredly stuffed it into a small cluster of brush about <br/>
top center. if someone would like to replace it WHERE IT BELONGS.... <br/>
that would be great, im sure i put it in the wrong place. but i dont <br/>
think this place gets much traffic from overactive teenagers, so it <br/>
should be fine for a few months. <br/>
enjoy!<br/>
spike<br/>
<br/>
and they had no water to spare, we were stupid and didnt bring it, <br/>
thinking it was a 10 minute box....<br/>
