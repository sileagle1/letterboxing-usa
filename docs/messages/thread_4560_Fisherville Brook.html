Exeter, RI<br/>
Planted 2/24/02<br/>

 A pleasant walk through one of RI Audubon Society's gems. Several<br/>
different habitats present themselves on this trek so take your time and<br/>
enjoy! The walk is about 2.25mi over easy terrain but it can easily be<br/>
made longer or shorter. The trail map is available at the kiosk by the<br/>
parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
How To Get There<br/>
<br/>
 From Rt. 95, take Exit 5 onto Rt. 102 East. By the Town Clerk's office,<br/>
turn left onto Widow Sweets Rd. Turn right onto Pardon Joslin Rd. The<br/>
entrance and parking area are on the right hand side approximately<br/>
3/4mi.<br/>
<br/>
The Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
 At the Information Kiosk, go east along the Split Rock Trail (Orange<br/>
Blazes). Why this trail is called "Split Rock" will suddenly become<br/>
apparent as you round a bend and spy a very large rock that has been<br/>
split into three large pieces. Fields will soon open up to your left and<br/>
soon you will come upon a fallen tree along the path that has been cut<br/>
to provide a pleasant sitting area. As you pause, in the background you<br/>
may hear the sound of a waterfall. Continuing along the trail, you will<br/>
cross a small brook. Just past this, you will meet up with the Blue<br/>
Trail. Go West on the blue trail until you come to the pond. Be sure to<br/>
check the pond carefully as it is not unheard of to spot the resident<br/>
beaver. Other wildlife often frequents the pond as well. From the edge<br/>
of the bridge crossing the dam, turn north and look for a well worn<br/>
cedar tree. Turn 90degrees east and look for a break in the wall. Step<br/>
down and turn south following the wall to the waters edge. About two<br/>
feet up from the ground, look for some loose stones behind which will be<br/>
the Fisherville Brook Letterbox. Take care when retrieving as it is<br/>
right next to the trail.<br/>
 After stamping and replacing the box, continue on the blue trail around<br/>
the pond enjoying the different vistas and habitats. There's an<br/>
opportunity for a short side trip through the cedar swamp. The blue<br/>
trail will eventually bring you back to the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
