                    <div class="plaintext-content">wow! what a wonderful little walk to find these beauties. we found<br/>
only two of the three, but then with 3 kids in tow and the crossong of<br/>
the creek not too sure, we decided to only conquer two.<br/>
Lovely stamps Zara!! I know you and CSB work hard to get letterboxing<br/>
going in the Pacific Southwest(B.C)  We especially loved the logbook<br/>
for Watcher of the Woods...and we did watch out for that Devil's Club!<br/>
<br/>
The kids especially loved these ones as once we were at the<br/>
destination, they were easy to find. Woo Hoo, a wonderful bonus for<br/>
kids who have had many unsuccessful attempts.<br/>
<br/>
So you all, get out in BC and Letterbox.<br/>
