new tee shirts on, my way of trying to find an exchange,lol. When along the<br/>
path comes a father and son riding bikes. My littlest one jumped and looked<br/>
with horror at her new shirt and slaps her hand across the Lbma insignia on<br/>
the chest, realized she looked suspicious and so starts bellowing out the<br/>
National Anthem! Like that won't attract attention! Well, after she started<br/>
singing I realized what she was doing. (Picture the three of us standing<br/>
there dumbfounded, while the bicycle people go by giving us VERY strange<br/>
looks.) It took me 15 minutes to recover from the laughing attack I was<br/>
suffering from, I'm chortling now just remembering. So what do you think?<br/>
Did I stress the point that it supposed to be a secret well enough with my 5<br/>
yr old? Ahhh, kids are always good for a laugh, especially just when you<br/>
start to take yourself to seriously.<br/>

Heck, just knowing the words to the National Anthem at 5 YO is worth <br/>
a round of applause. () ( )  ()  ( )  ()  ( )<br/>
