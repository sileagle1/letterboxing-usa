I am not upset if my HH ends up at a gathering, it is nice to hear that it is still moving around, but I really prefer to have my HHs go from box to box rather than  a big table with 20 other HHs on it. I put a lot of thought in each stamp I create and it seems to me that during a gathering a feeding frenzy occurs at the HH table and people don't even remember what they have stamped. I don't stamp in to HHs at gatherings either.  In my opinion it would be like cheating myself out of the excitement of finding a HH (which is an extremely rare event in my life). Anyway like I said it doesn't upset me to have my HHs  go there but I prefer they go from box to box. I just LOVE hearing they are still "alive" and well!<br/>
