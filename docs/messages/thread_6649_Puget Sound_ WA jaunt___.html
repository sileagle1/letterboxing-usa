<br/>
Just a note to let you know the following boxes are in position &amp; in <br/>
excellent shape as of 30 July-1 August 2002:<br/>
<br/>
-Kubota Japanese Garden, Seattle, WA:  What a beautiful and little <br/>
known treasure in the city!<br/>
<br/>
Deception Pass State Park, Whidbey Island:  One of my most favorite <br/>
places on this earth!!!  Unfortunately, no orca sightings this time.<br/>
-Eagle<br/>
-Archer<br/>
-The Bridge<br/>
<br/>
-Langley, WA  What a cute little seaside village!!!<br/>
<br/>
Ft Worden State Park, Port Townsend:<br/>
-Survival Training<br/>
-Mayo<br/>
-Aviator Wings<br/>
<br/>
-Leaf<br/>
-Guardhouse (after a long hunt--this one is difficult without a <br/>
map!!!) with a hitchhiker to boot!!!  YIPPEE!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Olympic Mountains Natl Park, Hurricane Ridge, near Port Angeles:<br/>
-Hurricane Hill's "'Bear'ly the top of Hurricane Ridge"<br/>
I placed this one--not sure how long it will survive the many <br/>
destructive storms that pass through this area.  It seemed secure <br/>
enough at the time, we'll see as the storms pass through over the <br/>
seasons.<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail...<br/>

gone.  We set our little hitchhiker 'Bye Bye Birdie' from CT free <br/>
today.  :(  But, in our next box, we immediately came upon a little <br/>
geocache treasure--YIPPEE!!!  GEMS from Gem's--that was really <br/>
cool.  It's a 'pass it on' thing, too.  So, we'll have to look for <br/>
another box, soon!!!<br/>
