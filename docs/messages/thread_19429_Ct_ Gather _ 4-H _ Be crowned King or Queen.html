    To all  within the realm whom wish to seek the  title of King or<br/>
Queen of the letterboxing Realm  you are hearby invited.  <br/>
<br/>
members of the Cock-A-Doodle-Moo 4-H club invite you to attempt the<br/>
sword in stone type process to prove your worthiness in the title to<br/>
be bestowed.  Come one come all to the TOlland COunty 4- H Fair  held<br/>
on Aug 13,14,15  at the  4-H "castle"  in  Vernon ,Ct. For distance<br/>
travellers you will make your way over the  highway 84 to Exit 67.<br/>
This is for the fair town of Rockville and Rte 31. Depart the highway<br/>
here and travel toward Rockville to the light.  Turn right on Rte 30<br/>
the Faire is next to the McDonald's Clan establishment. There will be<br/>
a small parking fee to help with the various cost of running such a<br/>
great exhibition of children's 4-H projects. No further  kingly<br/>
taxation will be applied unless you ply your taste buds with <br/>
quenching libations and banquet  with us.   <br/>
     Those seeking the  title offered will be required to test their<br/>
mettle in finding a series of well placed  letterboxes of the most<br/>
knightly young carvers in 4-H.  Once showing proof of your crusade in<br/>
Letterboxing you may pose within the castle for a royal portrait.<br/>
Please bring the  camera you wish a photo on we may provide some as<br/>
well if it so suits the powers to be. The faire will be closing on<br/>
Sunday at 3 to  attempt to move all the  fair creatures of the land<br/>
back to their rightful barns. Some good servant of the realm will be<br/>
taken away by royal coach ( HH)  and you may encounter the many<br/>
interesting travellers as such attend these faires with great<br/>
regularity.  This is announced as a royal decree of the<br/>
Cock-Doodle-Moo 4-H club. Hope you can come.  Leader of the Pack<br/>
