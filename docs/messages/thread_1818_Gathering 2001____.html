Thank you all for hosting a splendiferous day in Vernon. It was so nice
to meet you. In spite of the long ride, I came away with a heightened interest
in letterboxing, and a stronger sense of its community. Winter is a great
time to hold a meet like this because when the weather is nice, I'd rather
be spending my free time out on the trails.
<br/>    Now that I've exchanged stamps with so many of you,
I'm looking forward to seeing those stamps show up in the boxes here in
PA!

Congratulations on finding 100 (I didn't realize there were a hundred<br/>

    Here I am at midnight hoping to get a glimpse of all the great folks<br/>
at the gathering today and your new page comes up - but no images!  Not<br/>
a complaint, just a disappointment.   Sounds like a great time was had<br/>

everyone for all their efforts.  (We have our first exchange stamps now!)<br/>
Oh, and by the way, what do you count the event stamp as?  Doesn't seem to<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Carolyn for an excellent day yesterday.  You thought of everything,<br/>
the event stamp (so cool!), the event boxes, hidden treasures in<br/>
letterboxes, games, and lots of time to meet other letterboxers.  We had a<br/>
great time!  Our favorite find of the day was at Shelter Falls.  We trudged<br/>
through deep snow (no one had been down the trail since the last snowstorm)<br/>
on our way to what we thought would be our 199th stamp.  When we found the<br/>
box though, there was a hitchhiker hidden behind it!  The second Bludger and<br/>
our 200th stamp!!!  On top of that when we opened the box there was another<br/>
surprise hidden inside.  A wrapped present (some hand or toe warmers)  A<br/>
great idea!!  Although we didn't see any letterboxers out on the trail, we<br/>
were psyched to meet so many of you when we got back to Ag. Center.  We<br/>
really loved meeting all of you and exchanging stamps.  It's great to know<br/>
that all the other letterboxers out there are such nice, friendly people.<br/>
We hope to see some more of you out on the trails, expecially those of you<br/>
who had to leave before we had the chance to talk (Drew Clan &amp; Ram)  I can't<br/>
wait to get together again soon.  Carolyn once again, thanks for a great<br/>
day, we hope this becomes an annual event!<br/>
