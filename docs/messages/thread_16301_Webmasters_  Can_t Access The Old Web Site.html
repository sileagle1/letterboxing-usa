permanently gone?  If not gone, what is its life expectancy?<br/>
The reason I ask is that some old clues are only available<br/>
on the old site because they included graphic images or<br/>
the old placers don't participate any more, so it would be<br/>
nice to keep them archived and available just in case.  In<br/>
fact I was thinking about having some abandoned boxes that<br/>
I know are missing in Texas deleted from the main web site<br/>
to eliminate people wasting time looking for them, but only<br/>
if the clues could remain accessible on the old site. <br/>
If you don't have the space, I understand.<br/>
