Hello!  I'm new to this forum.  I have been letterboxing for 3 <br/>
years.  Usually I stay away from chat areas, but getting more at-<br/>
wase with it.  In a couple of weeks I will be going to the Bay Area, <br/>
CA on a business trip.  Planning on going out a day early so that I <br/>
can do some letterboxing!!!!!  Then I thought that it would be <br/>
awesome to leave a Hitchhicker.  Could someone explain to me how to <br/>
go about doing this?  Thanks so much..........<br/>

Welcome to letterboxing! <br/>
<br/>
There's a smaller yahoo group for new letterboxers at<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/. Also, make sure that you<br/>
check out the letterboxing FAQ, http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html.<br/>
<br/>
A hitchhiker is usually a fairly small stamp and journal in a freezer<br/>
ziplock bag (although some HH have their own small plastic container).<br/>
All of the parts should be labelled as belonging to the hitchhiker,<br/>
like "Green Giant HH". I usually stamp the HH stamp and my personal<br/>
stamp on the first page of the journal along with the name, date<br/>
released and my e-mail address.<br/>
<br/>
You release it be finding a letterbox with room to put it inside or<br/>
next to the letterbox. There is yahoo group dedicated to dicussing and<br/>
announcing hitchhikers,<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox_travellers/. The normal<br/>
practice is to post a message where and when you find a HH but not to<br/>
post a message that says where you placed it.<br/>
