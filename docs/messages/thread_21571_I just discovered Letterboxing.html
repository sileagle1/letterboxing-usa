Quite by accident, I discovered letterboxing last week when I was <br/>
checking out a place to stay in a canyon in AZ.  After I read about <br/>
it, I was excited, it sounded like such fun.  So, my nine year old <br/>
son and I have created our log book, bought our stamps (no time to <br/>
carve, have to get started right away) and found our first 2 <br/>
letterboxes.  We hand a grand time and we are hooked!!!!  What a <br/>
fabulous hobby!  One of the only ways I could get my son to "hike"!<br/>
Have read some of the posts.  Have one question...what's <br/>
a 'hitchhiker'?<br/>

Isn't this just the greatest.  I just discovered this about 2 weeks <br/>
ago and I have found 7 boxes and placed 4.  I just love it.  My kids <br/>
also think that it is really neat.  Welcome and enjoy.<br/>
