the box, but it was open and scattered, and, alas....no stamp.  I <br/>
brought the box home with me and will be glad to send it back to Baby <br/>
Bear if contacted with the address.  I don't think it had been <br/>
scattered long, as the log book is in great shape.  Just let me know <br/>
and I'll send it right back to you for repairs.<br/>
