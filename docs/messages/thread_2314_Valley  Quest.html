What a fantastic job  these schools have done to coordinate this <br/>
hobby with the curriculum and make learning fun. I hope the students <br/>
in that area know how lucky they are. I can't wait to head north and <br/>
attempt to get the 21 required Valley Quest to earn a patch. It may <br/>
take a couple trips but thats o.k. we are certainly inspired by their <br/>
publication! <br/>

Also wanted to mention that the Good Fairy box I planted this weekend <br/>
is what I consider my best effort at carving yet. I purposly chose a <br/>
low traffic park as a form of protection for her, I'm sure fairies <br/>
prefer the safety of solitude and only the visits of friends. Hope <br/>
some of you get a chance for that enchanting walk in the woods.  <br/>

I'm rather excited to be moving to the Upper Valley.  When I was there<br/>
house-hunting, I got two of the Valley Quest boxes.  I'm looking<br/>
forward to hunting for more of them.<br/>
