I  have some inkling of the effort that goes into simply providing the<br/>
service of the website.  It is freely given and I greatly appreciate the<br/>
time and effort that goes into it!  I am not sure it would be reasonable to<br/>
ask the webmasters to police the clue site.  And, frankly, there is no<br/>
guarantee that a box placed at noon will be there at 4 pm.  There is always<br/>
some measure of uncertainty in this hobby.<br/>
<br/>
I also understand the frustrations of not finding a box, especially when you<br/>
have a young child or a new boxer along.   (I have learned to appreciate the<br/>
value of teaching my children that sometimes the journey is a darn sight<br/>
more worthwhile than getting something ;)  Take advantage of those life<br/>
lessons where you can!!)<br/>
<br/>
One suggestion I have is to try and verify the box before hunting if it is<br/>
important to you  that it be there.  I do this when traveling out of town<br/>
and have limited time to box.  I usually post on this list and also contact<br/>
individuals who have boxes listed in the area of interest.  Not only  do<br/>
they often  confirm their own boxes, but can usually tell me what other<br/>
boxes may be missing or are unusually tricky etc.  And no reply to this<br/>
request might be a good sign that those boxes should be skipped!  Another<br/>
thing I occasionally do is search the archives for sit reps.<br/>
<br/>
And in the end, take time to literally smell the rose, admire the foliage,<br/>
and identify the birdcalls.  The box is just an extra dollop of icing on a<br/>
yummy cake.<br/>
