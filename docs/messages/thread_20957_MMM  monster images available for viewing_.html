Chuck-  Thank you so much for sending Cookie Monster back to us!  We really, <br/>
REALLY enjoyed looking at all the images in the log book.  What a fantastic <br/>
idea this was and our family enjoyed it!  <br/>
Wanted to share a funny story:  at the gathering, I saw a man wearing a VA <br/>
Tech sweatshirt and being from VA myself, I decided to introduce myself.  Turns <br/>
out he and his wife were from my hometown of Vienna and one of them lived 1/2 <br/>
mile away!  Small world.  <br/>
I did see that 'Reporter at Large' came up and got some "monsters".  That <br/>
person is from my old neighborhood and we first saw their stamp while we were <br/>
letterboxing in VA.  Would have loved to have exchanged stamps w/ them.  Maybe <br/>
some day....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!  <br/>
