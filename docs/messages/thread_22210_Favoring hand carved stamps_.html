<br/>
I generally carve my own letterbox stamps.  But, I'm wondering how<br/>
much the stamp matters to most current letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, I may to go out of my way to find a stamp that's hand carved,<br/>
IF I already know that it's gorgeous.<br/>
<br/>
And, on the trail, if I can't seem to find the letterbox, I'll try<br/>
extra hard if I know that I'm looking for a box with a hand carved<br/>
stamp.<br/>
<br/>
But, when it comes to selecting boxes to find in the first place, it's<br/>
at least 95% location-location-location.  I love the chance to explore<br/>
places that are new to me.  I love the thrill of finding a challenging<br/>
letterbox.  (Or, on a very hot day here in Texas, finding ANY<br/>

I used store bought stamps in my letterboxes at first and plenty of people have come out and stamped in.  They are pathetic compared to the stamps I have seen since, but that does not seem to influence most people I have talked to.<br/>

What a lovely sentiment you express, yes indeed it is all about the<br/>
hike. Of course that's why we letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Now put down the Hallmark card and get real. If one finds a letterbox<br/>
for which the placer put forth the Herculean effort of fishing through<br/>
the pocket lint and pulling out a buck-ninety-eight to hand to the<br/>
bored, gum-snapping, blond bimbo at the ACMoore check out then they<br/>
deserve just as much effort from the finders...a big yawn. If her<br/>
Ladyship goes to all the effort to pack her Lalique stemware and Royal<br/>
Daulton into a picnic hamper and have Bartleby lug it half way up<br/>
Mount Everest not to mention risking soiling her white sling-back peau<br/>
de soie pumps there had better be a hand carved stamp in that box. How<br/>
many times have you heard someone lauded on this list for their<br/>
beautiful store bought stamps? Even if you can't carve like<br/>
Michelangelo a chewed eraser is better that something you grabbed off<br/>
a shelf stuffed into Tupperware and flung into the weeds from your car<br/>
window. If you want to evaluate your own efforts refer to my dear<br/>
sister Ivy's letterbox rating system, I believe it's on mark Pepe's<br/>

It's one thing to disdain Hallmark cards; it's a social calamity if<br/>
you don't know the hallmarks on your belongings.<br/>
<br/>
If your picnic crockery is indeed labeled 'Royal Daulton', I suggest<br/>
that you waste no time asking your housekeeper about her shopping<br/>
habits.  Your dishes sounds as if they are faux Royal Doulton.<br/>
<br/>
May I suggest that the world is a far more gracious place when we<br/>
enjoy both our Hallmarks and our hallmarks.<br/>
<br/>
I shall continue to enjoy letterboxing for the hike, with or without<br/>
the accoutrements of fine picnicking.  And, no doubt, you will enjoy<br/>
letterboxing for your own reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, much like the FAQ that I read when I first started letterboxing this response smacks of elitism and snobbery.<br/>
<br/>
I used small store bought stamps for my first hides.  The stamps were then "adjusted to fit in the container and a special logbook created to also fit as these were "micro" letterboxes.  I then spent a few hours picking just the right locations and coming up with what, in my new and inexperienced state, were good clues to make the search interesting.  This is a far cry from throwing a stamp in a Tupperware container and throwing it out the window.<br/>
<br/>
No, we don't laud people for their store bought stamps.  And this is how it should be.  The person did not create a work of art.  However the person did take the time to put together the box and place it for the enjoyment of others.  I know I have heard, maybe not on this list, people lauded for their well constructed boxes, well written clues, and clever hides.<br/>
<br/>
Are there some boxes not worth finding, of course there are.  But, I do not subscribe, for one minute, to the theory that the stamp alone determines the boxes worth.<br/>
<br/>
I really hope that I am missing something here.  I hope that your response was meant to be tongue in cheek and I just didn't get it.  Ivy's rating system is, in my mind, clearly a humorous work.<br/>
<br/>
If you are serious, I think Her Ladyship needs to realize that this activity is no longer, if it ever were, a sport of kings and lords, but an activity in which all the serfs happily partake.  We all have different priorities and judgments concerning what should or shouldn't be part of a box, and all our feelings and efforts should be appreciated and respected.<br/>
<br/>
Again, if you were not serious and I just didn't catch the wit or the sarcasm, my most humble apologies.<br/>

Perhaps you should either check your map or retake your geography class.  I am from Illinois, which, last I checked, was solidly blue on the campaign map. Now truth be told, I am a Bush suporter, however, that puts me in the minority here in Illinois.<br/>
<br/>
There is a difference, a large difference, between striving to do one's best and being an elitist.  Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses and a wise man plays to his strengths and avoids his weaknesses.  If my strength lies in the writing of clues that are literary materpieces, and the hiding of boxes that blend in with their surroundings better than a chameleon, than that is upon what I should focus.  If my weakness is the carving then that is what I should avoid.<br/>
<br/>
I still maintain that a box's worth is not based solely upon the stamp inside of it but upon the totality of the experience which it inspires.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe that American equality won out over Brittish elitism over 200 years ago.  Look where that great Empire is now.  And let us not even begin to discuss the French!  Elitism is what brought the British empire down.  A failure to recognize that others ways may be just as good or better even when they are different has destroyed many an empire.<br/>
<br/>
Again, one can strive for greatness without the arrogance that accompanies elitism.<br/>

cocktail; he does such a lovely job with the gin and tonic. <br/>

the stamp, the creativity of the logbook, the length and quality of the hike <br/>
and surrounding, even the value of looking through an almost-full logbook to <br/>
see the stamps of the others who've visited.<br/>
<br/>
And each letterboxer will assign more or less value to each element.   For <br/>
some, a hand-carved stamp is vitally important to their enjoyment, and they're <br/>
not interested in finding a box with a store-bought stamp.   For others, <br/>
they're really only interested in a box with a good, long hike, and they don't want <br/>
to be bothered with a drive-by type of box.<br/>
<br/>
And that's okay!   As others have said, not all boxes are for all boxers.   <br/>
We're all free to pick and choose which ones we want to look for!   Of course, <br/>
it's better if we try not to get offended when someone expresses an opinion <br/>
that's different from ours, too, even if it's a strongly worded opinion.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Favoring hand carved stamps?<br/>
<br/>
Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I generally carve my own letterbox stamps.  But, I'm wondering how<br/>
much the stamp matters to most current letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, I may to go out of my way to find a stamp that's hand carved,<br/>
IF I already know that it's gorgeous.<br/>
<br/>
And, on the trail, if I can't seem to find the letterbox, I'll try<br/>
extra hard if I know that I'm looking for a box with a hand carved<br/>
stamp.<br/>
<br/>
But, when it comes to selecting boxes to find in the first place, it's<br/>
at least 95% location-location-location.  I love the chance to explore<br/>
places that are new to me.  I love the thrill of finding a challenging<br/>
letterbox.  (Or, on a very hot day here in Texas, finding ANY<br/>
letterbox!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else?<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully,<br/>
Aisling<br/>

My dearest Lady Prisspott,<br/>
<br/>
It's one thing to disdain Hallmark cards; it's a social calamity if<br/>
you don't know the hallmarks on your belongings.<br/>
<br/>
If your picnic crockery is indeed labeled 'Royal Daulton', I suggest<br/>
that you waste no time asking your housekeeper about her shopping<br/>
habits.  Your dishes sounds as if they are faux Royal Doulton.<br/>
<br/>
May I suggest that the world is a far more gracious place when we<br/>
enjoy both our Hallmarks and our hallmarks.<br/>
<br/>
I shall continue to enjoy letterboxing for the hike, with or without<br/>
the accoutrements of fine picnicking.  And, no doubt, you will enjoy<br/>
letterboxing for your own reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>
most sincerely,<br/>
Countess Aisling Mason Newton MacIntosh D'Art, nee Morey<br/>

plastic boxes in the woods. . .<br/>
<br/>
Just make it clear in the posted letterbox description when a stamp <br/>
is store-bought (the default I think is hand-carved) and then <br/>
potential finders can decide for themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
My first effort at a hand-carved stamp I now think of as very <br/>
crude.  However, I was soooo proud of it at the time and have left <br/>
it in our first letterbox as a testament to that learning curve we <br/>
all have to get through.  Even if you're skeptical of your carving <br/>
abilities, give it a try.  Improvement comes quickly.<br/>

<br/>
Her Ladyship can hold herself back no longer. To use the vernacular,<br/>
get over it! <br/>
<br/>
I'm talking to the sensitive people who are afraid of a few posts on<br/>
this list serve. I've only carved one stamp for a letterbox and looked<br/>
like someone gave a grapefruit spoon and a piece of rubber to a<br/>
monkey. People who act perfect rarely are. There's no need what so<br/>
ever to be intimidated by them. Have a little spine and some self<br/>
confidence for goodness sake. As everyone said there are all kinds of<br/>
letterboxers and there will be someone that appreciates your<br/>
efforts...there will probably even be the occasional person who makes<br/>
nasty comments in your log book about the quality of your effort. I<br/>
personally discount both effusive praise and blatant<br/>
mean-spiritedness. Both are extreme reactions and therefore not likely<br/>
to be majority opinions. <br/>
<br/>
Do what makes you happy and someone will appreciate it. If you're<br/>
doing it for some twit on a list serve then you're probably going to<br/>
be disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
I know this next comment will be greeted by a chorus of people saying<br/>
it could have been said in a nicer way but it has and it hasn't<br/>
worked. People who say a comment on this list has ruined letterboxing<br/>
for them are rather childish. We've all seen a child quit in the<br/>
middle of a board game or some other competitive activity because they<br/>
are loosing; heck I've seen adults do it but it's still rather<br/>
annoying and childish behavior. This is what I hear every time someone<br/>
says that someone was mean and they're leaving. Why is it so hard to<br/>
brush it off and move on. If it's really about the hike, the artistic<br/>
expression, the beautiful location or the clever clues then why on<br/>
earth would some snotty comment from some pretentiou, pompous jerk<br/>
change any of those reasons? Try to remember that this list might be<br/>
about letterboxing but letterboxing isn't about this list.<br/>
<br/>
Make boxes that make you happy and for crying out loud don't make them<br/>
for me or any other loud-mouthed opinionated lunatic on a list serve.<br/>

Well said.  I think that a lot of people would do well to remember <br/>
this -- it is not about this list and it is not about the people or <br/>
the things they do.  It is not about that one snotty person who didn't <br/>
like your clues or your stamp, it is not about the jerk who made you <br/>
feel like an imbecile because you couldn't follow his clues and find <br/>
the box, it is not about that don't-know-any-better new boxer who <br/>
placed a box less than 3 feet from your super cool mystery box and <br/>
gave away your clues in the process...<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is about what you want it to be about.  If you are in it <br/>
for the hand-carved stamps, then look for boxes that specify such or <br/>
learn to know who the awesome carvers are; if you are in it for the <br/>
hiking, then choose boxes with a decent hike and spend a day walking <br/>
up the side of a mountain or through a lush forest; if you are in it <br/>
for the history, there are boxes for you too...  Not choosing to look <br/>
for somebody's box because it does not satisfy your interests is not <br/>
being a snob -- it is simply getting out of a hobby what you <br/>
personally want from it.  On the other hand, just because a box <br/>
doesn't meet your interest is not reason to criticize it either.  Take <br/>
the ones you want and leave the others for somebody else.  Just <br/>
because they don't knock your socks off, doesn't mean they aren't <br/>
exactly what floats the boat for the next guy.<br/>
<br/>
