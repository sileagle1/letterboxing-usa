What is WRONG with this list and LBNA tracking page for HH<br/>
??????????????????????????<br/>
<br/>
I for one will continue to post HH info to this list only. Now if the groups<br/>
wants to actually go through the motions and discussion to break it out fine<br/>
but it looks to me we have a few that feel the need to fix something that<br/>
IMO isn't broken. The end result is information splattered here and there<br/>
and even more confusion for the newbies. I still don't get it, care to<br/>
explain?<br/>
<br/>
Just my soap box, if you don't agree you can always go down the street and<br/>
listen to that guy.<br/>

list you want. Many people maintain websites regarding letterboxing, <br/>
there is the LbNA site, Letterboxing International, Letterboxing <br/>
Central and a whole lot more. We aren't competing, we're <br/>
complimenting.<br/>
<br/>
You, and every other individual on the list, is entitled to an opinion <br/>
regarding hitchhikers. There were just a few of us who wished to avoid <br/>
being slammed for posting on that particular subject. All you have to <br/>
do is read the archives to see what we mean. Besides, Wanda simply <br/>
mentioned that there IS another site, no rule about having to utilize <br/>
it.<br/>

We certainly had no intention of competing with any existing<br/>
letterboxing websites.  In fact, we would really prefer to have just<br/>
been able to add to the existing page, if that had been an option. <br/>
What with all the recent loud complaints we just thought it might be<br/>
better to remove the tracking hitchers problem from the sight of those<br/>
that it offended.  I certainly didn't need all the extra work and<br/>
aggravation.<br/>
