<br/>
If you have not already responded with a definative yes but think you are interested in T-shirts I need your answer now. Several folks have said they have to check with their team, etc. and would get back to me. I have to do a final tally and decide how many shirts I am willing to buy personally to try to reach 75 peices. Last time I counted we were at around 40. I think we're about 45 now but haven't recounted. So, if you have not yet made up your mind, now is the time. All of the info is posted in the files section of your talk list under LBMA T-Shirts. I will be sending everyone who already has ordered an email sometime tomorrow letting them know where we stand. PLEASE, respond off list. Thanks!<br/>
