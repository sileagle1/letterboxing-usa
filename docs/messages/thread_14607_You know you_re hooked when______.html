Imagine if you will, the following conversation..........<br/>
<br/>
Her - "Look there honey.... It's 5 acres."<br/>
Him - "That's nice."<br/>
Her - "And it's got a shop already on it!"<br/>
Him - "That's nice."<br/>
Her - "Wait! A shop AND a garage. 2 car garage."<br/>
Him - "That's nice."<br/>
Her - "I'll bet you it's big enough to have a horse or two on it baby!"<br/>
Him - "That's nice."<br/>
Her - "It's got 2 full bathrooms and a dishwasher!"<br/>
Him - "That's nice"<br/>
Her - "Well, well.... Look at this...."<br/>
Him - "What?"<br/>
Her - "It's a 1/4 mile from the entrance to Rainbow Falls State park. With 7.5 miles of walking trails and 10 miles of equestrian trails."<br/>
Him - "State Park? Trails?"<br/>
<br/>
The sound of keys on a keyboard being typed fast ensues and then.......<br/>
<br/>
Him - "Woohoo! Look at this, NO boxes are planted there! It's virgin territory!"<br/>
Her - "That's nice."<br/>
Him - "Oh yes! Lets buy the place!!!!!"<br/>
Her - "Yes dear!"<br/>
