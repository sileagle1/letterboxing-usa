                    <html><body>Hi:<br/>
<br/>
There are two new 'official' DEP letterboxes on Connecticut's State Forests.  The first is in Watertown, in Litchfield County, in Mattatuck State Forest.  Clues can be found at:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.dep.state.ct.us/burnatr/forestry/centen/mattatuck.htm">http://www.dep.state.ct.us/burnatr/forestry/centen/mattatuck.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
The second is in Newtown, in Fairfield County, is in Paugussett State Forest and clues can be found at:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
By the way, a question.  We have been including forest information within the clues ~ items about forest history, for instance, or indications of recent forestry activity.  We have been doing this because putting out these letterboxes is a part of our effort to celebrate the 100th anniversary of our first state forest (an event we are justifiably proud of), and because we feel this is a real opportunity to explain something about what we do.  How are these information pieces working out?  Do folks read them?  Enjoy them?  Let us know ~ you can e-mail back to me, or put it in the list-serve, or reach the Division directly at the following address - dep.forestry@po.state.ct.us<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the feedback.<br/>
