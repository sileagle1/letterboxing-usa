<br/>
being that I am in the traveling medical field, I will be in many states.<br/>
<br/>
I would be very interested in planting boxes, but would never be able to <br/>
maintain them after the assignment is over<br/>
<br/>
would it be acceptable to plant the boxes, and then ask for someone to adopt <br/>
it, or find someone to adopt the box first, then plant it?<br/>
<br/>
thanks for any advice<br/>
<br/>
so as not to clog the list with to many replys... i will wait a few days, <br/>
then send one big thank you for anyone who replys with suggestions<br/>

Hi Sinna,<br/>
Gwen &amp; I leave several letterboxes in our wake when we are tugging <br/>
our trailer around. We try to contact Letterboxers in the areas <br/>
where we stop, but even if we do not, we end up planting some boxes. <br/>
In areas that do not have an abundance of letterboxes this tends <br/>
to "salt" the area. In other areas that have a few boxes, it gives a <br/>
local letterboxer something to go for. We haven't had to have anyone <br/>
officially adopt a letterbox, and have had some go missing. <br/>
Sometimes we advise that it is an orphan, but generally folks <br/>
replace logbooks when full, or replace a baggy when it is ness. When <br/>
the box goes missing you should make sure that info is added to the <br/>
clue page. We are currently figuring out if we are going to retire <br/>
some boxes or see if we have an opportunity to replace. Just <br/>
remember it would be a sinna if you didn't planta.<br/>
<br/>

Retreating from the groans<br/>
