with the kids about good places to hide them, so hopefully there will be a<br/>
couple for you to find too (no guarantees tho, but I'm working on them).<br/>
They were pretty excited to hear that you were planning to plant some while<br/>
you were visiting, and I'll bring some along when I go, but it will probably<br/>
be another year before I can head out.  It would be nice if this would get<br/>
things kick started out there.  The locals are generally very outdoorsy<br/>
people, they just have never heard of letterboxing.  Geocaching is big in<br/>
the area, but they thought my little book of stamps was a lot nicer memento<br/>
than a collection of cache trash.  ;&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I see that the boxes already there are on National park/historic land,<br/>
so it's I wonder if they're even still in existence.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if I can just convince my Mom to take a few boxes to the Bahamas with<br/>
her this winter....<br/>
