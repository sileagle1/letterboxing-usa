Hill of Kings.An ancient site outside of Dublin Ireland that holds <br/>
history and secrets dating back over 5,000 years.It is in danger of <br/>
being run-through due to the proposed M3 Motorway for the short term <br/>
profit of a few politicians.The devastation to this amazing part of <br/>
history however, will be permanent.A LBing friend brought Tara to my <br/>
attention when I sent them my Celtic series and they planted the boxes <br/>
at the fairy tree on the Hill.I have been spreading the word to save <br/>
Tara ever after since I will be visting Ireland in a few years and <br/>
would like to see Tara in its unbulldozed state.To learn more and help <br/>
stop this travesty visit TaraWatch.org or thier Myspace page here;<br/>
