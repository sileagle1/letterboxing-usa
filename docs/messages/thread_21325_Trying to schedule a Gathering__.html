Depending on when it is, it's a possibilty for me and my kids.  My <br/>
sis lives in the vicinity of Boston ( I am from CT )and we have her <br/>
into letterboxing.  It would be a good day trip to visit her and get <br/>
some boxing down.  But with 3 young kids all in different activites, <br/>
it would depend onwhen it  is.  <br/>

more people show up.<br/>
