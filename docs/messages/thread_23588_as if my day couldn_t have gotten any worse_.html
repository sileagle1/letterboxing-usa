and because they are active on the trail and on the board and <br/>
Letterboxing is a significant part of many people's lives here, well, <br/>
it counts.  If nothing else from the human caring standpoint and he <br/>

&gt; Well, I guess it is similar to things within the homeschooling <br/>

&gt; is a lifestyle, therefore just about anything applies.  Within the <br/>
&gt; Letterboxing community, something like this affects someone deeply <br/>
&gt; and because they are active on the trail and on the board and <br/>
&gt; Letterboxing is a significant part of many people's lives here, well, <br/>
&gt; it counts.  If nothing else from the human caring standpoint and he <br/>
&gt; knew he could go here for support.<br/>

&gt; Imagine if you were in his shoes and wanted to let your friends know <br/>
&gt; you had just been dealt a severe blow in life......  I did send my <br/>

sure it is.  But Rocky would deserve a box his own.<br/>

Your cat was a member of your family and I can understand that. Just do one day at a time. Thats about all you can do. A letterbox dedicated to Rocky is an excellent idea. Hang in there. My thoughts are with you.....Chuck <br/>
