You are the first person I've heard from who has visited the Bear &amp; Berry<br/>
box.  I didn't think it was getting any action!  Have you been to the other<br/>
box site at Oak Bay?  I wish I could have placed more boxes in Victoria.<br/>
There are so many wonderful places.. My friend and I were only visiting B.C.<br/>
so our boxes there are orphans.  If you have a chance to revisit the box<br/>
could you please add another log book?  I would be most grateful.  We carry<br/>
extra boxes, baggies and books when we go boxing just in case a box needs<br/>
maintaining.  Hope you are having a good vacation.  Regards, Gwen<br/>
