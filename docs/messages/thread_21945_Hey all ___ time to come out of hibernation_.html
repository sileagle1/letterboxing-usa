                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey there fellow letterboxers!  Long time no chat, huh?  Well, time<br/>
for me to poke my sleepy head out of my hibernation den and get out<br/>
there and box!<br/>
<br/>
As those of you in the "inner-circle" know, I pretty much stopped<br/>
boxing after my GF and boxing partner and I broke up last October.  A<br/>
quick trip to the Mystery Gathering was my swan song of sorts, but I<br/>
never intended to be gone permanently.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike a lot of you, however, I've never been overly keen on boxing by<br/>
myself -- it's just not a part of my personality (I always prefer the<br/>
company of others).  But thanks to Warrior Woman, whom I've managed to<br/>
stay in touch with over the winter months, here I am back again!<br/>
<br/>
I've been eager to hit the trails, but I bought a condo in April, so<br/>
that month was rather hectic.  However, yesterday I finally connected<br/>
with Warrior Woman and we headed out to do some RI boxes!! <br/>
All-in-all, including some hitchhikers and other non-standard boxes, I<br/>
picked up 16 stamps to start my 2005 letterbox season!  I'll be<br/>
updating the list on my website<br/>
(http://home.comcast.net/~scott.e.hall/letterbox.html) tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
But, I still am shy about boxing alone, so if any of you guys in New<br/>
England are interested in having someone tag along, I'd love to!  I'm<br/>
also headed back to western NY for the next two weekends -- and<br/>
looking to hook up with some letterboxers there for some Finger Lakes<br/>
hunts!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'll stop by these boards from time-to-time.  Looking forward<br/>
to the next gathering, and getting back in touch with the letterboxing<br/>
community!<br/>
<br/>
See ya on the trails!<br/>

Ah yes, it must be spring here in New England! Welcome back to boxing<br/>
land. Good to see you back. I never box alone - unless it is a box<br/>
that I'd like to plant that requires stealth placement. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, happy spring!<br/>
