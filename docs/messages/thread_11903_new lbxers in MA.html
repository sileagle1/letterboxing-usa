My girl and I just went on our first letterboxing outing yesterday in <br/>
the Concord/Lexington area. What a brilliant excuse to get outside <br/>
and go rambling in parts that otherwise you may simply drive by or <br/>
completely miss! What a feeling to lift up that first rock and find <br/>
the white Rubbermaid staring back at you! Needless to say we had a <br/>
blast.<br/>
<br/>
I've been lurking on the list for a couple of weeks now, while we <br/>
carved our stamps and prepared our "kits" (and waited for that big <br/>
yellow thing in the sky to show itself). We're looking forward to <br/>
adding to the list of boxes locally as well as making weekend trips <br/>
to the surrounding states to find more. <br/>
<br/>
See you around,<br/>

Hi Steve,<br/>
<br/>
Just to let you know, if you want to increase your "found" count in a <br/>
very short few hours, I have several letterboxes within one or two <br/>
miles of each other:<br/>
<br/>
Tangled Woods<br/>
Hunter's Falls<br/>
Angel's Lookout<br/>
<br/>
Not far from these boxes is another letterbox (not one of mine):<br/>
<br/>
Bonsai<br/>
<br/>
A little farther out are my:<br/>
<br/>
Marathon<br/>
Peace on Earth<br/>
<br/>
Right near Peace on Earth is another letterbox (not one of mine):<br/>
<br/>
Walk up Reservation<br/>
<br/>
And in the general vicinity, there is a four box trail (also not one <br/>
of mine):<br/>
<br/>
Forever Friends<br/>
<br/>
All of these letterboxes *are* there.<br/>
<br/>
Some days it's fun to drive all day, hike all day, just to snag one <br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Other days it's nice to drive a short distance, do all driveby or <br/>
walkup boxes, and snag a ton of stamps with very little effort.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
<br/>

Thanks for the tips WW and the confirmation that the boxes are there. <br/>
We look forward to seeing your stamps!<br/>
<br/>
We tried to find Beaver Brook today but it appears to still be <br/>
missing as the note at the bottom of the clues states. Got some other <br/>
good stamps in the Belmont/Watertown area (including a bonus box!).<br/>
<br/>
Honking geese and chirping frogs were out in full force in the woods <br/>
of New England...what a beautiful spring day!<br/>
