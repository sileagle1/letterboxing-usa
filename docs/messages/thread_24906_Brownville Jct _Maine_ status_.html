oops! Our family is "On The Corner!" I see I didn't do the date right<br/>
thanks to your note :) fixed now to read July 11, 2008 Attempted.<br/>

I think I emailed him but the LbNA site has taken me longer to figure<br/>
out. So, not sure now! I posted here since the LbNA picture linked to<br/>
this forum. Hoped "Ron" was still around? <br/>
<br/>
It was a great walk down a trail we would not have hiked Friday, had I<br/>
not stumbled across his Mystery Picture clue and suspected where it<br/>
was.  We usually hike the shortcut trail farther in without river<br/>
crossings!<br/>

Try this<br/>

<br/>
I don't know if the short rich text links work if I send the email<br/>
directly to you rather than the list.<br/>
I found the picture by clicking Northern Maine region on LbNA site...<br/>
Almost There ...planted by Ron ...Brownville Jct.<br/>
<br/>
I think the box is gone but we had a great day!<br/>
<br/>
Are you a compass expert?  Which direction do you think it would have<br/>
been :)<br/>
