Dear Madam,<br/>
  I am most shocked and dismayed by your usage of the vulgar <br/>
term "schmuck". I do trust that you know what part of a male's <br/>
anatomy this term refers to??((tsk, tsk))After all, my dear Ms. <br/>
Priss, we are a family oriented group full of lollipop toting tots <br/>
and rosy cheeked babes in robust mothers' and fathers' arms. Not to <br/>
mention  many a faithful Fido too!! Yes, my dear, we all slip now and <br/>
then. I do trust this inappropriate language will not appear in any <br/>
future public postings.<br/>

In her defense, I have never heard that.  To me it has<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just to clear up a little misconception:<br/>
<br/>
Schmuck, a Yiddish word, has a range of meaning depending on context. In<br/>
its most innocuous use, a schmuck is a person who does a stupid thing,<br/>
in which case "dumb schmuck" is the appropriate expression.<br/>
<br/>
A schmuck's behavior ranges from pesky and inconsiderate, to obnoxious<br/>
and manipulative. A schmuck's personality type ranges from jerk to<br/>
bastard.<br/>
<br/>
Schmucky behavior also falls within a range of intentionality. Some<br/>
schmucks carefully plan their bad behavior, some only a little, and some<br/>
not at all. For example, the bastard may spend considerable time<br/>
planning his bad deeds. In contrast, the dumb schmuck and the pesky<br/>
behave badly without any forethought.<br/>
<br/>
So with that said... the only person that has mention male parts is<br/>
well.you get my drift.<br/>
<br/>
Given I don't know eather one of you so I just hate when people think<br/>
someone is in the wrong when they have not done their research on the<br/>
definition of the word.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like a list of proper or improper names for male parts I<br/>
will provide that to you via private e-mail only.<br/>
