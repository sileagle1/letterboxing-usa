and bearings for #1 took us to a cleared campsite minus the trees <br/>
shown in your photo clue.  Is it possible that that site has been <br/>
added since the box was first planted?  From the two rocks we stood <br/>
between...22 steps in the direction of the solved compass bearing <br/>
took us to waters edge.<br/>
<br/>
Retracing our steps to the resting spot of reflection led us right to <br/>
#2.  Within #2 we found 2 stamps.  My guess is that the stamp of Box <br/>
1 may have been relocated to its current spot.  Jay, have you gotten <br/>
any information about these stamps?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, received some good news from Pete and Wanda from RI.  They <br/>
recently stamped in to my Buck Hollow box and found it a little <br/>
singed, but otherwise intact.  No mention of Jolly G-Man's Howling in <br/>
Buck Hollow Box, so I'm wondering if they stamped in there?<br/>
