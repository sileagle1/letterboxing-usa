<div>Wendy,  We revisited box (3rd time ) Sunday 
3/25 and found secondary location</div>
<div>this time.  Alas, box top had hole in it and book ruined with standing water.  
We dried out as best we could but box and book will have to be replaced.  
Stamp was there and is lovely.  Perhaps 
a close by but different location would be better for a home.  On our way 
out, Don spied some trash by cement block and found 20 stashed beers of a 24 
pack that someone had left.  That is some geocache!  We have visited 
Palos Verdes so often we consider it a favorite hike now.  Regards, Don and Gwen.</div></body></html>

Don and Gwen,</span></div>

<div><span class="930500405-27032001">I'm 
so glad you have been enjoying the hike and that you found the second box.  
I was flabergasted when I discovered this spot after growing up in the area and 
having no idea this beautiful spot existed.  Anyway, thanks for the news on 
the second box.  I'll definitely find a better spot for the second box (and 
use sturdier boxes, I guess the ziplock didn't work as a secondary barrier to 
water), thanks for the advice. (I'm really glad you like the stamp).  
I guess I need to hide more boxes in that area for you to 
find.</span></div>
