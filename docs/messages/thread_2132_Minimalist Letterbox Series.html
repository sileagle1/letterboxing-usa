                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have a few different letterboxes in the works but have been <br/>
planning this series for over a month.  We were just waiting for the <br/>
right occasion to plant them.  The time is now for in a few short <br/>
hours it will be April Fool's Day.  <br/>
<br/>
This is our tongue in cheek attempt to add a little of our bizarre <br/>
humor to an otherwise entertaining sport.  I hope you enjoy finding <br/>
our boxes in this series as much as we enjoyed thinking them up.<br/>
<br/>
The Minimalist Letterboxes can be found at the Beaver River Preserve <br/>
in Richmond, RI.  For those that have never been there before you <br/>
will notice one feature of the area being repeated over and over in <br/>
my description... boulders, large rocks, and more boulders.  There <br/>
are only so many ways that you can describe them.  Personally, I <br/>
think that it should have boulder in the name, as the Beaver River <br/>
only runs through a small portion of the preserve.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, enjoy our weak attemp at humor as you stroll throughout the <br/>
boulder strewn (riddled, scattered,etc.) sanctuary.<br/>

should plan on wearing waterproof boots or getting their feet wet.  <br/>
Some of the trails bear marked resemblance to stream beds after all <br/>
the recent rain.<br/>

I guess that you weren't kidding about the amount of water on the <br/>
trail or large rocks.  Enjoyed your quote by Heidegger and the <br/>
accompanying stamp.<br/>
