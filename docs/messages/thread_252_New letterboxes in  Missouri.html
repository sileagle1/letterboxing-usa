&gt;INTRODUCTING NEW LETTERBOXES IN MISSOURI!<br/>
<br/>
Today my wife Ginny and myself placed two letterboxes at Watkins Mills State Park.  This state park is situated near Kansas City, Missouri, Kearney Missouri actually, a suburb northeast of K.C. and the park approx 4 miles east of Kearney.<br/>
<br/>
The park has a fairly large lake with camping and fishing.  It provides a 3.75 mile asphalt path around the lake with lots of up and down grades, wooden bridges and streams.  They allow rollerblading, bikes, walking and running plus horseback riding.<br/>
<br/>
We will be placing more there this spring.  We also plan to plant some at Buffalo River State Park in northern Arkansas, at Indian Creek and Hemmed in Hollow in April which is the best to float canoes there.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't been following the conversations too much here but plan to do so as to give the clues a home for these new boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Ginny and I are real excited about being involved with this and getting to know you all.<br/>
<br/>
Greg and Ginny <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am absolutely THRILLED!!!  Finally, Missouri has joined the Letterboxing<br/>
scene. Before moving to Portland, Oregon, a couple years ago I lived in Kansas<br/>
City, Missouri, for nearly 10 years.  Being avid campers, my wife and I were<br/>
especially fond of Watkins Mill State Park.<br/>
<br/>
It's a rather small, but beautiful, wooded area near Jesse James' old stomping<br/>
grounds.  You had to make reservations far ahead of time to get a good<br/>
campsite, but it was always well worth it.  The paved track around the lake is<br/>
very nice.  We used to skateboard around it for hours.  (My favorite part was<br/>
the wooden bridges, and the sound it made when we skated over them!)  I<br/>
skinned myself up a few times, but never managed to break any bones (something<br/>
I am prone to doing) or run into anyone.<br/>
<br/>
The largest raccoon I have EVER seen used to show up in our campsite almost<br/>
every night, following his nose as he explored our grill and picnic table<br/>
areas.  One weekend a white-tail fawn kept hanging around our campsite.  On a<br/>
couple of occasions, she walked right into our clearing while we sat and<br/>
watched.  I have pictures of my wife Kelly (holding our camping buddy, Tigger<br/>
the cat) standing in our campsite within 8 to 10 feet of the curious young<br/>
deer.<br/>
<br/>
My fond memories of this beautiful park, combined with the fact that there are<br/>
now letterboxes there, make it imperative that I return in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Greg and Ginny!  I'm looking forward to seeing your clues on the<br/>
map.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
"Der Mad Stamper"<br/>
