&amp; Bruce on the Metacomet Trail within the hanging hills of Meriden, CT. To <br/>
get the clues to the Black Dog of the Hanging Hills go to; <br/>

<br/>
This is a great hike with some steep sections and some very slippery rocks <br/>
when wet. You can cheat on this one if you like (I won't tell you how) but <br/>
you will only cheat yourself out of fabulous views and a couple of great <br/>
stamps. Don't forget the legend too.<br/>
<br/>
Once you stamp in at the first black dog box, continue up to the castle. This <br/>
is a super spot for a picnic. If your lucky and the day is clear, you can see <br/>
all the way to Long Island Sound just past the feet of the sleeping giant.<br/>
<br/>
Once rested follow the blue Metacomet trail just as directed in the black dog <br/>
clues. Directly from the parking lot, go straight into the woods. The trail <br/>
will turn right just before a summit and overlook. Before turning right, <br/>
stand at the highest point straight in front of you. You will see a water <br/>
tower in the distance at a bearing of 230 degrees. At 115 degrees you will <br/>
notice a small 3 foot ledge with some small oak trees growing at its base. <br/>
Also at the base of this ledge is a tree stump. Located at the base of this <br/>
stump well hidden is the Craig's Castle letterbox. Secretly stamp in (there <br/>
may be considerable traffic) and replace where found. <br/>
<br/>
Continue on to the second Black Dog letterbox. <br/>
