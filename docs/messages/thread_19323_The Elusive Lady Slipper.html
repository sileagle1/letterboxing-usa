                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are at least 3 things wrong with this letterbox in Dennis, MA. <br/>
First of all, there are no lady slippers.  Spent most of my time there<br/>
looking for the magnificient Cypripddium Acaule to no avail in<br/>
mid-June - the height of their season.  If anyone spots one of these<br/>
increasingly rare members of the orchid family, please supply me with<br/>
the exact latitude and longitude for verification.  Secondly, any<br/>
Indian Reservation worth visiting would have at least one casino -<br/>
again, there were none to be seen.  Coordinates for any casinos in the<br/>
area would also be appreciated.  Thirdly, we weren't sure if the<br/>
reference to the "second bench" included the ones we already passed<br/>
before the clues referenced the benches.  It wasn't until we passed<br/>
our 11th bench that we realized that we had been going in cirlces<br/>
around the loop.  Hmmm....A dearth of lady slippers and an abundance<br/>
of benches.... - Perhaps the only problem is the name of the<br/>
letterbox...  The placer must have graduated from the "Coon School of<br/>
Navigation" who allegedly learned from Prince Henry the Navigator!<br/>
In any case, we eventually found this letterbox which was the closest<br/>
we ever got to a lady slipper.<br/>

the benches around the loop itself, once you are the place that you are to <br/>

I was there during Memorial Day weekend, and I too didn't see any lady <br/>
slippers (sniff sniff).  (and no casinos either!  which is fine with me since we <br/>
have too many casinos here in CT)<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you found the box though!  Did you find the Ghost Train while you <br/>
were there?  The Headless Hunter's logbooks are great!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmm, was that box named "lady slipper" or what? Could it have been a reference instead to the other kind of lady slipper?  I mean, not the shoe kind, but there is another more domesticated sort.  I have a few clumps of it that a friend gave me a few weeks ago.  It's called Lady slipper and has pinkish blooms like the woodsy one, but shaped much differently.  The blooms start out red and then suddenly they're pink.  Becomes a large, fast-spreading clump.  If you want, I could plant a letterbox here on my property near it and you could find them!  Or, if the woodsy one is really what you're after, check out the Pinnacle LB someday (I've not looked for it yet!) on Hawk Mt. in PA.   In May 2003, there were ladyslippers (Lady Slippers?) right beside the trail heading there.  They were gorgeous specimens and I filled one of my last rolls of Kodachrome 64 w/ them.  Boohoo.  --lunaryakketyact<br/>
