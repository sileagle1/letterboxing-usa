                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was so good to reconnect with old friends and meet new ones so I <br/>
could put a name to a face.  Trish, thanks for putting together the <br/>
local Wickford lettterboxes in time for the event.  I did snag the <br/>
two right outside, and already had the the various letterboxes in the <br/>
area, but I am waiting for another time to do the downtown boxes.  <br/>
Since we go to Wickford just about once a month, I can tell that I <br/>
know just where these other boxes are, and both are near <br/>
establishments we visit frequently.  I wanted to save these for <br/>
another day, when our family does a "wander through Wickford with a <br/>
cup of quad skim latte" ( Yoo Hoo for the children ) and watch people <br/>
while perched on the steps of the Holistic Centre at the "T" at Brown <br/>
and Main Streets.<br/>
<br/>
I wish to thank everyone for being so welcoming and nice to Nutty <br/>
Buddy (the Asian girl who accompanied my daughter, Pretty Kitty, who, <br/>
after a sleepover with a gaggle of girls at my house following a <br/>
middle school dance Friday night, got a crash course on letterboxing <br/>
Saturday morning.  Since for my children, letterboxing events are old <br/>
hat, it was great to see the wonder through the eyes of a teenager's <br/>
first experience.  Now she wants to go letterboxing all the time.  In <br/>
fact, the bug is in her and I'm sure she is going to want to <br/>
letterbox with me and Pretty Kitty all the time now.  In her own <br/>
words - "It sure beats watching TV and playing video games on a nice <br/>
day.  This is really really fun, being outdoors and thinking and <br/>
getting treasures."  One less teenager "unplugged" and outdoors <br/>
getting exercise.  Amen.  I think the word will spread like wildfire <br/>
at the middle school.  Always a good thing.  Since my children never <br/>
had had Game Boys, Nintendo, X-Box, electronics, and computer gaming, <br/>
and never will, they are avid letterboxers (no flames please).  They <br/>
particularly like the Magic Tree house series, having read them all.  <br/>
It brings back a nostagia for when they were "little" (talk about a <br/>
different perspective). <br/>
<br/>
My only regret - not being able to participate in the "story" <br/>
letterbox.  I had to shoot out of there by 3 to make the drive home <br/>
before dusk and it was a 2 hour drive.  My eyes can only take so <br/>
much.  If someone has this as a traveller or personal letterbox, <br/>
please contact me off-line so I can contribute (somehow) to this <br/>
great box.<br/>
<br/>
The food was excellent and I even managed to leave *without* eating <br/>
any "treats" - just salads and who the heck made the green bean, <br/>
tomato, and red onion salad?  I ate a lot of that.  I have made <br/>
a "gathering" recipe file in the "files" section of the official <br/>
site, so please post the recipes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for finding my tofu "plants" mystery gathering box.  I like to <br/>
plant mystery microboxes at indoor events.  Last time there was a <br/>
line for the medicine cabinet at Moose Hill.  This time it was hidden <br/>
amongst the food items in the kitchen.  If anyone didn't get it, I'd <br/>
gladly send the image to you via email on a .jpg file because it will <br/>
be retired after the event.   And the MST event stamp was truly a <br/>
work of art.<br/>
<br/>
Chuck - thanks for bring Molly.  Had I known, I would have brought a <br/>
box of doggie treats.<br/>
<br/>
A special thank you for those of you in the know that greeted me <br/>
with "Hi Warrior Woman, it's XYZ".  Between the various changes of <br/>
clothing throughout the event,  I had a hard time distinguishing <br/>
boxers because of the change in appearance.  You have been so <br/>
tolerant of my visual disability without making me feel like a <br/>
leper.  As I say "Carpe Diem" because I never know what tomorrow will <br/>
bring.  Lady Alafair, thank you for letting me off the bookbinding <br/>
class.  I would slow everyone else down.  And thank you to all <br/>
letterboxers who find my store bought stamps (all from Chica Ink)in <br/>
my boxes.  Detailed work and a sharp instrument do not mix with me <br/>
*at all*.<br/>
<br/>
And thanks to Tom No One, who organized the event.  I wouldn't have <br/>
missed it for the world - barring torrential rain that is.  I'd be <br/>
willing to do the drive, not being daunted by any weather (including <br/>
snow in August) but I'd be violating the terms of my parole ( aka my <br/>
driving restrictions ) if I even attempted such a drive in the rain ( <br/>
and endangering my passengers and motorists in general).  I have a <br/>
very restricted driving license, and I damn well want to keep my <br/>
license.  Losing that would be the death of me.<br/>
<br/>
I neglected to temporary pull Just Bass in the fury of Isabel.  If <br/>
anyone finds this box, please let me know.  I am the "guardian" of <br/>
this box, but I did not have sufficient time to temporary pull this <br/>
box before the sea swells, and I didn't think it was safe to yank it <br/>
today, given all the variables.  The Pt. Judith letterbox (another <br/>
one for which I am a "guardian" was safely tucked in a bit inland, so <br/>
I know that one survived.<br/>
<br/>
And the best part?  Bring home four dirty sandy wet children who <br/>
slept like rocks tonight.  My motto:  At the end of the day, a clean <br/>
kid is a bored kid.  I's rather do a ton of laundry than raise couch <br/>
potatoes.  "Go outside and get dirty" is my approach.<br/>
<br/>
Have I forgotten anything?  This little bout of insomnia tonight has <br/>
my brain all fuzzy.  I may think of more profuse thanks in the <br/>
morning, before leaving for Sunday School and church (I have taught <br/>
Senior High Sunday School for 20+ years now).  No flames please.  I'm <br/>
not a "whomp you upside the head with a Bible person", just your <br/>
ordinary Methodist.  So don't think I'm going to try to "save" you.  <br/>
My deeds speak louder than any words.  At least I think so.<br/>
<br/>
I just know I forgot a thanks here and there, but when clear headed <br/>
and not insomniac (so shoot me - I'm still full of adrenaline and <br/>
endorphines from today), I will express them to the board.<br/>
<br/>
And PsychoKiwis - safe travels to you.<br/>
<br/>
I have to "get up" in two hours, so I will close this post.  Thank <br/>
you for indulging in my long tome.<br/>

As for the salad - it was mine.  I think you and I need to start <br/>
sending recipes back and forth directly.  Your salad was incredible <br/>
also.<br/>

(It requires *multitasking*, y'know, trading stamps and talking at the same time.  I'm so proud that I haven't stamped my own book yet.)  I think I said hello to one of the kids as we passed in the kitchen.  I'm glad that you and your tribe+ made it!  I didn't get a taste of a single salad item but I ate double treats so it all evens out in the end.<br/>
<br/>
I missed the stamp!!  Before I knew it, you were saying good-bye.  Please save it for me.  I hope to see you soon.<br/>

Love to you and your clan,<br/>
