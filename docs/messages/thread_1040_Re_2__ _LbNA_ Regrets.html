<br/>
I was as stunned by Randy's message as you all were and have sent him my<br/>
personal message off list.  I, like us all, am saddened by his wife's<br/>
illness and send her and him all my sincere best wishes and hopes.<br/>
<br/>
Can I please as a "foreigner" still extend my gratitude to Randy for his<br/>
work and fun and for the energy that he has brought to the sites over the<br/>
years...I for one was gladdened by the presence of his messages, crytic<br/>
clues and vitality.<br/>
<br/>
I am just an old UK Dartmoor boxer who has enjoyed the long tale of Boxing<br/>
USA and have been there through the sad "wars" that flowed across my<br/>
screen..I had hoped that good times had come...that a time of calm and<br/>
growth had arrived...but life is not meant to be easy is it <grin><br/>
<br/>
I am certain that LbNA will survive and though I am not in any way part of<br/>
the team who must decide where to go from here...<br/>
...I wish everyone who does the very best of kind thoughts and ...<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget to keep the old Wizard on the new "list"...  <br/>
<br/>
I expect only success !<br/>
<br/>
One day I even plan to have a P and F count of my own in LbNA land...<grin><br/>
<br/>
Here's to your best endeavours.<br/>
