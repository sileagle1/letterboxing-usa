Hi Marjorie!<br/>
<br/>
We have discussed this a few times .  Several people HAVE gotten<br/>
approval to place letterboxes in parks.  I am one.  It is nice to have<br/>
officially sanctioned boxes!  Our feeling is though, that the inherently<br/>
enviro-friendly nature of letterboxing, permission isn't always asked<br/>
for.  It is up to you.  I have boxes out there that are unapproved as<br/>
well. <br/>

my mistake. For a lot of us that means a couple of compass instructions and<br/>
place the box a short distance off the beaten path and use some kind of<br/>
natural cover. A chunk of bark, pile of sticks, pile of bricks or a couple<br/>
of flat stones. All these types of concealments will help keep the box being<br/>
found by non-letterbox, but stand out enough to be found by a letterboxer<br/>
with the clues..<br/>

new sites for additional boxes.  Do you think that putting several<br/>
easy boxes in a very small area would be so unchallenging that you'd<br/>

checked by me in a couple of years and so I'm hoping it's still there<br/>
(I plan on checking it sometime in the next couple of months), but I<br/>
checked the Noone Falls box yesterday and it's still in close to<br/>
pristine condition.  I'm surprised that it hasn't gotten lost or<br/>
tampered with.  It just needs more stamps in it!  I want to plant more<br/>
boxes in areas that are easily accessible.<br/>

    I think several boxes in one area would be a great thing for novice<br/>
boxers in that the rewards would get them well started on a collections<br/>
of stamps.  It may be that the experience would help them develop a<br/>
passion (quick rewards).  The Sherburne Pass area near Killington,<br/>
Vermont has 4 boxes within a mile or so and this seems to have worked<br/>
quite well.  I still have to go back and collect 1/2 of a pair that<br/>
makes a single image.  Perhaps the clue writing could take one hither<br/>
and yon before ending in a location near another box?  This<br/>
mischievousness would be enchanting to me.  Of course, one would need to<br/>
be cautious in placing boxes, or writing clues, in a manner that would<br/>
lead someone to mistakenly discover the "wrong" container.<br/>
<br/>
    We drove by Noone Falls last year near dark with no time to stop but<br/>
I vowed to return, it is an intriguing location and (pay attention<br/>
folks) the bakery cafe look pretty darn interesting as well.  Good luck!<br/>
