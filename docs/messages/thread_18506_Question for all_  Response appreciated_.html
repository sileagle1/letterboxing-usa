Here is a question for everyone.  If a book were to be written on letterboxing, would you want your stamps to be featured in it?  Would you want to contribute something written about yourself (how you got into the hobby and what it means to you)?  Why or why not?<br/>
<br/>
Please respond to me personally at the email provided.  After a couple days, I will compile the responses and send to the list.  This is to reduce clutter.  Also, if you don't want your response in the compiled email, let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Send here:<br/>

Thanks!   <br/>
