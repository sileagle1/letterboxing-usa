<br/>
Ryan, I have to strongly disagree with this statement. Your poll, and <br/>
the related conclusion, is quite fuzzy.<br/>
<br/>
The poll question:<br/>
<br/>
&gt;"Letterboxing and geocaching share some similarities and some people<br/>
combine the two into one box. If I HAD to choose one of these <br/>
answers, based on my experience<br/>
&gt;I would:<br/>
&gt; always combine the two if I can<br/>
&gt; never combine the two I can<br/>
&gt; only combine them in well-traveled places<br/>
&gt; only combine them in seldom-traveled places<br/>
&gt; only combine them in very remote places"<br/>
<br/>
    The only person who can make a choice of "combining" the hobbies <br/>
into one box is the person who places a box at a location and chooses <br/>
to write clues in a letterboxing format, a geocaching format, or <br/>
both. The rest of us can choose to go or not go to search for the <br/>
box, based on whether it's one, the other, both, or a myriad of other <br/>
factors. I believe your question doesn't solicit our views of what we <br/>
prefer to look for. It only asks about the boxes that we choose to <br/>
place. That's a significant difference, and it makes your conclusion, <br/>
that letterboxers dislike searching for hybrids simply because they <br/>
are hybrids, unreachable, at least based on this online poll.<br/>
<br/>
    I participate in both forms of this hobby and have no problem <br/>
looking for hybrids. But I don't expect to create one, based on the <br/>
type of letterbox clues that I plan to write (several mysteries <br/>
scouted and written, waiting for the trip to actually place them), <br/>
and the places where I plan to hide caches (off-trail, places where <br/>
I'm not creative enough to write a text description without the map <br/>
as a reference, so just mark the map with either a circle or the <br/>
lat/long).<br/>
<br/>
    Since lat/long will spoil any mystery clue, a hybrid's clue is <br/>
going to be straight forward. If your definition of a quality <br/>
letterbox requires something other than a straight forward clue, <br/>
hybrids are going to disappoint you. So will the majority of <br/>
letterboxes, since most clues are straight forward, regardless of <br/>
whether they are supplemented by lat/long. My definition of a quality <br/>
box is that it's where it's supposed to be, it and its contents are <br/>
in good repair, it's in a location where it won't be confiscated for <br/>
lack of landowner permission, and it's labeled and organized in a <br/>
manner that discourages vandalism and theft. There are quality caches,<br/>
letterboxes, and hybrids of all difficulties that meet this <br/>
definition. For a hybrid, part of a good box organization means that <br/>
the stamp is labeled clearly (perhaps a smaller box in a box) to <br/>
avoid it being traded out, and there is an explanation in the clues <br/>
and in the box, that the box is both a geocache and a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
    I certainly appreciate the time and efforts that everyone puts <br/>
into placing boxes and caches. Some are better than others, but <br/>
that's a function of planning and materials for both types of <br/>
objects. Plant what you want. For me, there are plenty of factors <br/>
that will determine if I come looking for it, but specifically being <br/>
a letterbox or a hybrid will not be one of the factors.<br/>
<br/>
    Happy hunting.<br/>

<br/>
Granted, it's not the best poll one could make for the hybrid <br/>
question, but it's NOT my poll.  I just happened to find it while <br/>
wandering around the links on the left side of the screen.  I have no <br/>
idea who made it or when it was created.<br/>
<br/>
And I already said it's not scientifically accurate--but it seems <br/>
reasonable to think that most people who prefer not to hide hybrid <br/>
boxes also aren't inclined to find them.  If someone wants to find a <br/>
geocache, they don't come to the letterboxing board in order to find <br/>
them!<br/>
<br/>
But if you still don't believe me, at the next letterboxing gathering <br/>
you go to, ask around if people would prefer to find hybrid or stand-<br/>
alone letterboxes.  The overwhelming amount of letterboxes prefer <br/>
stand-alone.<br/>
<br/>
Which is NOT to say they will not look for hybrids, but that they'd <br/>
prefer not to.  And I kind of feel--as someone who does hide <br/>
letterboxes--that it's kind of my 'duty' to hide the best boxes <br/>
possible so people can enjoy them as much as possible.  Going against <br/>
the grain like that will upset some people, but going with the grain <br/>
upsets nobody.  A great letterbox is something people like--which <br/>
automatically gives a hybrid a handicap.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If your definition of a quality letterbox requires something other<br/>
&gt; than a straight forward clue, hybrids are going to disappoint you.<br/>
&gt; So will the majority of letterboxes, since most clues are straight<br/>
&gt; forward, regardless of whether they are supplemented by lat/long.<br/>
<br/>
If you've read my webpage about creating great letterboxes, the clue <br/>
is only one aspect to a quality letterbox.  And in some cases, a <br/>
straight-forward clue is the BEST clue for some letterboxes.  It <br/>
depends on your audience, where the box is hidden, and any number of <br/>
factors.<br/>
<br/>
As a whole, I tend to enjoy boxes more when they don't have straight-<br/>
forward clues, but that's certainly not my only criteria!<br/>
<br/>
In any case, defending hybrids is a silly exercise since it's easy <br/>
enough to separate them and hide them near each other.  Everybody's <br/>
happy, it requires virtually no extra effort, and what's the problem?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; For a hybrid, part of a good box organization means that <br/>
&gt; the stamp is labeled clearly (perhaps a smaller box in a box) to <br/>
&gt; avoid it being traded out<br/>
<br/>
Okay, if you've ALREADY got a smaller box in the geocache for the <br/>
letterbox, is it really that much effort to hide it behind the next <br/>
tree and call them two totally different boxes?  Why are you so fixed <br/>
on hybrids?  Perhaps they don't bother you, but they DO bother other <br/>
people.  I've NEVER heard of anyone complaining that a letterbox <br/>
wasn't a hybrid, so why not hide them separately and make EVERYBODY <br/>
happy?<br/>
<br/>
Whenever you hide a letterbox or geocache, you have to keep in mind <br/>
that it's not just for your personal gratification, but other people <br/>
will be looking for your boxes and you (I would hope!) want to give <br/>
them the best possible experience you can.  I know I do!<br/>

To me this includes the message boards, where you are ruining good <br/>
reading by foisting your opinions as the best way, the right way, the <br/>
most logical way.  If you don't like hybrids don't look for them, but <br/>
quit trying to convince others to stop placing them.  Let it rest.  <br/>

There are no letterboxes in my area at all.  I have considered placing<br/>
hybrids to interest the other geocachers in letterboxing.  I've talked<br/>
online with a couple of them, and they say, tell me more about letterboxing!<br/>
Maybe we can get some people crossed over, so that they'll start planting<br/>
letterboxes.  There's a gazillion geocaches around here.<br/>
<br/>
So, to answer the poll, I would place Hybrids in remote areas that were<br/>
devoid of letterboxes in a selfish attempt to get more people to cross over<br/>
and do both.<br/>
