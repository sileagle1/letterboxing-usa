and they were kind enough to reply in detail! We thought it might<br/>
be helpful for others as well, to see their answers compiled into<br/>
one post, so...<br/>
Following are some of the questions I asked and their answers,<br/>
which they have so graciously given me permission to share!<br/>

What is a charity walk?<br/>
<br/>
And for me, the real question was what _isn't_ a charity walk!<br/>
I was getting confused thinking that the "walk" part was like<br/>
Walk/Runs for Charity in the US, where lots of people start<br/>
at the same place and time and end up at a finish line somewhere.<br/>
So, thanks to Rob and Graham, I now know that a letterboxing<br/>
charity walk is an event in which clues for a specific number of<br/>
letterboxes which are hidden for a certain amount of time along<br/>
a  specific route, and the people who purchase the clues go<br/>
a-hunting at their own time and pace.<br/>
