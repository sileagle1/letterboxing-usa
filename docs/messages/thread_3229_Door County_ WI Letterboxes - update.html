<br/>
This is my first attempt at letterboxing and I was fortunate enough <br/>
to start in beautiful Door County, WI.<br/>
<br/>
We attempted the following letterboxes:<br/>
<br/>
Old Bailey's Harbor Lighthouse - we didn't find it.  Has anyone found <br/>
this recently?  My husband and I combed the area pretty well and <br/>
didn't know if we couldn't find it because we were new or because the <br/>
clues were too general?  Any ideas anyone?<br/>
<br/>
Bailey's Harbor Range Lights - after the disappointment at the old <br/>
lighthouse, we decided to try this one because the clues are <br/>
straightforward.  We thought it was even better that some of the <br/>
vegetation looked like people had been looking for this letterbox <br/>
recently.  Well, we looked all along that bridge and there was <br/>
NOTHING.  I think this is definitely missing :(.  Perhaps looking for <br/>
the letterbox was causing too much damage to the plant life and the <br/>
part stewards took the box?<br/>
<br/>
Cana Island - We loved the clues and the fact that we finally got to <br/>
use our new compass.  After a slight miscalculation, we backtracked <br/>
and found our first letterbox!!!  Hurray!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Day Two:<br/>
<br/>
Sturgeon Bay Shipping Canal - the site was BEAUTIFUL!  I wouldn't <br/>
have found this place if it wasn't for letterboxing.  However, NO <br/>
LETTERBOX :(.  I poked around every hole and rock I could think of, <br/>
but again, nothing.  Has anyone found this recently?  Too bad, there <br/>
was a bonus stamp with clues inside this box.<br/>
<br/>
Chanticleer Guest House - we weren't sure if we were trespassing, but <br/>
there was a letterbox out there!  So, we cut through a gorgeous <br/>
meadow and into the woods.  My husband found it pretty quickly!  <br/>
Sadly, this box is soaking wet.  The logbook is mushy and so is the <br/>
stamp.  We tried to wring it out as best as we could and sealed it up <br/>
tight.  The people that stamped in before us commented on how wet <br/>
this box was too.<br/>
<br/>
Cave Point Letterbox - the "difficult and dangerous" rating worried <br/>
me a bit, and so did the part about "cliffs", but I wanted another <br/>
stamp.  So, off we went.  The views were magnificent!!!  And, like <br/>
the other box that this person hid, the clues were wonderful.  We <br/>
found our third letterbox and had a blast hiking this trail.<br/>
<br/>
If you know anything about these letterboxes, please reply to this <br/>
ppost.  I'd love to know if we just missed all three letterboxes or <br/>
if they are somehow missing too.<br/>
<br/>
So, those were the experiences of a brand new letterboxer (actually <br/>
there are two of us).  We hope that there will be more in the Midwest!<br/>
<br/>
Happy letterboxing,<br/>

I am a beginner as well with only 12 boxes found. Many of them were from the<br/>
Door County area, which my wife and I along with a fellow letterboxer spent<br/>
a most wonderful weekend at the end of July.<br/>
<br/>
We too could not find either of the Bailey's harbor boxes, searching long<br/>
and hard along the wooden bridge and at the beach during a pouring rain. The<br/>
water level was very low and we suspected the clues to follow the shoreline<br/>
towards the lighthouse were vague considering the shoreline was probably<br/>
completely different when the box was planted. My friend felt that possible<br/>
the clue meant to follow the shoreline and cross the shallow bay to the<br/>
lighthouse where we might find it, but this was an after thought.<br/>
<br/>
The two boxes at "The Sturgeon Bay Light House and Shipping Canal" were both<br/>
there, however the "bonus" stamp appeared missing.<br/>
<br/>
Finding the Chanticleer Guest House box was kinda weird. We looked around<br/>
for someone to ask permission to search but not finding anyone we just went<br/>
ahead and found it. No one had been there since 1999 and yes we found it<br/>
completely soaked.<br/>
<br/>
Cave point was great.<br/>
<br/>
You didn't mention the "Sister Bay/Mink River" box. Finding that was the<br/>
most fun of all.<br/>
<br/>
My friend planted a new Door County box at Peninsula State Park, but to my<br/>
knowledge hasn't published the clues yet. I've submitted clues to one at<br/>
Holy Hill in Hubertus WI.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that the box at Heritage Hill State Park, in Green Bay is no<br/>
longer there. We searched long and hard, but the wood pile doesn't exist any<br/>
longer. (washed away?)<br/>
<br/>
Last week I was in Green Bay and looked for the few at the University there.<br/>
Found two, both wet. The Cofrin Aboretum #1 could not be found, but I am not<br/>
prepared to claim it is missing.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck. Maybe we'll run into each other someday.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all, especially those who hunted boxes in Door<br/>
Co. recently,<br/>
<br/>
I placed most of the boxes in question, and recently<br/>
tried to check on them.  Here's what I found:<br/>
<br/>
Old Bailey's Harbor - It was there, but waterlogged,<br/>
so I removed it to replace in a better container and<br/>
location in the near future.  Only one other person<br/>
had found it, but the shoreline clue was still valid. <br/>
Given the changing water level over the last few<br/>
years, I will be changing the clue when the box is<br/>
replaced just to be on the safe side.  This "box" was<br/>
a plastic jar from a scientific supply complany that<br/>
Dan'l had sent me before he dropped off the list many<br/>
eons ago.  I guess they're not as airtight as I'd<br/>
hoped they would be.<br/>
<br/>
Bailey's Harbor Range Lights - I couldn't find this<br/>
one, but I suspect it would have been in the same<br/>
condition as the other, as it was a similar container.<br/>
 It probably washed away some time ago.<br/>
<br/>
Mink River - It's there, intact, but a little soggy. <br/>
I'll replace the log book next time I go there.<br/>
<br/>
Sturgeon Bay Canal Light - I didn't check this one,<br/>
but it was reported as there earlier this summer,<br/>
though the bonus stamp was gone.<br/>
<br/>
Chanticleer Guest House - The owners have given<br/>
permission to walk the trail and look for the<br/>
letterbox.  They know it's there, but I don't think<br/>
they've found it themselves.  Dierdra placed this box,<br/>
and they're friends of hers.  They also sell sweaters<br/>
Dierdra has made from the wool they get off their<br/>
sheep.  Stop by, see the sheep, find the box, it's a<br/>
good time.<br/>
<br/>
Sherwood Point - Gone gone gone, long gone.  Dierdra's<br/>
box at the end of the road?  I don't think even she<br/>
could find it again.<br/>
<br/>
Algoma Lighthouse - I couldn't find it, so it might be<br/>
gone.  It's a big pile of rocks after all.<br/>
<br/>
LaSalle Park - also gone.<br/>
<br/>
UWGB - Some gone, some not.  #1 is actually there at<br/>
last report, but not where the original clue states. <br/>
I need to move it back.<br/>
<br/>
Heritage Hill - Another of Dierdra's.  I haven't found<br/>
this one yet, but I haven't had occasion to look for<br/>
it either.<br/>
<br/>
I'm quite pleased that a good many have survived this<br/>
long, especially Cave Point, Mink River, and Cana<br/>
Island.  Those were the most fun for me to plant so<br/>
far.  Now that there are other letterboxers in the<br/>
area, I'll really have to get back to repairing,<br/>
replacing, and planting letterboxes.  I hope to see<br/>
some out there for me to hunt too!<br/>
