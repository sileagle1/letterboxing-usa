sympathetic....excuse my typing as I am seeing double right now!!<br/>
<br/>
On Memorial Day, I went out boxing as I have been for the last few <br/>
weeks...I had my sister (new to this craziness) and another friend <br/>
with me.  They were both smart and wore pants.  Me? Not so <br/>
smart....wore shorts because "I've never gotten poison ivy before".  <br/>
My advice to you all?  Never say never!  I woke up Wednesday morning <br/>
at about 4:30 am, scratching myself silly.  Upon inspection, I had <br/>
four small spots of redness on my right leg from knee down.  I did <br/>
the repsonsible thing, bought some over the counter stuff (Ivy <br/>
Dry...does work well), and tried to not scratch.  Well, I spent <br/>
yesterday in the ER with a swollen, red, raised, hot leg to find out <br/>
the my "little" bit of poison ivy has developed into a cellulitis.  <br/>
Apparently, I have just been lucky up to now and can expect this <br/>
type of reaction any time that I get it.  I can't stand on that leg <br/>
for very long and it is VERY uncomfortable and unattractive.  I am <br/>
also supposed to wear shorts or skirts and let the world see it, <br/>
too!  (By the way, if you see me, feel free to point and laugh as I <br/>
fully deserve it!! *LOL*)  The absolute best part is that I will <br/>
have this loveliness for FOURTEEN days!!  Yee-haw....just in time <br/>
for my vacation...no boxing for me for a while, either!!<br/>
<br/>
OK...so there it is...kind of pathetic but I had to share....<br/>

Happy Trails, Kerri<br/>

Oh that is so awful. I hadn't either until the past couple of years. It is cumulative, so <br/>
the more you are exposed to it - essentially the less tolerance you have.  It is <br/>
counter-intuitive. My best word of advice to all kids and parents out there based on <br/>
my experience as an environmental educator - please wear thin, long pants. Tuck <br/>
your socks into your pants and look like a dork. Not only are you protecting your legs <br/>
from sunburn, poison ivy, but also ticks in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
If you wear long pants that are light colored, the ticks will also show up easier when <br/>
you get home.  Throw all your clothing in the wash, sneakers, socks and pants <br/>
because if you've tromped through the stuff the oils and poison ivy residue will <br/>
remain on your clothing until next summer. <br/>
<br/>
Make some iced-tea for yourself and take care.<br/>

Can't say that I'm sympathetic but I can sympathize.  Went letterboxing on May 12 - completed the XYZ series in Deep River (left the Rocket Ride hitchhiker).  Poison ivy showed up on my inner thighs and the back of my right hand Thursday.  Spent the following week in skirts (we have a length limit on shorts at work that none of mine conform to and I am NOT a skirt person - the (45) guys in my department really enjoyed it).  Took about a week for the poison ivy to dry up and THEN the itching started - scratched my way to a nasty case of cellulitis as well - steroids, antibiotics, antihistimines - the works.  I know what it looks like and am very good about washing up (don't forget to wash your clothes/shoes separately) if I may have been out around it but I am just one of those luck few who can look at it and break out - am convinced that it actually comes out of the woods to find me.<br/>

Grin &amp; bear it - there's not much more you can do!<br/>

TecNu<br/>
The "oil" that gets on your skin from PI is actually a resin, not an <br/>
oil, and it makes a molecular bond with the skin. That's why it's so <br/>
hard to get it off. This stuff does the trick, way down on the <br/>
molecular level. It also gets your clothes decontaminated, although <br/>
the package is really vague as to how much to use. If you suspect <br/>
contact and use TecNu right away, it can actually prevent the rash. <br/>
If you use it as soon as the rash shows, it keeps it from getting <br/>
worse. Foresters buy it by the case.<br/>
This is the companion product to IvyBlock, which works by bonding to <br/>
your skin at that same molecular level, so there's no place left for <br/>
the PI resin to stick.<br/>
