tracking down boxes at a local nature center/park. They had closed down a<br/>
section of trail (yes, right where the box is hidden but no worries) because<br/>
a pair of red-tailed hawks had built a nest in the meadow and were dive<br/>
bombing visitors.<br/>
<br/>
Why is seeing a pair of fairly common hawks a reward? Because this nature<br/>
center/park is in the middle of Long Beach, an area just as urban as it's<br/>
nearest major city neighbor, Los Angeles. Had we not been there searching<br/>
for the box, we'd never have seen the happy couple and been able to watch<br/>
them hunt some manner of small rodent for nearly 15 minutes. We couldn't get<br/>
to the box, but in the end, we didn't care. We got our reward, with or<br/>
without a stamp in our book :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There it is.  I would be disappointed if I did not find a box under <br/>
normal circumstance because it would mean my navigation etc had <br/>
failed.<br/>
<br/>
If I got to a spot and the box was missing, like what happened to me <br/>
at Ft Worden, then I am disappointed for myself and the placer, <br/>
though having enjoyed a nice hike in an interesting area is reward <br/>
enough.<br/>
<br/>
If I had been turned back because of a pair of nesting whatevers, I <br/>
would be thrilled!<br/>
<br/>
For an urban area (like a mall or downtown) I would want the clues to <br/>
be tricky and make me "work" for it.  However, if the stamp is <br/>
missing, I would be more disappointed than if I had missed a stamp <br/>
after a great outdoor hike.  I am a country girl at heart and as a <br/>
rule prefer not to go to malls etc "for fun".  I hate shopping.<br/>
<br/>
Most of our urban boxes here are in great parks, the best being Pt <br/>
Defiance in Tacoma WA.  We are blessed with great parks, greenbelts <br/>
and overlooks.<br/>
