Wow, I had no idea my Pokemon stamps would be in such hot demand, but <br/>
since I already offered them to "BeMa (NaDaHa)" first, they'll get <br/>
first dibs on it.  Maybe I can make some more up for you, though.  =)<br/>

Hi Ryan,  Thanks,  We weren't asking for the stamps .... we were just suggesting a Pokemon theme for them.  <br/>

Oh, heck, I don't know. *shrug*  I don't even know the names of the <br/>
Pokemon characters!  All Pokemon questions should be directed to <br/>
somebody else more knowledgeable in such subjects.  Contrary to <br/>
popular belief, I really don't know everything.  I just act like <br/>
it.  ;o)<br/>
