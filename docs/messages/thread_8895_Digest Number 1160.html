INDIANA STATE PARK SERIES<br/>
<br/>
MYSTERY LETTERBOX # 1<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Placed: 11-2-02<br/>
<br/>
Clues: Easy<br/>
<br/>
Terrain: Easy<br/>
<br/>
Hider: Hoosier Honey Bee<br/>
<br/>
STATE PARK CLUES:<br/>
<br/>
This park is located just beyond the southernmost extension of the glaciers<br/>
that once covered the state. Formed at the bottom of a shallow sea 250<br/>
million years ago, regional uplifts and gradual erosion gave rise to the<br/>
winding ridges and deep ravines characteristic of this land now covered by<br/>
hardwood forest.<br/>
<br/>
Encompassing 15,696 acres, this is the largest State Park in Indiana. It was<br/>
established in 1929.  The Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the roads,<br/>
buildings, two log lookout towers and two lakes. There is a saddle barn, 70<br/>
miles of bridle trails, and a horseman's camp. For the hiker, there are over<br/>
12 miles of trails. This park has a nature center with a snake exhibit and<br/>
bird watching room. The wildlife that inhabits this park are adapted to life<br/>
in the forest and forest edges.white-tailed deer, raccoon, gray squirrel and<br/>
birds such as white-breasted nuthatch, cardinal, junco, pileated woodpecker,<br/>
and wild turkey. At the north entrance to the park is the Ramp Bridge over<br/>
Salt Creek. Built in 1838 and moved to the park in 1932, it is the only<br/>
two-lane covered bridge constructed with Burr arch trusses in Indiana.<br/>
<br/>
LETTERBOX CLUES:<br/>
<br/>
Start your search at Trailhead # 6 that circles the smaller of the two<br/>
lakes. Ascend the stairs off to the right of the earthen dam. Much of this<br/>
path is composed of wooden boardwalks and several staircases that lead down<br/>
to the water. You will come to a section of boardwalk that is built around<br/>
two trees. Keep on walking. You will cross a wooden bridge and climb another<br/>
set of stairs further along the path. Up ahead you will come to a stone<br/>
bridge. From the middle of it walk about 40 paces (1 pace is about 3 feet).<br/>
You should be at a large flat boulder that lies directly on the trail. Step<br/>
over the boulder and walk another 10 paces. There is an oak tree on your<br/>
right with a large flat slab of sandstone that juts horizontally out of the<br/>
ground at its base. The letterbox lies in a protected hollow underneath the<br/>
slab hidden by some small stones.  This is a busy trail; please be discreet<br/>
when stamping up and re-hiding this letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Before you set out, read the waiver of responsibility and disclaimer.<br/>

<br/>
2 bits of news from Ennisbrook today.<br/>
First, my neighbor loaned me his ferret to rescue Don &amp; Gwen's Whoo<br/>
letterbox.  The box is now back in it's proper spot, safe &amp; sound.<br/>
Second, Ennisbrook now has a bonus box, courtesy of the maestro<br/>
himself, Legerdemaine.  A gem of a stamp.  The clues to this one are<br/>
available from one of the other Critters in the Ennisbrook series.<br/>
Thanks to "Eat" &amp; "Chickadee" for their assistance &amp; good company<br/>
today.<br/>

Yep, The C &amp; O Canal.<br/>
<br/>
Hee hee, nice try.  It's a National HISTORIC Park.  If you are in the<br/>
DC area, then an actual NP near you would be Shenandoah.  Go there, &amp;<br/>
if you are successful in securing permission, you shall have your<br/>
donuts.<br/>
I'd love to have someone prove me wrong, but I'm not holding my<br/>
breath.  Funhog's encounter with a ranger is typical of the<br/>
prevailing mindset.  (By the way, Funhog, donuts do fly - you of all<br/>
people should know that!).<br/>

First off, THANK YOU dvn2rckr for driving the brain on this.  You did a<br/>
great job!!!<br/>
<br/>
Ryan, it's true most Seattle girls don't have fangs <g> and it was nice to<br/>
know you don't have little pointy horns <g>.  However, your halo did seem a<br/>
bit tarnished after the Math Letterbox incident.  ;-)  (Just teasing!!)<br/>
Your Event Stamp / Letterbox Clue was truly inspired.  I had a great time<br/>
following an *actual* Treasure Map to the hidden Booty!!  =D<br/>
<br/>
Hoopoe, to my great pleasure, agreed to be my hiking buddy.  I really<br/>
enjoyed chatting with her.  She's simply a font of outdoor knowledge... and<br/>
even laughed at my corny jokes.  Besides, how can I not like someone who<br/>
enjoys a good shuffle thru the leaves too!<br/>
<br/>
Quentos and Jodobird (&amp; Constanza) joined us by the lake.  We had great fun<br/>
getting to know each other and scratching our heads looking for the hidden<br/>
treasure.  I was particularly taken with Constanza and kept threatening to<br/>
slip her in my pocket and take her home with me.<br/>
<br/>
Amanda and Amanda, it was great to meet you both.  I've enjoyed getting to<br/>
know each of you via Email.  It's nice to have faces for the names!<br/>
<br/>
Eliza, it was great to see you one last time before you begin your Grand<br/>
Trek south.  I'll be counting the days till your return to Seattle.<br/>
<br/>
All the kids were great.  I especially enjoyed watching them play in the<br/>
leaves.<br/>
<br/>
I still haven't stopped to count my stamps yet.  I didn't get all the stamps<br/>
that were hidden at the park, but I've already told my Mother that we have<br/>
to take a trip down there together.  She'd love it.<br/>
<br/>
Whew, well time for bed... what a weekend!<br/>
