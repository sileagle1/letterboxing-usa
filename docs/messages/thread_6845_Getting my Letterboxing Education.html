  1-ESAK- Ihave no idea<br/>
  2-P- planted<br/>
  3-F-found<br/>
  4-X- exchanged- meet another letterboxer and excange stamps<br/>
  5-V- virtual- there is a section in this site reg. vituals.  They <br/>
are challenging.  We do them when it's too hot to go out.<br/>
  6-C- confiscated as reported in post # 14389<br/>
  7-L- that's my nephews own personal addition because he likes <br/>
lizards and the word googol.  I on the other hand have now <br/>
encountered 3.  2 real and 1 stamped courtesy of twogreysquirrels. L <br/>
is just to add a little fun and humor to a sport (that is as I was <br/>
told to be fun).  You don't need to add it to your list.  IT was all <br/>
meant to be fun...<br/>

An ESAK is an Elmer, Sarah, Allison &amp; Kyle. They're a family of <br/>
'boxers from central CT, frequently met at area gatherings.<br/>
<br/>
What I wonder, if L is for lizard, could other herpetiles be included <br/>
in that? In CT we haven't much for lizards, but we do have snakes, <br/>
salimanders, and frogs -- and we've seen and photographed lots (maybe <br/>
not quite a google...how about an arugula?)<br/>
