                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow we are getting this organized! We  have 15 replies today counting <br/>
my son and I and my club kids will double that easily.  We will play <br/>
Host as thats how we get the fascility free!  So far we have an offer <br/>
of soup, several for bread I will do dairy products from our <br/>
farm.Some papergoods. Who else and what can you bring.<br/>
  With new thoughts :I think we will make a a.m. sign in at the <br/>
fairgrounds and that will be available all day. With a few activities <br/>
there. So people can come when they can.  Then off to box, stop by <br/>
Storrs and the Rubber Stamp Shop, back to the fairgrounds for dinner <br/>
and fun. People will be able to drop supplies that are perishable on <br/>
the registration  visit. There will be a couple  boxes available for <br/>
the kids while parents get organized. <br/>
How about a homecarved stamp competition everybody bring one they <br/>
make and we will have a fun "Judging" categories as funniest, most <br/>
artistic etc.  We should wrap up the day by 8 or 8:30 as we have <br/>
school the next day! ponder all of that and reply.    Carol <br/>
