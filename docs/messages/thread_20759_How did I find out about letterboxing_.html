letterboxing.  I was so excited about it, but couldn't find any other <br/>
letterboxers in my area.   I loved carving stamps and letterboxing sounded <br/>
like just "the ticket!"   I filed it away in the recesses of my mind for <br/>
future reference.<br/>
<br/>
Recently I started thinking about letterboxing again and did a search on the <br/>
internet.  I was very excited to see that we now have a number of <br/>
letterboxes placed in my state!!  I love the added connection with other <br/>
lbers via the internet.<br/>
<br/>
...and now you know "the rest of the story."<br/>

&gt;Subject: newbie introduction, and a question<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi!<br/>
&gt;I am a letterboxer in Georgia who is new to the pastime- I have found 5 <br/>
&gt;letterboxes<br/>
&gt;so far. This is so much fun! My husband and I have both carved stamps, and <br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt;usually hike with our baby (turning one year old this month!). I look <br/>
&gt;forward to finding<br/>
&gt;(and placing) many letterboxes in the future.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am curious: how did you find out about letterboxing? In my case, I was <br/>
&gt;browsing at<br/>
&gt;REI (an outdoor sports store) and found a book on letterboxing. The more I <br/>
&gt;read, the<br/>
&gt;more excited I got! Could this be true? Were there really little boxes with <br/>
&gt;hand carved<br/>
&gt;stamps hidden in secret spots outdoors all over North America (and <br/>
&gt;elsewhere, of<br/>
&gt;course!)?? Too cool! I was immediately hooked. It's a perfect hobby for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What about you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Happy hunting,<br/>
