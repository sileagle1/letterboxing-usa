<br/>
I think most of us have tried this way:<br/>
<br/>
     Tell your friends about it.<br/>
     Try to stir up interest locally.<br/>
<br/>
I still think this is essential and I prefer it to web advertising.<br/>
When I meet<br/>
someone who I think may be interested I tell them to go to the web page<br/>
to<br/>
find out more about it (I've done this with about a dozen people over<br/>
the<br/>
last 9 months).<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any other ideas?  What about having a brochure to<br/>
hand out?  I'm thinking something colorful, simple, perhaps using<br/>
animated<br/>
graphics- something that folds open to a map that looks like a treasure<br/>
hunt<br/>
or something along that line.  It could have links and information about<br/>
who<br/>
to contact or where to go to get supplies.<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone in our group involved in promotion, advertising or publishing?<br/>

&gt; What ideas does anyone have about generating interest in the hobby?<br/>

<br/>
I dunno... after the recent rash of vandalism, I am reluctant to promote<br/>
letterboxing to ANYONE who doesn't show enough interest to seek out the<br/>
group.  I realize that the target audience is rather small (people<br/>
interested in l-boxing with internet access), but we are dedicated.  I<br/>
think we should continue to pass it along by word of mouth to people we<br/>
know and trust.  The ones who find us on the www are just lucky &amp; should<br/>
automatically be included.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is anyone in our group involved in promotion, advertising or publishing?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
yes, yes and yes.  I think the nice printed sheet a la Mitch is great. <br/>
I hand those out whenever I get a chance.  It has all of the pertinent<br/>
information and references.  Anyone who REALLY wants to get involved in<br/>
l-boxing can take it from there.  Anything more (IMO) would seem<br/>
schmaltzy.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think word of mouth is the preferred means of publicity.  This method<br/>
provides the best control over who receives the information, and comes closest<br/>
to adhering to the original spirit of British letterboxing.  <br/>
<br/>
Another method of getting word out that I am in favor of is to allow short<br/>
news bits to be included in publications and internet newsgroups with narrow,<br/>
specialized followings that are directly related to our activities.  For<br/>
example, the few blurbs we have gotten in magazines dedicated to orienteering<br/>
and rubber stamp art were very appropriate, in my opinion.  They were short,<br/>
factual, and not sensationalized or over-glorified.  <br/>
<br/>
I think distributing such 'tips' to groups that are involved in orienteering,<br/>
stamp art, hiking, carving, bird watching, scouting, etc. through specialized<br/>
magazines and newsgroups will get word out to those people who have the<br/>
aptitude and respect we desire without exposing our activities to the general<br/>
public.  In most cases, all that is needed is a sentence or two describing the<br/>
hobby and the URL address to our website.  <br/>
<br/>
I am afraid that if we make flyers that look too professional and 'glitzy' we<br/>
will give the impression of a wealthy establishment, rather than the low-key<br/>
grass roots group of volunteers we really are.  If we look like we've poured a<br/>
lot of cash into promotion, people blindly assume that we are trying to profit<br/>
from the activity somehow.  Then they lose sight of our civic-minded<br/>
intentions and will be less likely to respect our hobby and our letterboxes. <br/>
<br/>
If we make flyers we need to keep them very down-to-earth.  They should have a<br/>
hand-made feel about them.  I'm not saying it shouldn't be an electronic<br/>
document that can be downloaded or printed on a laser printer.  I'm just<br/>
recommending that we keep it basic.  I like Dan's idea of using stamp art for<br/>
graphics.  I also like the warm sentimental approach that Deborah describes...<br/>
interesting stories, etc.  Something with personality.  And, yes, these flyers<br/>
would be intended only as a supplement to word-of-mouth promotion -- not as a<br/>
press release to the general public.<br/>

<br/>
FWIW, I like the idea of word-of-mouth.  I fear that publicising (sp?) to<br/>
too great a degree might lead to more vandalism.  I've pointed a few people<br/>
to the LB-USA website and have given the "About Letterboxing" sheet that I<br/>
put in my boxes to a few friends who are interested in hiking, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I think the best type of publicity is word-of-mouth.  Don't<br/>
worry...they'll tell two friends...and they'll tell two friends...and so<br/>
on...and so on...<br/>
<br/>
Also FWIW, I plan to adopt the more cryptic "Dartmoor-style" clues for<br/>
future boxes that I place.  Looking at my existing clues in comparison to<br/>
the traditional clues across the pond in Dartmoor have lead me to believe<br/>
that it would be better to be a little more cryptic.  Not that I don't like<br/>
nice maps and directions!  heh heh heh<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am all with Graham for making our clues challenging. As Thom said, <br/>
maybe a few relatively easy ones, for kids or whomever, but <br/>
identified as easy. Some searchers, the majority I would guess, are <br/>
going to want the challenge of cryptic clues. I would rather miss <br/>
some boxes (even after a long drive) and be challenged, than always <br/>
find them because they're too easy.<br/>
<br/>
I favor this approach more for our own enjoyment than as a deterrent <br/>
to vandalism. I still have strong doubts about the bogeyman stalker. <br/>
It seems much more likely to me that boxes are vandalized by people <br/>
who stumble upon them in fairly public locations. If there really is <br/>
anyone out there who is enjoys such search and destroy outings, <br/>
difficult clues may only feed into his enjoyment. But I still say, <br/>
the trickier, the better.<br/>

    The simple way is a charity walk for a local charity. Nice set of stamps<br/>
easy walking. Do it through a school  Primary is a good idea. I have a walk<br/>
going out in March and have already had over 100 enquiries since we told<br/>
parents about it in the last news letter. They do the walk and then want<br/>
more. And on it goes.<br/>

Subject: [L-USA] Generating Interest in the Hobby<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;What ideas does anyone have about generating interest in the hobby?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think most of us have tried this way:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Tell your friends about it.<br/>
&gt;     Try to stir up interest locally.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I still think this is essential and I prefer it to web advertising.<br/>
&gt;When I meet<br/>
&gt;someone who I think may be interested I tell them to go to the web page<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;find out more about it (I've done this with about a dozen people over<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;last 9 months).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anyone have any other ideas?  What about having a brochure to<br/>
&gt;hand out?  I'm thinking something colorful, simple, perhaps using<br/>
&gt;animated<br/>
&gt;graphics- something that folds open to a map that looks like a treasure<br/>
&gt;hunt<br/>
&gt;or something along that line.  It could have links and information about<br/>
&gt;who<br/>
&gt;to contact or where to go to get supplies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Is anyone in our group involved in promotion, advertising or publishing?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Jus' thinkin' out loud...<br/>
&gt;Dan<br/>
