I'll just tell you the time it took me to find 'em. <br/>
Stone Mtn. Park series-Strength 1 hour, Eagle's Home half hour.<br/>
Easter Egg-1 hour. <br/>
Peace Crane- 2 hours. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, Ryan's Stone Mtn. Box is missing, and that's noted in the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps you some,<br/>

it out) and can be gotten after dark too!! :-)<br/>
<br/>
The Latta Park boxes in Charlotte, NC are off of I-77 about 15 to 20 <br/>
minutes N of I-85 and then require about an hour or so of walking <br/>
around the park. (Also, Dogwood and Noah's Ark are missing and won't <br/>
be replaced until later this month)<br/>
<br/>
The Father's Day Box in Steele Creek is quick and easy. The Visitor <br/>
is also in the same park, although I haven't gotten that one yet,it <br/>
was hidden in February of this year. <br/>
Also Max'a Birthday box is in the same general area. (these are store-<br/>
bought stamps)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And that about does it for quick boxes in the Charlotte area. <br/>
Oh, the Observer Box (if you can figure out that clue)<br/>
