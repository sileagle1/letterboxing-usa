As a matter of fact, I was going onto the site to report that I had taken it on Monday, 7/12. I have not placed it anywhere yet. I thanked the Maplines for leaving it there on Saturday, since they had already stamped into it previously. Since it has already been in CT, I was thinking I would drop it off in NJ or PA next weekend. Do you want it before I leave on Friday? Let me know, and we can meet somewhere.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We received this Hitch Hiker back from BeepBeep88 and TomJerry92.<br/>
It seems like it just got stuck in CT this last year.  Confererate and <br/>
Confederate's family shared the HHer and her log. ShadyLady then <br/>
Dulcimer Dame on 9/16/07 logged in.<br/>
On 8/16/08 Lara and David logged in and finally on 8/24/08 BeepBeep88 <br/>
and Tomjerry92 found her and sent her back to us.<br/>
<br/>
Many new boxers may be scratching their heads and wondering about this <br/>
HHer, but she was started on 9-11-2002. A little different method was <br/>
used with this HHer and that sometimes gets confusing to new boxers.<br/>
<br/>
The location where she is left should be posted on a chatlist.<br/>
Unfortunately this past year she languished in one spot.<br/>
<br/>
For previous years log listings see message numbers, #34174, <br/>
#46814,#57329,#61169. To access those messages just go to "Messages" <br/>
and type in the number you might read them over on this day.<br/>
<br/>
9-11-2001 must be remembered and those that sacrificed so much on that <br/>
day should be honored along with our Liberty.<br/>
