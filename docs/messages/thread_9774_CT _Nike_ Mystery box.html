&gt; Nike Missile Site Letterbox<br/>
&gt; Location: Somewhere in CT<br/>
&gt; Planted by: Pam<br/>

&gt; Difficulty: Easy Clues to figure out, Easy quick letterbox!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This letterbox is placed at one of my favorite places to watch my <br/>
church <br/>
&gt; softball team play.  During the cold war, this site was a Nike <br/>
Missile Radar <br/>
&gt; site, and later was a ski slope.  Now, the military buildings house <br/>
such <br/>
&gt; businesses as a ballet school and a day care center, and it is also <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; recreation area, with a lighted baseball field and tennis courts.  <br/>
Once you <br/>
&gt; enter this area, park down by the military buildings.  Walk up the <br/>
hill on <br/>
&gt; the paved road between the slate blue and mustard colored <br/>
buildings.  When <br/>
&gt; you get to the top of the hill, you will notice a dirt section to <br/>
your left <br/>
&gt; and tennis courts to your right.  Start walking on the dirt section <br/>
to your <br/>
&gt; left.  This is the top of the old ski slope.  You will notice four <br/>
electrical <br/>
&gt; poles going down the center of the hill, with the last two having <br/>
single <br/>
&gt; wheels on them.  This was the ski lift.  After those four, you will <br/>
find <br/>
&gt; three more with double wheels on them.  Go to the second double <br/>
wheeled <br/>
&gt; electrical pole.  You will find your prize next to the pole <br/>
underneath a flat <br/>
&gt; rock.<br/>
