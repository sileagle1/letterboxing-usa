Moderate.*** Please bring a pen  and <br/>
stamppad.                                                             <br/>
           To solve the Geometry Frog mystery, you must begin by <br/>
going to a certain small town somewhere around central Ohio. This <br/>
town has a population of around 13,485 people. The community has a <br/>
popular festival each year--perhaps you or someone in your circle of <br/>
friends has been to it. If not, don't let your hopes be squashed-- <br/>
there is always next October. Once you find the correct town, you <br/>
will then have to decide which highway to take out of town.In <br/>
providing "mystery box" clues,it's always sort of a  catch-22 <br/>
deciding how specific to get.But even if the clues are a bit <br/>
difficult,as sure as the sun rises in the east, somebody is bound to <br/>
figure them out.Anyway, when you are on the proper highway, heading <br/>
in the proper direction, you should notice a sign, about 1.7 miles <br/>
out of town, which indicates a nearby state park. Go to that park.(If <br/>
you've worked up a thirst by now, perhaps you could stop along the <br/>
way for a coffee or soda--I think that an A&amp;W would be just the right <br/>
thing).Once in the park, you need to find an area with four benches <br/>
facing a large rock which bears a plaque in memory of a certain state <br/>
employee. If you stand in front of the rock, facing the plaque, the <br/>
letterbox is about 4 feet to your right at the base of an evergreen <br/>
shrub.<br/>
