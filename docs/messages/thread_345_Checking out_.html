To All:

<br/>...Dan has made it clear to me that as long as I am still going <br/>
"the commercial route with letterboxing" I would not fit in here.
</p><p>Well, this is a tad inaccurate.  It is the commercial stuff that
<br/>does not fit here.  Eric, the person is as welcome as anybody.
<br/>At least that's what I meant by whatever I told him.
</p><p>I don't think it is difficult to see that this is a non-commercial,
<br/>non-profit site.  Using this talk list to plug ILC which itself
<br/>is a commercial site is the same as a commercial.  I doubt
<br/>that there is one person who wants that.  The core group of
<br/>people that make up this talk list were very negative to
<br/>commercialization last October when we separated from ILC.
</p><p>It was a truly defining moment for us as a group!
</p><p>I was hurt and disappointed when I saw Eric's post because I
<br/>realized that he is still intent on making money on this.  That's
<br/>not what its about IMO.  I think he's missing it.
</p><p>You who are here are here for one basic reason:  Letterboxing.
<br/>The creative juices among you go to making letterboxing
<br/>better.  And you are a diverse group.  Some of you do
<br/>stamp art, some do graphics, some do web design, some
<br/>do maps (esp. me).  We all make contributions one way or
<br/>another.  And some of you listen and wait and that's OK too
<br/>since we're not in much of a hurry (except for the 50 by Y2K
<br/>crowd and that's OK too).
</p><p>Eric, I'll say this again:  You are welcome, but to make contributions
<br/>and suggestions: in general to contribute to the hobby and to get on
<br/>track with the other people here, not to do commercials for ILC.
<br/>ILC is your business, but letterboxing for us is a fun time away from
<br/>our businesses.  Its no fun being required to talk about dues,
clues
<br/>access, databases, promotions, etc...  These are meant to do one
<br/>thing: make money.
</p><p>A database would be nice for other reasons, and eventually we will
<br/>have one.  But I can promise you something:  It will not
be used
<br/>for demographics or mailing out bills or promotions for selling stuff.
<br/>This organization is strictly non-profit and it will not be used for
<br/>commercial reasons.
</p><p>So, again, I just want to point out (mainly to list members) I did not
<br/>give Eric the boot from our talk list.  I did not even ask him
to leave.
<br/>I merely asked him to not use the list to promote ILC or his talk
<br/>list as long as they continue to serve commercial purposes.
</p><p>If Eric wants to join in the fun he will be welcomed by me and I hope
<br/>everyone else.
</p><p>But this is something to bear in mind:  Its been my experience
that the
<br/>commercial side of anything is no fun.  I don't think it was meant
to be
<br/>fun.  ILC is a business (at least it is today as we speak), and
its proprietor,
<br/>Eric Mings is a business man.  Its possiblt that may change. 
But for now
<br/>that's the way it is.
</p><p>So for that reason, and the fact that we are here to have fun and not
<br/>to argue the finer points of ILC's vision, (which is admittedly strictly
<br/>a commercial one), then I think we should let the recent discussion
with
<br/>Dr. Mings confirm for us what we started with in October: a strictly
<br/>commercial-free, bunch of fun-seekers intent on creating letterboxing
<br/>fun for ourselves and anyone else who is interested.
</p><p>Sincerely,
<br/>Daniel
