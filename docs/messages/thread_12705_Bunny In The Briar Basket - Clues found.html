Here are the clues, retrieved from the Message Board archives.<br/>

Bunny In The Briar Basket<br/>
<br/>
It is Spring, a time to rejuvenate and celebrate new life. You <br/>
Inspire My Spirit and her grandson H.P.'s Lightening Bolt, decided to <br/>
celebrate new life by hiding a letterbox. On Tuesday April 17, 2001 <br/>
the `Bunny in the Briar Basket' box was planted by `You Inspire My <br/>
Spirit, H.P.'s Lightening Bolt, Mom, and brother Connor. It took us <br/>
some time to develop the idea and to find exactly the right spot for <br/>
avid letterboxers. So this is not too easy and not too hard because <br/>
this is a box you will want to find.<br/>
If you follow the clues you will have a delightful time with this one <br/>
and you will have the opportunity of visiting historical sites as <br/>
well as environmental and literature sites <br/>
TIME: This will depend on how much you want to sightsee and take in <br/>
along the way.<br/>
DIFFICULTY: Moderate<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
Answer the following questions to find the town or city in which the <br/>
letterbox is located.<br/>
Town: What is a Rueben? (Name of town)<br/>
Location: What does Superman wear? + Kind of a fish.<br/>
This year it would be different for Peter Rabbit. This year he would <br/>
not get into trouble during school vacation. This year Peter would <br/>
follow the rules for rabbits. Peter Rabbit lives in a house in town <br/>
on a small lake with his other friends. Sometimes when Peter gets <br/>
bored and his friends are all busy; Peter goes for a walk around <br/>
town. This Spring Day, it was threatening to rain, Peter decided to <br/>
leave his home and walk towards the old Grist Mill and see what was <br/>
happening there.<br/>
As Peter approached the Grist Mill he noticed a lot of tourists <br/>
trying to get fresh `spring water'. Peter was much too interested in <br/>
his hunt to stop and be friendly and continued on his path to the <br/>
left of the Grist Mill. After a bit Peter found a large black iron <br/>
gate that led into an old cemetery. Peter thought to himself `I can <br/>
have lots of fun in here' hopping from stone to stone and hiding from <br/>
everyone. And that is what Peter did. Once Peter tired of this game <br/>
of hopping and hiding he decided to get back on the sidewalk and go <br/>
home.<br/>
Peter was feeling a bit sad that day but got the gleam back in his <br/>
eye when he met You Inspire My Spirit and H.P.'s Lightening Bolt on <br/>
the path back to his home. Peter saw them having so much fun and <br/>
wanted to play with them. Peter hopped right up to them and asked if <br/>
he could play.<br/>
You Inspire My Spirit and H.P.'s Lightening Bolt smiled and told <br/>
Peter that they were on their way to a place where animals could run <br/>
and play freely, and where lot's of sticky stuff was made and sold <br/>
to `preserve' nature.<br/>
Peter Rabbit hopped onto the back of You Inspire My Spirit's car and <br/>
enjoyed the ride out of town to Discover a Hill where Briar Patches <br/>
prevailed. Peter was sooo excited, he could hardly contain himself. <br/>
You Inspire My Spirit, H.P's Lightening Bolt, Mom and Connor started <br/>
to hike once the car was parked in the parking lot high on the hill.<br/>
While many trails seemed just so inviting on this Spring Day all <br/>
voted on taking the "Briar Patch Trail" to the "Steep Hill Trail" on <br/>
the right which led to the "Discovery Loop Trail". Peter Rabbit kept <br/>
scurrying in front of the group distracting them with his antics. The <br/>
group yearned to reach the end of the trail to see what surprise they <br/>
might find only to discover that Peter had led them in a half circle <br/>
back to the "Briar Patch Trail". A bit tired and feeling lost, the <br/>
group continued to follow Peter on the "Briar Patch Trail" to the <br/>
second "Locust Hill Trail" on the right.<br/>
Once on the "Locust Ridge Trail", Peter stopped to read the signs <br/>
along the path. One of the signs was in front of a grove of trees. <br/>
Peter shuddered at the thought of what this sign told him hurricanes <br/>
can do. Wipe away trees. Peter loved trees and well would probably <br/>
have been known in today's terms to be an environmentalist. Peter <br/>
decided to take a moment and inspect one of the `locust' trees or was <br/>
it an apple tree that was showing the effects of weathering and was <br/>
now lying down to take a rest.<br/>
This tree had an open space in it  a perfect place for a bunny to <br/>
live. In fact when Peter looked inside the open space under some logs <br/>
he found an unusual container. Peter thought for a moment and then <br/>
opened the container and found some notes, a notebook, a stamp pad <br/>
and `The Bunny in the Briar Basket'. Peter was introduced at that <br/>
moment to letterboxingHow excited Peter was to find this and to <br/>
know that many people would be visiting one of his favorite nature <br/>
spots.<br/>
You Inspire My Spirit, H.P.'s Lightening Bolt, Peter Rabbit, Mom and <br/>
Connor invite you to visit this spot. We ask you to be very careful <br/>
not to let other critters and humans note what you are doing as these <br/>
trails are sometimes very well traveled.<br/>
Once you have stamped in continue along the trail and you will note a <br/>
Glacial Ridge --- stop and ponder the wonder of it all.. you will <br/>
also note that once a grove of trees existed on the opposite side of <br/>
the trail that was wiped away by the hurricane of 1938. <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your day or half day and please do not get caught in the <br/>
Thorns, with Bugs and Peter. ;)<br/>
With deep appreciation to Lonemasswolf for all of his support, <br/>
guidance, and enthusiasm for this wonderful sport of Letterboxing. A <br/>
special thanks to Mom and Connor for accompanying us on this special <br/>
day.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks! YIMS, the planter, is a wonderful lady and I'm glad to see <br/>
her clues back. <br/>
<br/>
For those who are worried about us loosing a few letterboxes with the <br/>
change over, never fear. Each and every one is a dear treasure and <br/>
we'll bend over backwards to make sure they all find a new home.<br/>
<br/>
Many many thanks to everyone who has taken the time to add their own <br/>
letterboxes to the new website.<br/>
