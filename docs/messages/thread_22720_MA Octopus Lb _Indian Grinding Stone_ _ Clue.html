                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Indian Grinding Stone Letterbox has been placed.  It is an <br/>
Octopus style letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
The criteria for an Octopus letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
1. The clues refer to an area, not the exact route to the letterbox.  <br/>
Clues (or additional letterboxes) may be planted, in the defined <br/>
area, to lead people to the main letterbox.<br/>
2. The area is well defined.<br/>
3. Environmental impact. (none if possible)  Another usual statement <br/>
here would be "Do not leave the trails until a clue tells you where <br/>
to go."<br/>
<br/>
This placement is ideal for small areas.  It can be used in larger <br/>
parks by making the defined area smaller; example, "look for clues on <br/>
the Acorn Trail" or "Look for clues within 75 feet of Round Pond" <br/>
or "Great Brook Park, East of Lowell Road".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox has clues hidden in a variety of places.  The compass <br/>
bearing you need (step 5) is either: 30, 150, 240 or 300.<br/>
<br/>
Well, ..  how much detail did you expect?  You did not even open a <br/>
letterbox to get this clue. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck in your travels,<br/>

PS The text of this Octopus letterbox follows:<br/>

Indian Grinding Stone<br/>
<br/>
Driving Instructions<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox can be done from any parking area in Great Brook Farm <br/>
State Park in Carlisle, MA.  A $2.00 fee will be charged until after <br/>
November first.  <br/>
<br/>
Free Parking Instructions<br/>
Start from Chelmsford Center and proceed south on Route 4 until you <br/>
see Southbridge School on the left, then take the next right.  Follow <br/>
the left edge of the pavement until a road dead-ends at the parking <br/>
area for Chelmsford's Thanksgiving Forest.  (Obviously, if the left <br/>
edge of the pavement makes a turn, so do you (one turn).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You will need:  Compass with degrees, pencil, one or more clues <br/>
(unless you know the location of the Ruined Gazebo), paper, ruler, <br/>
and Great Brook Farm Trail Map.<br/>
<br/>
Octopus style clues are used.  Most people will want to find <br/>
additional clues prior to seeking the Grinding Stone.  <br/>
Defined Area:  Great Brook Farm State Park, East of Lowell Road.<br/>
Environmental Impact:  Do not move rocks.  Please stay on trails and <br/>
paths at all times.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues Start Here<br/>
1.	Obtain a trail map.  (The best supply is in front of the Ice <br/>
Cream Stand.)<br/>
2.	Find the Indian Grinding Stone (over 1 m. high, over 4 m. <br/>
long)  Clues are available in many locations.<br/>
3.	Put a dot on the trail map where the Indian Grinding stone is <br/>
located.<br/>
4.	Align the map with your compass so that N on the map is N on <br/>
the ground.  Draw a 60 mm (2 3/8 inches) line on a compass bearing  <br/>
of (see step five), and put a new point at the end of your line.  <br/>
This is the location of a 4 meter high boulder.<br/>
5.	You seem to need a clue here, maybe there are clues at some <br/>
of my other letterboxes.  There are great clues at the Ruined Gazebo, <br/>
but equivalent clues can be obtained in other locations.<br/>
6.	The letterbox is located near a 4 meter high boulder.  Along <br/>
the trail: a bit North of the boulder is a man-made object you might <br/>
find useful;  A bit south of the 4 m.boulder is a 7 meter long <br/>
boulder.<br/>
7.	From the boulder follow a small path North that is along an <br/>
old stonewall.  Ten meters from the boulder, check the stonewall.  <br/>
The stamp is a bit fragile, since it is made from Speedy-Cut.  Please <br/>
re-hide &amp; cover the letterbox, since it is on a path.<br/>
<br/>
-----------End of Clues------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
a.	The Indian Grinding Stone is not on the map, but it on a <br/>
trail.  It is a 1 meter high, 4+ meter long boulder that has been <br/>
split (unfortunately) into 3 sections.  A clue would be very helpful <br/>
here. <br/>
b.	The ruined Gazebo is a rejected letterbox site of mine.  It <br/>
is not visible from any trail or field.  There are two other ways to <br/>
get the information that is there.  It is not a "find" or a <br/>
letterbox.  If you already know its location, the clue is 5 meters <br/>
East of the ruins.  Please do not go off-trail randomly to search for <br/>
it.<br/>
c.	If you have most of the clues and are trained in military <br/>
style orienteering this letterbox should be easy.  For everyone else <br/>
this letterbox will be Easy, Moderate, or Difficult.  The letterbox <br/>
is toddler accessible once you know where it is.  It is also a <br/>
possible destination (area) for a walk with small children, as is the <br/>
Grinding Stone itself.<br/>
d.	Octopus clues are covered in more detail in the listing for <br/>
my "Octopus" letterbox, and in the talk group.  You should check both <br/>
areas.<br/>
e.	Please re-hide with the wood in front of it, since this box <br/>
is on a path.  Rubbermaid lids are a bit tricky, please be sure all <br/>
four corners are sealed.  (My wife assures me they are simple to use, <br/>
so if you have a wife along)  I left a pile of bark near the <br/>
letterbox, in case you need some to conceal it.<br/>
f.	Great Brook State Park is west of Thanksgiving Forest (which <br/>
is the starting pint for the "Forbidden Forest" Lb).<br/>
g.	The "Blue Cow" Lb is near the Ice Cream Stand.  For other <br/>
nearby letterboxes, and some safety information etc. refer to <br/>
the "Sirius" letterbox.<br/>
