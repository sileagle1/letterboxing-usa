<br/>
It's been a long crazy year and I thought what better way to end it than with a winter gathering.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to invite all 'boxers to join us on Saturday January 18th beginning at high noon (although ongoing after that for late comers) at the Moose Hill Wildlife Sanctuary in Sharon, MA in the Nature Center for a winter potluck.<br/>
<br/>
I will provide soft drinks and juice and an appetizer. There will also be a hot drink table with tea, instant coffee and hot cocoa. Bring along your favorite dish (and recipes! since that seems so popular!)and your letterboxing gear. There are five boxes on the sanctuary here and I will probably be hiding a box for the gathering. I will also carve an event stamp, but would encourage others to do the same.The more the merrier!<br/>
<br/>
The event will be hosted by me (Rustypuff)and CSCM, and though I work at the Sanctuary, please don't contact them for information. Just post to the list for either one of us and we will answer any questions.<br/>
<br/>
Please RSVP to me and I will keep a count of who's coming (gotta know how much soda to buy!). Also please note, pets are not allowed at the Sanctuary(sorry! - not my rule)<br/>
<br/>
I am excited to see you all (since I missed the Mystery gathering) and I hope you all have a wonderful holiday!!  (directions are below)<br/>

Hi Rustypuff,<br/>
TeamGreenDragon (there's three of us) will definatly attend (we also <br/>
missed the Mystery Gathering). We have been hoping there would be a <br/>
gathering soon. As we are close by (Taunton) I would also like to <br/>
help out in any way I can (my wife says I'm good at carrying and <br/>
moving stuff) let me know and I'd be glad to help out.<br/>

&gt; Hi all! It's me Rustypuff!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's been a long crazy year and I thought what better way to end it <br/>
than with a winter gathering.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would like to invite all 'boxers to join us on Saturday January <br/>
18th beginning at high noon (although ongoing after that for late <br/>
comers) at the Moose Hill Wildlife Sanctuary in Sharon, MA in the <br/>
Nature Center for a winter potluck.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, under the premise that the only stupid question is the one that <br/>
is not asked:<br/>
<br/>
Is the Nature Center indoors and/or heated?  This will determine <br/>
whether or not I bring any of my children.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Warrior Woman<br/>
(whose oldest children were very unhappy not to be able to attend the <br/>
Mystery Gathering or the CT Gathering)<br/>
