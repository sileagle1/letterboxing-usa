Rewarding because you get to exchange stuff, unrewarding because <br/>
there is no stamp to enter.  I then enter my find in geocaching, copy <br/>
it and add it to the back of my logbook.<br/>
  Off to one I missed yesterday,  psycomommy2003<br/>
P.S. Never rappeled, but willing to try!  <br/>

<br/>
Hubby is out hittin' a bucket of balls as I type...if it's not that <br/>
it's softball (or anything ending in 'ball')! But he also seems to <br/>
have fun with our new hobby and is more than willing to take a detour <br/>
if we're in the vicinity of a box! We bring my son's GPS with <br/>
us...you never know! D.<br/>
