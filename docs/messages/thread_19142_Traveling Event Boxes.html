Subject: [LbNA] Traveling Event Boxes<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hey, a question for the group.<br/>
&gt; I have created a PLB that's really fun, and I've already made arrangements for it to travel to an event in PA in<br/>
&gt; July. I'm thinking of holding on to it so that it can travel with me to an event in GA in August. Is there such a<br/>
&gt; thing as a traveling event box?...and if so, how do you advertise the fact that you have a box that's willing to hop<br/>
&gt; around from event to event?<br/>

There is even a traveling story box (where everyone adds to the story when <br/>
they stamp in).<br/>
<br/>
If you're looking for a gathering to try your new box out on, I'd love to <br/>
host it at our Moose Hill Mach 2 gathering on June 27.<br/>

Contact me off list if you're interested...I know it's short notice.<br/>
