                    <div class="plaintext-content">I started using P.G. in Dec. 03 and haven't looked back.  I went from <br/>
carving maybe 5 stamps a year to just finishing my 16th stamp since <br/>
using P.G.  Hints: 1)Sharp knife I've been using X-acto blades and <br/>
resharpening with one of those cheap knife sharpeners that you pull <br/>
the blade thru; It works good enough for me. 2)Trace your art work <br/>
with a fine lead pencil lay the design against the gasket and rub the <br/>
back of the paper with the back of your knife handle.  3)After the <br/>
design is transfered trace the image with a ballpoint pen.  4)After <br/>
carving the stamp "lightly" sand the design, ruff it up enough so <br/>
that the ink will transfer.  5)Use 1/8 inch thich not 1/16 I get mine <br/>
at Lowes 6" x 6" for $1.39 and its orangish-red. <br/>
I hope this helps.  I know there are better media to carve in but I <br/>
seem to like this stuff for now.<br/>
