My recommendation is to leave your GPS at home, dig out the old <br/>
compass and thinking cap, and get to carving some stamps and creating <br/>
fun and enticing clues for other letterboxers to seek out your new <br/>
series of boxes in the great state of Indiana!<br/>

I had already carved a stamp from an eraser (it took 3 tries to get it<br/>
right) that I have been using to stamp the book in geocaches, even<br/>
before I ever heard of letterboxing (or rather reminded of, I vaguely<br/>
recall the Smithsonian article). I then carved a stamp for someone<br/>
else. Then I found out about letterboxing a week or so ago, read<br/>
everything twice, printed it once, read it again, went exploring on<br/>
the letterboxing site and found this. I also carved two other stamps<br/>
that are aching to get into letterboxes and have names for the boxes<br/>
based on the carvings. I don't have locations for them yet. I was<br/>
considering having one on the balcony of my apartment, which would be<br/>
easy to get to and I could check every day, but that isn't exactly a<br/>
beautiful location for someone to look for even if there is a field<br/>
across from the apartment. I even bought a compass so I could take<br/>
part in a geocaching activity last month, so I don't have to buy<br/>
anything new to get started in letterboxing. The virtual letterbox at<br/>
a library mentioned on the site seemed like something I wanted to do<br/>
until I looked at the first clue that was nothing but gibberish <br/>
" 0k1(;4895.)6*;480062(5(:_5(._k8;) ". <br/>
That killed my interest in letterboxing for about a week since it<br/>
makes zero sense and I have no clue how to decypher it. That one clue<br/>
is keeping me from having the confidence to get involved with<br/>
letterboxing. I wonder how many other people it has scared away too? <br/>

(Funny) Only a year ago there were only <br/>
FIVE  letterboxes in Ohio !<br/>
<br/>
That has happened to some letterbox/Geocache (Hybrids ) in Ohio that<br/>
people mistake the stamp as a geocache prize.You might want to place<br/>
your letterbox in a separate container ("Ziploc") inside the geocache<br/>
marked "letterbox".<br/>

      Coming soon .... We will attend the National FFA Convention in <br/>
Louisville and  our hotel is in Indiana I will be leaving a box in <br/>
Ky, In, Pa, and Ohio on my trip plus other fun suprises! When I <br/>
return home ( CT.) I will post the clues no computer access at the <br/>
convention.    Have  fun   Leader of the Pack<br/>
