I mentioned in a previous post about starting a newsgroup about letterboxing. <br/>
 The advantages would be that all posts would be on a searchable online <br/>
archive accessible from any online computer anywhere.  It would eliminate the full <br/>
mailboxes we all get. And it would allow easy linkage of posts and responses <br/>
into threads which can be easier to follow than separate emails.<br/>
<br/>
I have since looked into the requirements for a newsgroup and the application <br/>
process looks tricky but not difficult.  It requires an application and a <br/>
discussion/waiting period followed by voting.  The voting would require us all to <br/>
send an email in a specifically prescribed manner showing our personal <br/>
interest in participating in a letterboxing newsgroup.<br/>
<br/>
I would be willing to pursue this if there was interest from the group.  I <br/>
realize I am new and believe me, I don't mean to step out of bounds here.  I'd <br/>
just like to gauge the interest level at this point and offer my services if <br/>
they can be of help to the group.<br/>
<br/>
If you are unfamiliar with newsgroups, check out this quick primer:<br/>
http://www.learnthenet.com/english/html/26nwsgrp.htm<br/>
<br/>
You can access newsgroups from many ISPs including AOL or through other free <br/>
services like Google.<br/>
<br/>
As letterboxing continues to grow, so will the amount of email in our boxes <br/>
from LBNA, LBMA, etc.  This may be a way to centralize many faqs, clue posts, <br/>
discussions and other items of interest to the letterboxing community.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing from the community regarding this matter.<br/>

really don't know anything about them, but the advantages you mention <br/>
are all available right here if you choose to access the group home <br/>

there instead.   Here (at home) all messages are archived and <br/>
available.. and, as you read messages, threads are separated and <br/>
grouped if you choose to follow them. I must be missing something <br/>
significant here. Anyone?  Are newsgroups really better? Really, I <br/>
don't know enough about them to offer an opinion. And..<br/>
 In all honesty, I really shudder at the thought of joining another <br/>
list somewhere.     CU on the trail  K*<br/>

     What you're talking about already exists elsewhere.  A newsgroup is not much more than a mailing list, cept you <br/>
have to go and look at it to get the messages and not have it sent to you.  Usenet newsgroups are open to the public <br/>
and completely open to anyone posting to, unless the newsgroup is moderated. If it is open, we will be spammed and <br/>
flooded with anyone and everyone posting things to the newsgroup that's not related.  Or, we'll be moderated which <br/>
puts a large strain on the moderators.  Having run a Newsgroup back in the '90s all I can say is, in my opinion, they <br/>
are no different than what we already have with the mailing lists.<br/>
<br/>
     I, personally, prefer a BBS (Bulletin Board System) style of forum, such as I have at my website.  It provides <br/>
the same level of what we already have on the mailing lists, and more, yet it also allows for separated discussions.  <br/>
Instead of having a bunch of different regional groups, the forum allows for sectionalized conversations, available to <br/>
all to peruse and choose which ones they want to be a part of. It allows for you to individualize the way that you <br/>
are notified of new threads and conversations, everything.<br/>

the internet.  There is one for just about every purpose.  Main <br/>
problem is that they are very prone to being spammed, mailbombed and <br/>
the like.  Most tend to be non-moderated, so you can get all sorts of <br/>
extreme gibberish on them.  While I am sure that we all appreciate <br/>
the suggestion, I am concerned about it's usefulness.  Best to let <br/>
