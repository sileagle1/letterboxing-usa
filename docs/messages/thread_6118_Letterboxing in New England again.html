                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>Another fruitful day on the trails, with one exception. We had to leave a site for the first time without having found the box.
<br/>
<br/>Our day started at Chesterfield Gorge, NH. Having an excuse to go back to this park (after a nine year absence) was quite a treat. We followed the directions to the first box, and we're pretty sure we were at the right place, but couldn't find the box. We're going to have to go back for that one, but since there are a bunch of boxes up in that area, we know we'll be back soon. On the way back, we found the second box in excellent condition, and stamped in. 
<br/>
<br/>Off to Shelbourne Falls, and the High Ledges. This one was very easy to get to.You can practically drive all the way to the box! Quick walk, great view, and the box was in excellent shape. Next up, the Dragonfly in Ashfield. Another quick walk to a great view of the Berkshires. Gotta love the Trustees of the Reservations! Box was in excellent shape, but watch the prickle bushes!
<br/>
<br/>The last stop of the day was a brand new box, the Keystone Bridge. Having just been to Bear's Den the day before, and not wanting to pass up the chance to be the first stampers, we had to go back to New Salem to get this one! This one was the quickest find we've had yet, very close to the trailhead. And, lucky for us, the rain that had threatened all day and finally started while on the way here, stopped just long enough for us to stamp in and get back to the car.
<br/>
<br/>We also had the great good fortune to find our first hitchhiker. The Blizzard of 2001 has been moved to a new home. It's been all over New England at this point. Wonder where it could be heading next? Did we replant it somewhere today? Or do we still have it, ready to go with us on our next adventure? 
<br/>
<br/>We're not telling. :-P
