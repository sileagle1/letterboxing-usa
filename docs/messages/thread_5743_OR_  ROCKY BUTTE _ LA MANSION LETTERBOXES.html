The new "La Mansion" letterbox placed by Funhog contains  a beautiful<br/>
stamp and an interesting East Coast association!  This letterbox is a<br/>
must find, folks!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the coveted Rocky Butte stamp that I so envied in Amanda A. and<br/>
Ryan's logbooks is now happily stamped into our letterboxing journals.<br/>
Happy day!<br/>
<br/>
We did try for the Sandy Delta letterbox, and after hours and many<br/>
attempts beneath the three sets of three we came up empty-handed.  The<br/>
most logical trail lead into a swamp so I'm not sure where we went<br/>
wrong, unless it is just because the water levels around here are so<br/>
high lately.  We never saw a yellow warning post, either so somewhere we<br/>
went astray.  Great hike, though, and who would have known that place<br/>
was even there?  Not me, that's for sure.  Lots of letterboxing<br/>
potential there!  <br/>
<br/>
It was a hot beautiful day in the Rose City and the two letterboxes we<br/>
were able to accomplish are just lovely.  Not only are the stamps<br/>
fabulous, but the scenic vistas we were treated to on a clear, sunny<br/>
day, as well, were absolutely breathtaking.<br/>
<br/>
