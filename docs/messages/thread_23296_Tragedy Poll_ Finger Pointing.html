                    <div class="plaintext-content">Don, I must admit that there are other people being implicated in <br/>
this crime who seem to have worse alibis and shadier reputations than <br/>
you. But I'm asking my investigator to keep an eye on you just the <br/>
same. You seem just clever enough to be pulling the wool over <br/>
everyone's eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I keep insisting that my investigator concentrate on the <br/>
parties that I think are the most likely suspects, but I'm not sure <br/>
he's really listening to me. He seems to believe that clues are more <br/>
important than my suspicions. Can't he recognize the voice of reason? <br/>
He keeps telling me to stay out of it and let him do his job. I don't <br/>
know why I ever agreed to pay him on a daily basis!<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I received yet another ransom note today. This wretched <br/>
criminal just seems to be taunting me and my investigator at this <br/>
point. I wish he or she would tell me what I need to do to recover my <br/>
dear precious PZ Kut.<br/>

<br/>
I tried to be a little more accurate with the capitalization this <br/>
time, since some people were reading things into the way I presented <br/>
the text of the last few notes. As before, I will forward the note to <br/>
Mark Pepe so that he can post it on his blog if he sees fit. Not that <br/>
I trust Mr. Pepe any more than the rest of you. Everyone is a suspect!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else has any information about this crime, please come <br/>
forward... for the sake of the darling little PZ's. Imagine how you <br/>
would feel if they were your own!<br/>

other folks that knew my exact location on 4/15/2006. Plus the fact <br/>

Why have we not heard an alibi from TGD-Brian? Does his silence mark his<br/>
guilt. Has he clamed up? There are no number of explanations he could<br/>
bestow upon us, but still he remains silent. (But will undoubtedly be<br/>

First of all, thank you Dewberry for defending me.  Excellent point you<br/>
made, and since I have that Scout Letterboxing Series out there, I've<br/>
entertwined my scout life with my letterboxing life, so I certainly wouldn't<br/>
want my scouts to find their way to a list like this, only to find one of<br/>
their leaders is under scrutiny.<br/>
<br/>
And as to you, Don, I would've thought you would be more attentive to<br/>
detail!  Someone in this whole tragic affair mentioned that this could be<br/>
considered a felony offense by the very volume of the theft, so obviously it<br/>
would be FAR too much rubber to carry on a bike - nothing sinister at all<br/>
about my making that statement!  And your finger-pointing makes me continue<br/>
to believe it must be you.  Oh, I wanted to believe it wasn't, but I just<br/>
can't justify your guiltlessness in my own mind anymore...<br/>
