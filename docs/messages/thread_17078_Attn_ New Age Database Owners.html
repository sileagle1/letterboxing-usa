I removed names not only to protect the members of NewAge from <br/>
harrassment, but also because it doesn't fit the needs of the <br/>
database. I use the database to find out about trail conditions and <br/>
if a box is suitable for kids or not. Knowing who found it last is <br/>
not my concern. <br/>
<br/>
We are not doing anything wrong over at NewAge. We have every right <br/>
to talk about any box. It's just like going to the movies, then <br/>
coming home and making a website of movie reviews. All we have is a <br/>
database of box reviews, and we really only discuss the trail <br/>
conditions. I don't see a problem with that. At least we're not <br/>
telling people, "This box sucks! Don't waste your time finding it!". <br/>
I would never talk about anyone's boxes like that. And at least we're <br/>
not telling anyone where boxes are. <br/>
<br/>
*being sarcastic*<br/>
But since I keep being accused of doing unethical things, why not <br/>
just grab my GPS and go find some boxes. Then I could come home and <br/>
post the coordinates for everyone. Where's my list of mystery boxes??<br/>

IMO, intentionally placing a box in a difficult (perhaps even <br/>

unethical. I do realize there's a degree of mystery and difficulty to <br/>
letterboxing, but I think that should be in the clues themselves, not <br/>

in the park. I'd just like to know that before I set out for the box. <br/>

&gt; dangerous) location and not mentioning it in the clues is also <br/>
&gt; unethical.<br/>
<br/>
I've hidden one mystery box in particular that's at the end of a very <br/>
strenuous hike, but I don't write that in my clue.  It's my <br/>
expectation that anyone that's figured out the clue should do their <br/>
homework and research the trail and trail conditions before heading <br/>
out.  In fact, that's exactly what I do before I find somebody else's <br/>
mystery letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
And even if you can't find such information about a specific trail <br/>
online, you could always give the park rangers a call and ask about <br/>
it.  Or drop by a visitor center where they can answer such <br/>
questions.  In fact, that could be the best way of all of getting <br/>
trail conditions since they can change rapidly from day to day or a <br/>
sudden landslide might take out a trail.  The best place for up-to-<br/>
date information is probably from the people that work the area.<br/>
<br/>
It's more work that way and I rarely do that myself.  I just like to <br/>
go out for a box and if it's not there, it's not there.  No big <br/>
deal.  And if it's located somewhere I feel is unethical or <br/>
dangerous, I quit before I do whatever unethical or dangerous thing <br/>
it requires of me.  Cut my losses while I can.  Don't focus so much <br/>
on a letterbox that you miss the forest for the trees.<br/>
<br/>
And if you DO find a letterbox that you think is in a bad spot--you <br/>
should inform the person who placed the box.  Like the bolder field <br/>
you hated so much.  First, you should have turned back right there if <br/>
it was truly a problem.  Second, instead of a database everyone <br/>
hates, you could have written the person to let them know of the <br/>
issue.  Perhaps it was something they overlooked because they hadn't <br/>
considered people might take kids, but they'd be more than willing to <br/>
add that information directly to the clue.  Which would be a whole <br/>
heck of a lot more effective than putting such information in a <br/>
database that most people won't even read and tick off everyone in <br/>
the process.<br/>
<br/>
There are better solutions to the issues you're concerned about than <br/>
a database.<br/>

<br/>
Second, I didn't start the database because of this one box. In fact, <br/>
I didn't even start the original database. I thought it was a good <br/>
idea, and after you (and probably others) started messing with it, I <br/>
decide to put it someplace where not as many people could poison it. <br/>
In fact, none of you even knew about it for a long time, and did it <br/>
hurt anyone? NO! Oh, and not everyone hates the database.<br/>
<br/>
This is the last anyone will hear from me on this subject. I've <br/>
decided to end all communication about it on this list and in email. <br/>
It's gotten so ridiculous that all I can do is laugh at some of the <br/>
comments by some people. There are bigger things in life to worry <br/>
about than if one of your boxes is in a database. <br/>
<br/>
Some may find this decision immature and childish, but so is arguing <br/>
back and worth for days when it's obvious that no one is going to <br/>
change their minds. <br/>

Having carried kids through much worse things than a boulder field, on<br/>

look as threatening or dangerous until you get half way as well. Watching<br/>
older kids in your group may also lead to problems. I watched my 13 and ten<br/>
year old cross a rope bridge across some mucky areas at a certain park, only<br/>
to come across the other side with a green stinky sneaker. You can't make<br/>

would like to make happy memories, not have my kids remember the time our<br/>

I'm assuming no such thing.  I'm more practical than that.  I'm <br/>
thinking that there are two sides of an issue here.  I've listened to <br/>
the comments and thoughts of both sides and came to an educated <br/>
decision that the database isn't worth the angst it causes.  It's of <br/>
limited help.  I think it's ethically wrong if the owner has no input <br/>
about their own boxes.  And there are plenty of alternative ways to <br/>
accomplish the same thing without the conflict.<br/>
<br/>
A bad idea is still a bad idea even if it has supporters.  I wish <br/>
there was a way to make everyone happy, but apparently there's not.  <br/>
I'd rather the database go away completely--that's what I WANT--but <br/>
I'm willing to compromise and give it an okay as long as the owner of <br/>
a box has input into whether their box is in the database or not.  It <br/>
seems like a fair decision addressing the concerns of both sides of <br/>
the issue.  It may not make everyone completely happy, but it doesn't <br/>
make anyone a complete loser in this fight either.  The database <br/>
would still exist for the most part, but the conflict will go away--<br/>
or at least lessen in intensity.  <br/>
<br/>
Imagine--pulling Funhog's boxes from the database would be like <br/>
pulling the rug out from her argument.  She'd have nothing left to <br/>
stand on and fight for.  It's a pretty good coup to pull out the rug <br/>
from under Funhog and still get your way.  =)<br/>

See, this is one of the reasons that I prefer a forum over a mailing list.<br/>
But that's just my personal preference.<br/>
<br/>
I've said my peace, others have said their piece and the antagonists have<br/>
gotten their words in again. I beseech anyone who feels the need to respond<br/>
this thread to remember one thing...<br/>
