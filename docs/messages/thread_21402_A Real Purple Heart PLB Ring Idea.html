I'd love to see a true Purple Heart PLB Ring started, honoring those <br/>
brave men and women who have earned a Purple Heart in service to our <br/>
country.  People who sign up might know of someone who had received <br/>
this award.  Perhaps they could include a brief description of how <br/>
the injury was received - without mentioning names.<br/>
<br/>
It's just an idea for someone to grab.  We are away from home for <br/>
several weeks, and have never seen a PLB, so I offer the suggestion <br/>
to someone else.<br/>
