                    <html><body><p>I was finally able to include a submission form on all my web pages for fellow boxers to help me verify my letterboxes. Now that I have letterboxes in 7 different states, it becomes more difficult checking on them. My form allows fellow boxers to submit information on any of my letterboxes they may or may not find. This is of course voluntary, but much appreciated. It also gives some assurance to people thinking about searching for a letterbox to know that it's still in service and how long ago it was found. Let me know how you like or <strong>dislike</strong> it. I know this group has a wide verity of opinnons.<img src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys/3.gif"/>   Bill &amp; Craig  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/haalck@snet.net">www.geocities.com/haalck@snet.net</a> </p></body></html>
