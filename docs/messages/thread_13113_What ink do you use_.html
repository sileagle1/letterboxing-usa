                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">I use primarily dye-based inks for a couple of reasons...  first <br/>
because they dry quicker and are less prone to smudge in my log book <br/>
or the box log, and second because they don't make a mess on the <br/>
stamp.  I have come across boxes where the last visitor was several <br/>
weeks prior to me and the ink on the stamp was still wet and the <br/>
inside of the baggie was a goopy mess that I did not appreciate <br/>
sticking my hand into.<br/>
<br/>
There is truth to the fact that not all dye-based inks are waterproof <br/>
and even those that claim to be, are not completely water resistent.  <br/>
I use mostly the Ancient Page brand that you mentioned, and have <br/>
found them to be waterproof in most conditions.  The ink doesn't seem <br/>
to fade and disappear with moisture as some of the cheaper brands do, <br/>
but it does wash out if the page is totally immersed in water.<br/>
<br/>
In theory, the ink shouldn't have to be waterproof because boxes <br/>
should be hidden and packaged so that they will bot be exposed to <br/>
water.  In reality, that is not always the case...  unexpected <br/>
circumstances, weather, critters, vandals, etc.  Guess I'd rather <br/>
take that chance than deal with an inky mess every time I stamp into <br/>
a box.  <br/>
<br/>
I have used pigment inks, primarily for a specific color and because <br/>
I have an easier time finding the tiny pads in pigments, and do <br/>
occasionally include an ink pad in a box.  But one should always <br/>
remember to clean off the stamp afterward.<br/>

Unfortunately you have to buy them in sets of 12 from one of four color families.  I think one set is $21.95 for 12.  Right noq I am using Cat's Eye pigment pads.  I take an extra piece of paper along to blot before I close the log book.  I had considered taking along small pieces of tissue that I can just leave in the log 'til the next person comes.  What do people think of that idea?  Would it annoy you to find a piece of paper in the log book?<br/>

I'm thinking ahead to winter, because at the rate I'm moving it will<br/>
probably BE winter before I get started!  Yesterday was a PERFECT day to<br/>
do letterboxing.  The temps were great for hiking, it was sunny, I<br/>
didn't have any other commitments.  but do you think I could even FIND<br/>
my stamps???  I turned this house upside down.  I KNOW they're here<br/>
somewhere.  But in total frustration, I did take my furkids for a hike,<br/>
scouting out places to plant out first box.  :-)  and then I came home<br/>
and started working on a new stamp and a new identity for us - one that<br/>
covers all 3 of us.  What do you think of "The Woof Pack?"  SpringChick,<br/>
you have our picture, does that fit?  Has anyone else used that name<br/>

&gt; I've tromped through the snow to find it.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I'm thinking ahead to winter, because at the rate I'm moving it will<br/>
&gt; probably BE winter before I get started!  Yesterday was a PERFECT <br/>
day to<br/>
&gt; do letterboxing.  The temps were great for hiking, it was sunny, I<br/>
&gt; didn't have any other commitments.  but do you think I could even <br/>
FIND<br/>
&gt; my stamps???  I turned this house upside down.  I KNOW they're here<br/>
&gt; somewhere.  But in total frustration, I did take my furkids for a <br/>
hike,<br/>
&gt; scouting out places to plant out first box.  :-)  and then I came <br/>
home<br/>
&gt; and started working on a new stamp and a new identity for us - one <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; covers all 3 of us.  What do you think of "The Woof Pack?"  <br/>
SpringChick,<br/>
&gt; you have our picture, does that fit?  Has anyone else used that name<br/>
&gt; that you can remember?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; ????  (formerly MommaDi)<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I was wondering what inks everyone uses.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One article on letterboxing I saw said to use dye based ink.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I could understand that pigment inks (Colorbox &amp; others) take <br/>
longer <br/>
&gt; to dry &amp; could smear.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, water based dye based inks are not very waterproof!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am brand new -- F1 P0 as of yesterday!! -- and I took a very <br/>
little <br/>
&gt; pad of Ancient Page.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ancient Page is an "acid free, archival, waterproof" dye ink.  <br/>
These <br/>
&gt; pads are 2-1/4 inches by 1-1/2 inches, so they fit great in small <br/>
&gt; places.  The pads are raised so they can ink any size pad.  Can you <br/>
&gt; tell I've been a hard core stamper for many years?!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyhoo, it worked great for me.  I wanted to share &amp; ask everyone <br/>
&gt; else what brand you use.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for your input!<br/>

first box we found "Chili Ristra" had a stamp literally covered in <br/>
thick green goo.  Yuck.  Fortunately, I had paper towel with me and <br/>
was able to clean it off.  I didn't want the green goo in my book, <br/>
hands, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Just a note that we should all try to make sure that when we put a <br/>
stamp away that it is somewhat clean?  A scrap of paper towel isn't <br/>
much (baby wipes work better) to carry along with you.  <br/>

Just as an fyi - be sure the babywipes are securely closed if you <br/>
take them.  We had some in our backpack and they leaked all over <br/>
everything.  Thankfully only one of the stamps in the logbook really <br/>
suffered any damage.  <br/>

Today, in a blinding storm of mental clarity, I KNEW exactly where my<br/>
stamps are!  So I'm NOT going to do a whole new identity, I'm remaining<br/>
MommaDi, but together, with my furkids Josh and Trav'ler, we will be<br/>
stamping and signing in as The Woof Pack.  Starting tomorrow!!!!!!<br/>

I had a few boxes with ink pads in them over the winter last year...  <br/>
both dye and pigment and they all survived fine.<br/>

BTW, I like the "Woof Pack."<br/>

Losing and dropping the covers always drives me nuts too.  Plus, we try and <br/>
secure them with rubber bands so they don't all fall off in the back pack <br/>
and get ink all over everything!<br/>
<br/>
I just started getting these Stamping Up ink pads (I think someone else <br/>
mentioned their little dot pads).  The regular sized pads have covers that <br/>
retract and slide underneath -- how cool is that?!!  They have tons of <br/>
colors and seemed to be on par price-wise with Michaels.  Plus, since the <br/>
cover is out of the way and not attached at one side, it doesn't interfere <br/>
with inking up at all!  BeMa<br/>
