somewhere close in Virginia. That was a couple of months ago. Not <br/>
heard from it since.<br/>
<br/>
I started using that as my first signature stamp then got into <br/>
carving and put it out as a HH here in CA Central Coast. Amanda from <br/>
Seattle took it to the East. <br/>
<br/>
I went up on the HH Board but no luck there. Just thought I would ask <br/>
to whence and wither my Cooties have spread. <br/>
