                    <div class="plaintext-content">The minibox is 2 canisters held together with a piece of clear <br/>
packing tape around the "tube" formed by putting the canisters next <br/>
to each other.  I put the log in one canister and in the other have <br/>
room for a stamp and a home made stamp pad. For all users:  This <br/>
works best if the back of the stamp is put next to the back of the <br/>
stamp pad... NOT by mashing the pad and stamp together. <br/>
<br/>
I make the log by creating a scroll like pad which rolls up inside <br/>
the canister.  The pages of the log are 1" x 4.25" (made from 1" <br/>
strips of paper cut from an 8 1/2 x 11 inch piece of paper).  The <br/>
first page has the box stamp and stamp details.  The second page is a <br/>
short explanation about letterboxing.  The remaining 12 or so pages <br/>
are blank.  This gives room for about 20 letterboxers to stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
The micro box is similar, except that it just contains a log and a <br/>
stamp, and all is contained in one canister.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes hide well under rocks near trails and in dark children's <br/>
size socks hung in the branches of cedar and pine trees.  (I call <br/>
these cocoons.)  If any of the weight of the rock is allowed to rest <br/>
on the canister, it will smash when it gets hot outside and then <br/>
leak.  Other than that they seem quite waterproof.   <br/>
