                    <div class="plaintext-content">Has anyone tried or heard about Ultimate Treasure Hunters? Some of my <br/>
friends did it last weekend, and it sounded pretty cool. You sign up for a <br/>
treasure hunt and they send you clues and then you go out and try to find <br/>
the treasure (not on line, but real life). Whoever finds it first wins a <br/>
cash prize. My friends said that it involved quite a bit of hiking and that <br/>
the clues were pretty challenging, but it sounded like a lot of fun. Does <br/>
anyone know what parts of the country it is available in?<br/>
