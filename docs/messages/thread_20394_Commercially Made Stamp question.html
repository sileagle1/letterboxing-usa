used to say.  Try something very simple. A few lines<br/>
on an eraser can  be just the sugestion of an image<br/>
and be a really cool stamp. I personaly don't like<br/>
finding comercial stamps but that's just me. Carving<br/>
takes practice and not everyone is an artist. My<br/>
carving is improving but it's not great. Letterboxing<br/>
means many things to many different people, don't get<br/>
caught up in making the perfect box .  Carving is only<br/>
one part. You may find you are much better at writing<br/>
clues.To quote a famous boxer "just get out there and<br/>
box"!<br/>

P.S. Where are you from? I'm in PA and  have about 8<br/>
or 9 stamps ready to go but have not had time to<br/>
plant. I might be interested in an exchage of some<br/>
sort.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are lots of places that will make a polymer rubber stamp from<br/>
your design. Look them up in your local yellow pages under<br/>
"Stationery" or "Rubber Stamps" There are also a few places online<br/>
where you can email designs to make stamps. Its very easy and only<br/>
costs $5-$10 to make your own.<br/>
