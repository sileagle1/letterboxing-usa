Hi Y'all,<br/>
<br/>
I am very new, and just finished carving my first stamp. I have **NO** artistic ability, none, so it is a simple one. I do have a question about mounting. I have read conflicting advice about the need for a coushin before mounting on a block og wood. I was thinking of raiding my youngest daughters craft supplies for the flat foam stuff she has and using that. Do you think that would work?<br/>
<br/>
I cannot wait to go find boxes.<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to this enjoyable hobby. Glad you are already working on your<br/>
stamp. Mounting is a personal preference, between cushions, types of<br/>
mounts, adhesive, etc. Foam will work, but it won't be as durable as<br/>
say wood. But if you're in a hurry, just use the foam. Some folks I<br/>
know use those thin cutting boards as a backer, cut down for sizing of<br/>
course.<br/>

Perhaps, some of the conflicting advise you have been getting may <br/>
come from people who have not carved their own stamps, but do have <br/>
experience with comercially produced unmount rubber stamps. <br/>
<br/>
Those kind of machine made stamps quite often are made of a very thin <br/>
valcanized rubber material. They will give their best impression if <br/>
they have some kind of "cushion" to work with. (Either between the <br/>
stamp and the wood/mounting surface or under the paper being stamped <br/>
on.)<br/>
<br/>
Most of the materials used for carving letterbox stamps are <br/>
sufficently thick that they don't need any cushion. However, they <br/>
will last longer and be easier to use if you do mount them.<br/>
<br/>
I have a few stamps mounted to the thick style of fun foam. They've <br/>
been "out there" for several months and so far are holding up well. <br/>
Using the fun foam was an idea I got from someone on this list.<br/>
<br/>
However, the material I most often use to mount my stamps to is <br/>
posterboard. I have a stamp mounting tutorial, with photos, at our <br/>
picture trail site. www.picturetrail.com/bindle_boxers<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
