<div>To all you "boxious" folks out there. The Ledyard, CT 
letterbox "Walk in Whitehall" has been repaired with a new much more waterproof 
container. The contents from the old container (coffee can) will be kept at the 
letterboxing info center at the Waterford, CT Eastern Mountain Sports 
store.</div>
<div>Apart from that, I must say that "Panic" was quite an 
adventure today and before I found the whitehall box I had an interesting yet 
one-sided conversation with a LARGE snapping turtle crossing the path just after 
the bridge. He was an old fella and his shell measured about a foot in diameter. 
After Whitehall, it was down the road to the Ledyard Oak. You can imagine how 
large the canopy of that tree was if you note the size of the clearing that the 
"skeleton" resides in. And, who let loose the maniac with the blue paint????
