                    <div class="plaintext-content">I posted earlier to the postal LB list and haven't heard anything.  <br/>
Does anyone know anything at all about the Mountain High Postal <br/>
Letterboxes?  I was so excited to see them back, but I'm worrying I <br/>
won't now.  It has been forever since I have heard anything on either <br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
Even if it has been a while since you saw them, could you let me know <br/>
if you have received them ever (and let me know when).  I had a list <br/>
of emails from people who had received it, but it is on my computer <br/>
that crashed and I no longer have access to it.  I would like to try <br/>
to track them down, but I worry they are hopelesly lost.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>
