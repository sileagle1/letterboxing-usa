Where are you?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; how do I go about figuring out what are good clues?<br/>
&gt; I mean so it isn't too easy but still findable?<br/>
<br/>
Read through various clues of other letterboxes, even if they are not <br/>
in your area... it will still give you an idea of the variety of ways <br/>
you can write your clues.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; How well hidden does it need to be?<br/>
<br/>
It should be hidden well enough that a casual passerby would not see <br/>
it, but a person following the clues does not have to uproot trees <br/>
and blast apart stone walls to find it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I feel a little edgy just leaving a small box somewhere<br/>
&gt; and walking off....what keeps people from finding it<br/>
&gt; and taking it?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they do, but usually if it is clearly labeled and you have <br/>
included some letterboxing info sheets inside the box for the curious <br/>
ones, they will leave it alone.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to get a comfort level is to read other clues and the <br/>
FAQ's and then just...  do it!<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

Find a place hidden from view.  You shouldn't be able to see it when you <br/>
leave your box.  Check out other clues you have followed.  Although I have <br/>
only planted 1 box.  I learned that I probably will have to do a better job <br/>
of editing my directions before I submit them.  Since I mixed up my left and <br/>
rights.  My first box was in a park I go to often and Ijust chose a place <br/>
that was out of the way there.  Clues can be easy or hard. I wanted to make <br/>
the clues to my box longer then it really was. As was pointed out to me. <br/>
Some people love a short easy box to find and Some love a long hike.  I <br/>
think I will try to make my next 2 little easer to write the clues.  Hope <br/>
this helps<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; how do I go about figuring out what are good clues?<br/>
<br/>
Typically I wouldn't encourage such a thing, but if there really <br/>
aren't many letterboxes in your area, the best clue might be as <br/>
simple, straight-forward as possible so nobody will have trouble <br/>
finding it.<br/>
<br/>
Think of it like this: If there aren't any letterboxes in your area, <br/>
anyone (locally, at least) who tries to look for it will be novices <br/>
at the hobby.  They'll be thrilled to death to find the box <br/>
regardless of how 'easy' the clues are.  So give them a few easy <br/>
boxes to find before challenging them with something a more <br/>
difficult.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Once the "letterboxing base" has been established, you can start <br/>
thinking up more creative and elaborate clues to challenge those <br/>
folks that want a challenge.  Whenever I'm the first in an area to <br/>
hide a letterbox, I'll delibrately make the clues as easy as possible-<br/>
-and the hike as easy as possible too!--so everyone in the area won't <br/>
have any troubles finding the boxes.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; How well hidden does it need to be?<br/>
<br/>
Basically, you want to hide it where it's highly unlikely it'll EVER <br/>
be discovered by accident.  You'll also have to consider seasonal <br/>
changes.  That thick bush you think is a great place to hide a box <br/>
may not be so great in the wintertime when all the leaves fall off.  <br/>
Under a rock near that babbling brook may not be such a hot idea when <br/>
spring run-offs turn it into a raging river and floods the box away.  <br/>
Under that nice, sunny looking rock in the winter time may not be <br/>
such a hot idea when you go back in the summer to discover the area <br/>
is thick with poison oak.  (I'm guilty of that, sad to say.)  So <br/>
there's a couple of considerations to keep in mind--particularly <br/>
seasonal factors and making sure it won't be found by accident.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I feel a little edgy just leaving a small box somewhere and walking<br/>
&gt; off....what keeps people from finding it and taking it?<br/>
<br/>
Nothing, really, and it does happen occasionally.  It's especially in <br/>
danger if it's in a well-traveled location that's likely to be <br/>
discovered accidentally.  Most people LOOKING for the letterbox enjoy <br/>
the hobby and wouldn't ruin it by stealing boxes.  It's the <br/>
accidental finder that's the biggest worry.  They might think the box <br/>
is trash and be a "helpful citizen" by packing it out thinking it's <br/>
garbage!  You can't really get mad at those people--they're only <br/>
trying to make the world a better place to live--which is why you <br/>
really want to make sure it won't be discovered by accident.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with all your future letterboxes!  =)<br/>

This has actually happened to one of my letterboxes. The folks had <br/>
carried it back to their car to throw it away and then they took a <br/>
look at it when they were in their car and discovered all my <br/>
information inside the box about letterboxing with the LBNA website <br/>
address. They still took the box home and visited the website before <br/>
eventually returning the box to it's original location. They then <br/>
became letterboxers! Stamped into the box and everything. <br/>
