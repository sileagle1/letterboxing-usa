<br/>Good advice, I had just that same thought while in the woods yesterday with the
<br/>little ones.  Sad it's come to having to think this way.
<br/>Take care all.

hike leader for many years, and now that I mainly letterbox, still <br/>
preach not going it alone. One of the reasons that sometimes plants a <br/>
seed is that if one 'should' fall or get in some trouble needing help, <br/>
just take a minute and think of the people that have to give up their <br/>
time to come get you. [sort of a guilt trip, but as an old one, I'm  <br/>
good at that ] Thanks for the reminder.<br/>
