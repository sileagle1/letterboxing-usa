Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I am taking orders for T-Shirts. I have created them for my local group, Letterboxing Mid-Atlantic Region, but they are available to anyone interested. Some important info:<br/>
<br/>
   I have received permission for the use of the LBNA logo on the front of the shirt. <br/>
   Orders must be pre-paid. Short sleeve and tanks are $10.00ea, Long sleeve T's $12.00. This price is includes my costs of shipping to and from the silkscreener. All shirts have a S&amp;H charge of $3.85 per shirt (USPS Priority mail). <br/>
   I would like to know by Friday 5/28 if you are interested so that I can begin getting the actual order together. I will need checks by around 6/5 but will send address info at a later date. If I don't get a total order of 75 shirts, this will not happen so I don't want anyone mailing checks until I know for sure that we have at least 75 pieces ordered. <br/>
   This is coming from a wholesaler, not a retailer so returns are not an option. Each shirt will be inspected by me for any defects and not shipped, but other than that they can not be returned because the color wasn't what you thought it would be or doesn't fit the way you thought it would. If you are a very particular person this might not be the place for you to buy your letterboxing tee. Don't misunderstand, these are Gildan 2000 tees, very nice. But they are tee's, not fitted shirts. <br/>
   I have posted 2 files to this Yahoo Group. Please go to Groups, Letterbox-usa,  Files LBMA T-shirts Info folder to view an image of what the logos look like and color/size details.<br/>
   For those of you who would like to avoid shipping costs, several of us are trying to get a camping/gathering together in or near Bucks County, Pa. we are now looking at the weekend on July 9-11. Will send more detail as we get them<br/>
<br/>
Please respond offline, thanks!<br/>

I forget to add I can get Kids tees, but we have limited sizes and colors. S-XL (youth) I can get in Ash, Natural, Gold and White. I do not know who the images will look on the smaller shirts and can't afford to have a separate set of smaller image silk screens made to accomodate the smaller shirts. It would have to be a "buyer beware" type of thing. If you need more info, let me know.<br/>
