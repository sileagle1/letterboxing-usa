<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've been letterboxing now for 6 months (geocaching for about a month),<br/>
and by far letterboxing is more fun!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Still, I think there are a few ideas geocaching.com implements on their<br/>
website that would be cool to integrate in letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1)       Have Account Members be able to track their finds (and misses)<br/>
online.  The letterboxing journal is irreplaceable, but an online<br/>
checklist would make it easier to pick that next juicy box!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2)       Consider have an online log available, as letterbox placers<br/>
can't visit their caches regularly AND seek out new boxes.  This way if<br/>
a problem arises tracked info will be associated with the box for the<br/>
placer to see online.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3)       City based distance searches would be excellent.  Of course<br/>
mystery boxes would be excluded, but even as a Pennsylvanian I don't<br/>
know where half the counties are, so it's more difficult to plan boxing<br/>
than it has to be.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4)       Allow International posts, even if they're not tidily<br/>
organized..I'm off to France shortly and it's been hell and a pack of<br/>
matches to find more than a couple boxes over there..I found about 200<br/>
geocaches in under a minute.  I plan to place a box while in Paris, but<br/>
to be honest, I don't know where I'll post it.perhaps as a Mystery,<br/>
mystery on letterboxing.org<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the end the site is very good, and I think the webmasters have done<br/>
an excellent job, but there's always room for improvement.hope my<br/>
feedback adds something to the mix! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
