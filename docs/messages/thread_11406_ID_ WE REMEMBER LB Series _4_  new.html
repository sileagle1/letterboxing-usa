WE REMEMBER LB Series (4) <br/>
<br/>
Placed by A-bear (jedaryn02@yahoo.com) on 19 March<br/>
2003 <br/>
Boise, ID <br/>
Ada County <br/>
<br/>
Directions: Take Exit 53, Vista Ave, from I84 and head<br/>
north into Boise.  Vista Ave eventually turns into<br/>
Capitol Blvd, but stay on this road.  After you cross<br/>
the Boise River turn right at Battery St. into Julia<br/>
Davis Park and another immediate right to park<br/>
somewhere between the zoo and the river.<br/>
<br/>
Description:  This series will take you about 2 hours<br/>
(plus or minus) by foot.  You can also access the<br/>
letterboxes via parking in the different parks and<br/>
deciphering the clues from there if you dont have as<br/>
much time to walk to all the points. <br/>
<br/>
Background:  WE all REMEMBER where we were on<br/>
September 11th, 2001.  I was stationed one mile from<br/>
the Pentagon and kept pretty busy throughout that day<br/>
and the days to follow.  One of my soldiers duties<br/>
was to secure the families and homes of the top<br/>
military leaders.  I am very proud of how hard they<br/>
worked and the sacrifice they made daily to protect<br/>
our freedom.  This letterbox series was placed in<br/>
honor of those we lost on that day and for all those<br/>
who continue to serve to protect our freedom.  While<br/>
the stamp carvings are not that great, I think by<br/>
finding these 4 letterboxes WE will continue to<br/>
REMEMBER.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  <br/>
#1-<br/>
In Julia Davis Park on the south side of the Boise<br/>
zoo, there is a pedestrian bridge that leads to Boise<br/>
State University.  From the north end of this bridge<br/>
take the dirt trail at 60 degrees.  About 67 paces/134<br/>
steps you will step on yet another root that has a<br/>
small sewer lid named Buckner in line with a crooked<br/>
tree about 15 feet away at 170 degrees.  In this<br/>
trees roots and behind a rock is the first WE<br/>
REMEMBER letterbox.  Take a moment to REMEMBER those<br/>
military and civilians lost in the attack on the<br/>
Pentagon.<br/>
#2-<br/>
Back on the dirt trail make your way to the bike path<br/>
that parallels your path.  Follow this path until you<br/>
come to a large pond on the left side of the road. <br/>
Keep your eye on this pond.  As you are about to<br/>
completely pass the pond, you will see a multi-trunked<br/>
tree on the right side of your path.  From it take the<br/>
small path leading down to the river bank.  Another 12<br/>
paces west along the river.  A 1986 four headed tree. <br/>
Down to its right in the concrete cove lies WE<br/>
REMEMBER letterbox.  Pause and remember those we lost<br/>
in flight over Pennsylvania.  <br/>
#3-<br/>
Return to the bike path and at any crossroads, take<br/>
the trail that sticks close to the river.  Keep on<br/>
going until you reach Muncipal Park.  As you are about<br/>
to leave Muncipal park, there will be 3 long green<br/>
picnic tables with a rock fire place and then 12<br/>
wooden pillars on the north side of your path.  At<br/>
this point, hop on the dirt path that parallels the<br/>
river and the Greenbelt path.  Continue on it east to<br/>
Warren Lovelys rock.  40 degrees to the multi-trunked<br/>
CKB tree.  Due north, see the dead huge, fallen &amp;<br/>
cut tree.  Two thirds into itself sleeps another<br/>
stump.  Cautiously reach into its hole for the next<br/>
WE REMEMBER letterbox.  Think back to the thousands<br/>
we lost in the Twin Towers in New York.<br/>
#4-<br/>
Return to the bike path and head east.   Follow the<br/>
path around the Marden Water Treatment Plant until you<br/>
come to a bridge on the western side of the Warm<br/>
Springs Golf Course.  Once across the bridge travel<br/>
west on the Greenbelt path for a while until you come<br/>
to a red pier overlooking the Boise River on your<br/>
right.  Make your way below it.  Behind the shortest<br/>
support pole under the west side, is the final WE<br/>
REMEMBER letterbox.  Our flag still stands for<br/>
freedom and no one can take that away. <br/>
