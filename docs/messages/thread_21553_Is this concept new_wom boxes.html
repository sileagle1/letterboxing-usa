wom boxes are fine, however how is a letterboxer coming into a region<br/>
where one of these boxes is located get onto the list?  For example, I'm <br/>
from nebraska and this summer I will be travelling  to oregon.  Likewise <br/>
it's highly probable we will be travelling to the Boston region within<br/>
three years.  I recommend we file these boxes in the files region of<br/>
this site as "members only letterboxes."  the fun will be making<br/>
arrangements to pick up the clue.<br/>

In a lot of cases where WOM clues are used, planters don't necessarily <br/>
care if there are hoards of finders.  Often these clues are <br/>
distributed WOM because it is a sensitive area and they don't want a <br/>
lot of visitors or to provide an extra perk for people in their region <br/>
or people they have come to know through the hobby.  The proliferation <br/>
of letterboxes over the past couple of years gives a pretty good <br/>
chance that when you travel you will have a selection of publicly <br/>
listed boxes to find, even if you don't have clues to WOM boxes in <br/>
that area.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I recommend we file these boxes in the files region of<br/>
&gt; this site as "members only letterboxes."<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't that kind of be like posting a "these are my darkest secrets" <br/>
list to your blog?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the fun will be making<br/>
&gt; arrangements to pick up the clue.<br/>
<br/>
The fun is figuring out where the WOM boxes are and getting to know <br/>
people in other areas so that you can get in on some of these clues.<br/>

thinking.  Thanks and well said SpringChick.<br/>
