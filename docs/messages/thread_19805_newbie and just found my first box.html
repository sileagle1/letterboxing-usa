                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone, just thought I'd say hi since I'm new here. I read a <br/>
reference to letterboxing in my sister's blog (a friend of hers does <br/>
it) a few days ago, and it sounded so fun! I immediately made myself <br/>
a stamp and printed out directions to several of the boxes in my town <br/>
(Santa Cruz, CA). We went looking for Queen Mab's Chaminade <br/>
yesterday. The short hike in was beautiful, but when we got there, <br/>
there was a mountain biker parked and reading a book right next to <br/>
the hiding spot. We waited around a while, but he showed no signs of <br/>
moving anytime soon, and we decided there was no way to look for the <br/>
box without him noticing, so we left w/o retrieval. We'll go back <br/>
today or sometime soon. <br/>
So we decided to look for the next one (Berserker) in the middle of <br/>
the night, to be sure no one would be around. We found it last night <br/>
and got to put our first stamps in our books!!<br/>

   I never get tired of reading posts like this. That is a good day <br/>
letterboxing, and doubly so because it is your first day. Good <br/>
decision not to push for the first box. Way to sneak in for the <br/>
second. Sounds like fun.<br/>
