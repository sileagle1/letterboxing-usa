<div>The orange parrot was sitting in a banana tree in Costa Rica. 
To his great dismay, a man came by to pick bananas and accidentally plucked the 
parrot from his perch and tossed him into a crate of bananas!!  This 
particular shipment was bound for Bradley Airport in Hartford, CT.  When 
the crate was being loaded off the plane it fell to the ground, burst open, and 
the parrot who was very annoyed at this point, flew off in an Easterly 
direction.  As he was looking down he noticed some orange colored disks in 
a strange looking jungle. "This must be the way home" thought the 
parrot.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Interstate 84, to exit 68, turn North onto route 195. Go about 
1/3 mile, take left onto Cider Mill Road. Go past baseball diamond. Go another 
200 yards, turn right into Crandall Park. Park in upper level near tennis 
courts.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Walk between the tennis courts and baseball field.  Turn 
left into the woods, and cross over a wooden footbridge. Walk along pond, stay 
to the left and walk to opposite side of the lodge building. Cross another 
footbridge. At dirt road, turn right walk a few feet on road. Turn left onto 
Yellow trail. (follow yellow paint markers on trees)  At fork stay left on 
Yellow trail at 240degrees.</div>
<div>Stay on the yellow trail. Cross over a stone wall, which will 
continue along the right side of the trail.  On the left you will see a 
bench.  Go a bit further and look for the tree with the orange colored disk 
marker on the right side of the trail.</div>
<div>Bear 300 degrees into the woods, and follow the orange 
disks.</div>
<div>At the top of the incline the trail will turn to the 
Northwest.  At the intersection follow the disks to the 
Northeast.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The pitch levels off, and as you walk down a slight incline, 
you will see a large single boulder sitting to the Northwest.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>                            
The orange parrot was flying along in a frenzy...</div>
<div>                                        
"PIECES OF EIGHT!! PIECES OF LEDGE...</div>
<div>                      
THIS JUNGLE IS SO LEDGEY, IT'S MAKING ME EDGY!!!!!"</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Continue on your Northeasterly course. See more ledge 
outcroppings on your left. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Bear 290 degrees up a slight incline.   Trail will 
then bend to the left at 220 degrees. As the trail bends again you will see a 
large 100-yard-long ledge going along to your right. When you reach the end of 
this ledge, keep following the orange disk trail and take 90 paces.  Now 
look for the hiding place of the orange parrot.</div>
<div>Look left 210 degrees. A small boulder sits lonely at the top 
of a mound. It sits about 35-40 paces away from the trail.  Don't be 
surprised if the parrot yells, "GET ME OUTA' HERE"!!!!!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Retrace your footsteps back to your car.</div>
<div>The orange trail sits on 145 acres recently added to Crandall 
Park. A developer had 42 houses approved, but decided to sell to the town for 
Open Space conservation instead.</div></body></html>
