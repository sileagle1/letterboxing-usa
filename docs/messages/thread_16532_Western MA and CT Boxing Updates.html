<br/>
Over the last week we've been out and about, enjoying<br/>
the fall weather and hunting up a box or two.<br/>
<br/>
Finally got around to the Sunday Drive in CT. We<br/>
picked a perfect day for it, too. Wonderful drive, and<br/>
the final hike up the trail for the last box was<br/>
fantastic! I can't do the views justice, so I'm not<br/>
even going to try to describe it. If you've been, then<br/>
you understand. If not, go see it.<br/>
<br/>
We also went out and visited the Troll King in Forest<br/>
Park. Not only did we find him, but we also found his<br/>
crown, and the promised surprise!<br/>
<br/>
We wound up our day checking on a number of our boxes<br/>
in and around Westfield. We are still eagerly awaiting<br/>
the first person to complete the Zodiac series. Come<br/>
on people, what you waiting for!? :-)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, we've come across quite a few HHs in the last<br/>
month. We left some of them scattered in our wake. The<br/>
question is, where? The weather is supposed to be good<br/>
this weekend...<br/>

   Hi Mike!  Do you mean Forest Park in Springfield?? <br/>
    I didn't know there were any boxes there:) <br/>

   Okay Okay!!  I have 11 with only 1 more to go, but have come <br/>
across an unusual situation... I've had to return to the same <br/>
cemetary four times!! Reason being: First time I went.. foolishly <br/>
was in the middle of the night.. okay, no mystery there.. I couldn't <br/>
find it.. Second time...three days later,  I drove around, looking, <br/>
but there were cars and people everywhere as I tried to look as <br/>
nonchalant as possible. (ever been to a CROWDED cemetary??) Decided <br/>
better try again later. Third time, a week later, I'm walking <br/>
through the place in a quadrant search this time, but there is a <br/>
little lady siting in a folding chair in one section. Must have just <br/>
lost a loved one recently. So sad:( I remember she was there last <br/>
time too. SO I search 100% of the OTHER side of the cemetary, so as <br/>
not to disturb her. No Luck... I go back a FOURTH time, another week <br/>
later.. SHE'S STILL THERE!  I search a little closer to her. But I <br/>
still don't want to intrude. NO luck. It has to be near her... but <br/>
I'm afraid to go back a fifth time or I'll be marked as a cemetary <br/>
lurker. I can see her watching me....watching....     Kstar&gt;  &gt; <br/>

The clues came over the letterbox announce list<br/>
Tuesday night. We were in the park Wednesday morning.<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
This park is yet another one of those places that<br/>
we've always meant to plant in, and simply haven't<br/>
yet. Too many parks, not enough people planting in<br/>
them...<br/>
