Bushkill Falls<br/>
Bushkill, Pike Co. PA.<br/>
<br/>
Planted Oct. 28th 2001<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Rt.80 to exit 52 to Rt.209 north, follow signs to left at <br/>
blinker light at Bushkill.<br/>
<br/>
Home: Rt.209 "south" is a crawl all the way to Rt. 80 on weekends!! So, head <br/>
south on Rt.209 and at "Fernwood Resort's Golf Course" turn left onto "River <br/>
Road". Stay on River Rd. through Shawnee and to Rt.80<br/>
<br/>
Type: Can be just about anything you want. Short and easy or longer and more <br/>
strenuous.1-3hrs.<br/>
<br/>
Terrain: Walkways or not,it comes in flat,with roots and rocks, and with <br/>
stairs to ascend and decend. Who ever built the wood bridges and such did a <br/>
great job!! Very beautiful!!!<br/>
<br/>
"Bridesmaid's" #10<br/>
<br/>
"Happy for her best friends bliss<br/>
Her own tears fall because she missed,<br/>
Her turn at love not yet to be<br/>
This water flows for her and thee...."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Under the sign, on the tree, it marks this spot for you and me. Here  the <br/>
bridge, the first cross beam, tucked under the boards above the stream.<br/>
CAREFUL!!!Lots of folks around, carefull in finding or "you'll" be found...<br/>
<br/>
Be the first to stamp in Nov. 2001 or you will have to wait till April 1st <br/>
2002 for a chance.<br/>
<br/>
This is a beautiful spot worth the price of admission, $8.- for adults, $2.- <br/>
for childern, April 1ST through October.&gt;&gt;&gt;OPEN NOVEMBER<weather <br="">
PERMITTING&gt;(like, no ice or snow) TILL THANKSGIVING!!!<br/>
<br/>
Dogs on leashes were seen.<br/>
<br/>
Do not go during a drought if you want to see waterfalls...<br/>
