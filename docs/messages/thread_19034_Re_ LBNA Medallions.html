I have no personally ordered the medallions However, I know several people<br/>
that have and have received them without any problems what-so-ever.  Perhaps<br/>
you should contact the person off list and ask them about your order<br/>
specifically before presenting it to the list as though the majority of<br/>
buyers are not receiving their products. I am sure it is just some sort of<br/>
mistake or miscommunication.<br/>

I did not in any way read an implication or claim that the majority <br/>

I ordered the first time though an got them --well worth it IMO&gt;  Was James<br/>
Dillon doing the ordering again?  IF so, did he have to have them made again<br/>
or was he selling off extras?<br/>
<br/>
I am sure there is a reasonable explanation and that you will  not mind the<br/>
wait once you get the medallions.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the<br/>
quality!<br/>
