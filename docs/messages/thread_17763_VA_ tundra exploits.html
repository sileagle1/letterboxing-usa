                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!  Just got back from attempting a handful of letterboxes around <br/>
the tundra fields of Accotincture Baye adjacent the Fortress of Good <br/>
Viewing, Fairefax Cty.  The following letterboxes were alive &amp; well <br/>
as of 8 Feb 04:<br/>
<br/>
Aya Fern<br/>
Danaus plexippus<br/>
Honesty<br/>
ADL's LB placed by Squirrel in Oct 2000!!!<br/>
<br/>
We also attempted the Rally LB with no success.  Didn't even try to <br/>
look for Sir Mooseness since we'd already heard from multiple hunters <br/>
that the moose is definitely loose.<br/>
<br/>
Also found a busy bumblebee in one of the letterboxes and it reminds <br/>
me alot of myself--Hoopoe's Busy as a Bee HH!  What a delight in that <br/>
we'd known about this letterbox since its inception but it took a <br/>
year and a half and traveling across the entire continent to actually <br/>
come across it!!!  Wow!!!<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&gt;&lt;  &lt;&gt;&lt;   &lt;&gt;&lt;   &lt;&gt;&lt;   &lt;&gt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
For anybody who plans on visiting these boxes while conditions still <br/>
remain akin to the frozen fields of Alaska, plan on bringing <br/>
snowshoes, crampons, ice skates, fishing waders, and a swimsuit.  <br/>
You'll find plenty of opportunities to use all of these wonderful <br/>
tools during your visit!  As parts of the area resemble a devastation <br/>
zone (I presume thanks to the recent hurricane), be prepared to blaze <br/>
a new trail along the way as the previously marked trail IS no <br/>
longer.  If your plastic bottle/sports ball collection has run low, <br/>
bring spare bags to collect your fill along the way--it looks like <br/>
some sort of plastic recycling center spilled its contents along the <br/>
banks of the region.  We found a handful of perfectly good softballs <br/>
and basketballs during the trek.  Of course, they won't all fit in <br/>
our suitcase so we left some as treasures for future finders.  I <br/>
think they'd need an entire barge to collect all the bits remaining <br/>
along the shore there.  As for wildlife during our visit--we saw many <br/>
different birds &amp; fish throughout our visit.  Lots of animal prints <br/>
in the snow, too.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, the clues were awesome, the hike exceptional and the <br/>
stamps impressive!  Thanks Jolly G Man and Squirrel for an afternoon <br/>
that we won't soon forget.<br/>
