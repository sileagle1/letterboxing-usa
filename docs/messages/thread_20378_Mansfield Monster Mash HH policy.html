Yes, I will in the future include this request in the HH log book.  <br/>
It just never occurred to me to do this in the past as I was under <br/>
the assumption that by nature HH were intended to move from one <br/>
letterbox to another and was not aware that HH were passed around in <br/>
this way at gatherings.<br/>

I will have to agree with Spring Chick. I just recently released 5 hitch hikers in the Mansfield/Norwich area. I would prefer if you find them that they are not brought to the MMM to be put on the table. I do not want the logbooks filled with stamps of people just finding them on a table and stamping in at will. So please, if you have or find one of my HH, and are planning on attending any gathering, either plant it before you go, keep it in your bag or leave it at home. If I see any of my HH's there, I will remove them from the table and replant them myself. Thanks!<br/>

We are The Columbian Bugs and if anyone has any of our HH's please <br/>
feel free to bring them to the gathering to stamp in. We would love <br/>
to have as many wonderful letterboxers to share in our HH's.<br/>
