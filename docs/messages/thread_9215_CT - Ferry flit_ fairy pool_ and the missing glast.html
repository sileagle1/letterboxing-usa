I'm hoping to go back and finish finding all the Glastonbury boxes <br/>
next week, and was hoping for some info from recent finders.  I read <br/>
in a post somewhere that either picnic boulder or sunshine daydream <br/>
was among the missing, but I can't find the post or the responses to <br/>

Thanks for any tips or info.  <br/>
