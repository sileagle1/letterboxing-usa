&gt;---Congrats to your 1 year anniv. and esp. the romantic proposal.<br/>
&gt;That is one count that you should always include (in my book of made<br/>
&gt;up rules) when you posts your counts. After all it did happen while<br/>
&gt;letterboxing! :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I wanted to say a quick word of appreciation for everyone who has<br/>
&gt;made letterboxing such a wonderful addition to my life.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Today is my (and my husband's) 1-year anniversary of letterboxing.<br/>
&gt;The first boxes we found were planted by Two Grey Squirrels in<br/>
&gt;Greenbelt Park, Maryland - Thanks Squirrel!  You got us hooked :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My introduction was by a friend who saw an article on letterboxing<br/>
&gt;and thought that it was something that I might enjoy.  She was<br/>
&gt;right! - Thanks Gigi.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks to the webmasters for all of their hard work and also to<br/>
&gt;every one of you who participates on this list, because even during<br/>
&gt;the winter I have enjoyed reading about your adventures and am always<br/>
&gt;excited to hear about all the new boxes that are out there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; After 1 year, I am at  F53 P3 HH1 PP1.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; (The PP is for Proposal - the Hare faked an email that looked like<br/>
&gt;a post to this list with a letterbox near our home.  We went out to<br/>
&gt;look for it together and while I was eagerly opening the rubbermaid<br/>
&gt;box he went down to one knee.  What a great guy, and a very romantic<br/>
&gt;proposal.  We were married earlier this year.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Keep those adventures coming :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
