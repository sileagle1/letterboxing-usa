Trish points out, and I regrettably confirm, that Hammonassett Beach <br/>
SP won't be open for camping until the weekend AFTER our Gathering. <br/>
I've busted my brains, mistreated the map, and pestered my pals but <br/>
still haven't come up with an alternate. I'm bummed, since the <br/>
campfire letterboxing stories are one of my favorite parts of the <br/>
Gathering experience.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have an idea?<br/>

<div>You could offer the Drew Clan yard and private bathrooms... I imagine that you could earn a little money, too, at $20 per tent.</div>

Although the campgrounds mentioned are not exactly close to the <br/>
Giant, at least it is an option for people.  If I lived closer I <br/>
would be happy to offer my 2 acre rural yard to people to camp (hey <br/>
there are lots of letterboxes near my house if you want to stay <br/>
here!) <br/>

Please, please don't cancel.<br/>

I just moved into a new place last Saturday! (woooo-hooo)  Anyone who <br/>
is commuting a long distance is more than welcome to stay over in my <br/>
new pad.  I have a large living room ... a good sized computer <br/>
room ... and my bedroom.  If anyone wants to take me up on the offer <br/>
drop me an email.  Free lodging is always nice!  (and I have a hot <br/>
shower!)<br/>
<br/>
Keep on Letterboxin' - Letterboxer2002 (Alan)<br/>
<br/>
p.s. - no-one said anything about cancelling the gathering ... just <br/>
that we wouldn't be able to camp out the night before.  Something I <br/>
was really looking forward to.<br/>
