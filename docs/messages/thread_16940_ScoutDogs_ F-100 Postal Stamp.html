<br/>
     Sue and I received Chris' F-100 Postal Stamp this week. As <br/>
usual with her stamps, it is wonderful. In a previous post, Chris <br/>
encouraged mini-gatherings to get this stamp - even those who have <br/>
not yet reached 100 but would like to exchange anyway. If you have <br/>
hit the 100 mark, she asks that you also list what box that was.<br/>
<br/>
     Here's our plan - last minute as it is: we plan on doing the <br/>
Gillette Castle letterbox in East Haddam and wondered if other <br/>
letterboxers would like to meet us in the parking lot this Sunday, <br/>
11/23 at 11:30am. Our time is limited on Sunday but we wanted to save <br/>
some letterboxers postage as many CT boxers are on the mailing list <br/>
and it would be good to see many of our friends all in one place. The <br/>
next name on the mailing list, with mailing label already in place, <br/>
is Mike S of MA. <br/>
<br/>
     You are also welcome to do the Gillette boxes with us. Hope to <br/>
see many of our 100 Finders there on Sunday at 11:30!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
<br/>
