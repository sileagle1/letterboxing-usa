Richmond, VA, that went MIA very shortly after release. Please amend <br/>
the clues as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Box #3: The Amusement Park<br/>
<br/>
THIS IS A MICRO BOX HIDDEN UNDERWATER. YOU WILL NEED A MICRO STAMP TO <br/>
STAMP INTO ITS LOGBOOK. IT DOES NOT CONTAIN A PENCIL.<br/>
<br/>
Get back on the trail and take the left fork. Watch your step over the <br/>
tree roots that cross the trail beside a steep drop-off. Go to your <br/>
right onto the paved path down the hill. Go to your left onto the <br/>
paved walkway that you were on briefly after you stamped into Box #1. <br/>
<br/>
Walk straight through the stone gazebo out its back arch. Begin <br/>
walking toward the bench and the lamp post at the back of the pond. <br/>
You will see a tree on your right before you get to the back of the <br/>
pond. The box is floating in the pond behind the tree. Look for the <br/>
orange string going down into the pond. It is attached to a hook stuck <br/>
in the ground beside the pond. Pull the jar out of the pond with the <br/>
string and stamp in. Reassemble everything and lower the jar back into <br/>
the pond. <br/>
<br/>
This box commemorates that Forest Hill Park was an amusement park in <br/>
the early 1900s.<br/>
