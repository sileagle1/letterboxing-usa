<br/>
I am saddened to announce the death of Towncrier74 of northern Virginia  this past Monday.  His daughter Joy has decided to honor her father by maintaining  his three boxes.<br/>
Considering that she and her siblings have many obligations at this time, I am asking you to be particularly helpful when visiting these boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Condolence messages may be posted to the talk list and when Joy has more time, she will happily read them, do not expect a response immediately.  I am confident that the letterboxing community will respond with kindness and perhaps an anecdote or two.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Susan<br/>

What terrible news it was to learn of Towncrier74's recent passing!  <br/>
He was such a nice gentleman and I am very grateful that we were <br/>
fortunate enough to meet him at the 2004 VA/MD/DC Winter <br/>
Icebreaker.  His passion and enthusiasm for letterboxing was quite <br/>
evident.  I will always remember a little anecdote from that <br/>
gathering--Towncrier74 knew that we had traveled across the country <br/>
for the event and he insisted that we take one of his newly unveiled <br/>
Swim the Ocean hitchhiker letterboxes back home with us to release <br/>
on the West Coast.  I remember how he 'sneakily' handed it off to <br/>
me, sort of like a schoolkid passing a note in class and insisted <br/>
that I release it when we returned home. I saw that hitchhiker again <br/>
at a letterboxing gathering in Portland, Oregon and it made me <br/>
chuckle remembering about the way Towncrier74 launched it! We also <br/>
exchanged some emails since then about one of our boxes we planted <br/>
in Virginia.  He was so kind and caring in that he helped take care <br/>
of our very orphaned letterbox.  He even returned to check on it for <br/>
me after he initially found it.  A true gentleman in my book!  I'm <br/>
so thankful that letterboxing allowed us to cross paths with <br/>
Towncrier74!  The world has lost one more beacon of light!!!  :(<br/>

     Very sad news indeed. The Princess and I had the great pleasure<br/>
of meeting Towncrier at The Pentagon Winter Meet. Quiet, unassuming<br/>
and a true gentleman. We are honored to have his stamp image.<br/>
     Blessings to the family.<br/>

This afternoon I went out to do some maintenance on my Las Vegas Boneyard Box and had <br/>
a HH in my possession from my recent trip to Baltimore.  Lo and behold, it was <br/>
Towncrier74's HH "Ride the Wind."  I was very moved when I realized he had touched many <br/>
lives here on the list and has now passed on.  I also like the sentiments he left behind in <br/>
titling his hitchhikers "Swim the Ocean", "Ride the Wind"  I don't know what else.  I left a <br/>
tribute to him in the HH I left behind.  The whole thing leaves me a little choked up <br/>
knowing how this little activity ties us together and shares often the best parts of <br/>
ourselves with one another.  It is, you might say, a blessing...an inky blessing but a <br/>
blessing all the same.<br/>
<br/>
Belated thanks, by the way, to Team J &amp;R for showing me around Maryland last week, <br/>
thanks for the mud and all the great boxing (and the cootie).<br/>
