<br/>
*hehe* Well, I know of one box that 'sort of' fits this description.<br/>
It's a box in honor of a gerbil, although the owner of the gerbil<br/>
probably doesn't know about the box honoring it. They happened to<br/>
stick it right next to a letterbox in a cemetery, and quite a few<br/>
people looking for the box were surprised when they found a dead<br/>
gerbil instead. So then there was the Dead Gerbil gathering, may he<br/>
rest in peace, and a box dedicated in its honor.<br/>

I second the  suggestion to make a couple copies of the stamp, or be sure to<br/>
save the image so  all is not lost if the box goes missing.<br/>

to    deceased pets.They are not uncommon in CT. I<br/>
planted one in memory of a dog I had and planted it in<br/>

the stamp itself is special to you so I would make a<br/>
duplicate stamp and place the duplicate in the box.<br/>
