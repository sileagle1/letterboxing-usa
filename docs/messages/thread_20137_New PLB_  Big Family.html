Well, it's probably no surprise, as FamilyMan, that I like to see big<br/>
families. My first effort at a PLB will be dedicated to that rare<br/>
breed, the family with 4 or more kids. (Although, having 7 children,<br/>
I think 4 kids is kind of a small family...8-D)<br/>
<br/>
If you have 4 or more children, please feel free to sign up for this<br/>
one. They don't all have to live at home with you (my oldest is off<br/>
at college), just belong to you!<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, the honor system is in order here--no one is asking for<br/>
pictures or birth certificates. Maybe a family picture in the<br/>
logbook? Open to ideas there.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think? I wonder if we'll hit 20 folks?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Yep, been there.  This offer has worked it's way<br/>
through some of the smaller groups, and is now offered<br/>
to the big list.<br/>

Appreciate the note,<br/>

Sorry, just the human variety.  On the PLB list, there<br/>
was such a demand for the pet variety, that 2 PLB's<br/>
were spawned.<br/>
