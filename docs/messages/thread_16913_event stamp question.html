It's not just event boxes. Hitchhikers are openly displayed. I myself have been <br/>
somewhat guilty of hoarding a hiker to bring for just such an occasion.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Then there's ARose's cool Event Stamp Box which has an impression of<br/>
&gt; all the event stamps from each gathering it has visited. It makes<br/>
&gt; sense to me that these would be shared at a gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Just as event themed stamps are made just for that purpose and have their <br/>
own distinct log books associated with... I agree on that - and most event <br/>
stamps have been counted as "event" in their own category. right??<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Do people actually count these as Found boxes?<br/>
<br/>
No from my personal experience. I personally consider them only "event" <br/>
stamps that are special and in their own right  quote: "found" only at such <br/>
places. How many other people have tagged them as an "E"? <br/>
<br/>
In all honesty, the designation means far less than the merit of the stamp and <br/>
wondrous box and logs that are usually specially crafted. In principle, I agree <br/>
that they are somewhat "easy" to find and perhaps should be placed on site in <br/>
consideration only for that day such as part of a series - or perhaps one must <br/>
ask a question and the box is procured upon a correct response??<br/>

<br/>
For me, the thrill of letterboxing is two-fold:  the hunt and the stamp<br/>
collecting  I enjoy exploring new areas and finding the boxes, particularly<br/>
with clever clues.  My kids and I are discovereing a whole new world and<br/>
getting regular exercise as well.  I suspect creatign clever placements will<br/>
be equally enticing.<br/>
<br/>
I also am fascinated with the intricate hand carved stamps--esp. as I have<br/>
finally begun to carve myself and realize the skill invovled in some of<br/>
them.Heck, in all of them!<br/>
<br/>
So, I count as found only those boxes that I find.  The f coount is not a<br/>
huge thing for me, tho hitting that 100 was pretty nifty.  I do not count<br/>
snail mail boxes, tho I do count hitch hikers.  I only count boxes, not<br/>
stamps.  I do not keep count of anything else just yet, tho I will count<br/>
placements as they occur, and may count exchanges,  I haven't really<br/>
decided.<br/>
<br/>
I keep my stamps in a journal with pictures and stories.  I have a seperate<br/>
album for events and exchanges.  I did indeed stamp into a multitude of<br/>
boxes at the gathering  and would do so again--the stamps were fantastic and<br/>
I like having them in my collection.  I do not count them as finds but don't<br/>
really care if someone else does.  Heck, this is not a competitive sport!<br/>
I enjoy these stamps just as I would enjoy other works of art, because that<br/>
is what they are and I am grateful to those who share their talents.<br/>
<br/>
I say, let people count and stamp as they choose--in the end, all that<br/>
matters is the enjoyment YOU derive from letterboxing--not what anybody else<br/>
is counting.<br/>

Funhog, you're my hero! Thanks for echoing my sentiments. <br/>
<br/>
I always prefer an honest "find" rather than a "gimme." Personally, <br/>
while I have no interest in the counting aspect of letterboxing, <br/>
finding any HH out on the trail is indeed an unexpected surprise and <br/>
a joy as opposed to finding one piled on a table with others at a <br/>
gathering.  I don't really see the point. I generally just ignore <br/>
most of those now, though I own there are times, if the stamp is <br/>
extraordinary, I take an image of it. I'd still rather find any type <br/>
of letterbox fair and square. This being said, as with all things <br/>
letterboxing, to each his or her own, eh?<br/>
<br/>
Special and historical event stamps that I don't have already, IMHO, <br/>
are different and I do always stamp them in my logbook.  <br/>

My only problem with a bunch of boxes on a table is that it can be confusing and things get lost or taken by mistake, especially when space is limited and things get strewn about and buried.  I don't like the idea of someone's box disappearing, and I think one or two may have walked off once.  Unless someone is around to answer questions and keep an eye on things, it's easy to see how this can happen.  It's nice to have the opportunity to view and stamp all that's available at a gathering if you can find the time.  I've always appreciated the generosity of others in all that they do and share at gatherings around here.  Whether I partake of what's available or count it in any way is entirely up to me.  Isn't that the way it should be?<br/>

  Subject: RE: [LbNA] event stamp question<br/>
<br/>
  For me, the thrill of letterboxing is two-fold:  the hunt and the stamp collecting  I enjoy exploring new areas and finding the boxes, particularly with clever clues.  My kids and I are discovering a whole new world and getting regular exercise as well.  I suspect creating clever placements will be equally enticing.<br/>
<br/>
  I also am fascinated with the intricate hand carved stamps--esp. as I have finally begun to carve myself and realize the skill invovled in some of them. Heck, in all of them!<br/>
<br/>
  So, I count as found only those boxes that I find.  The f count is not a huge thing for me, tho hitting that 100 was pretty nifty.  I do not count snail mail boxes, tho I do count hitch hikers.  I only count boxes, not stamps.  I do not keep count of anything else just yet, tho I will count placements as they occur, and may count exchanges,  I haven't really decided.<br/>
<br/>
  I keep my stamps in a journal with pictures and stories.  I have a separate album for events and exchanges.  I did indeed stamp into a multitude of boxes at the gathering  and would do so again--the stamps were fantastic and I like having them in my collection.  <br/>
  I do not count them as finds but don't really care if someone else does.  Heck, this is not a competitive sport!<br/>
  I enjoy these stamps just as I would enjoy other works of art, because that is what they are and I am grateful to those who share their talents.<br/>
<br/>
  I say, let people count and stamp as they choose--in the end, all that matters is the enjoyment YOU derive from letterboxing--not what anybody else is counting.<br/>

&gt; them.  If I don't, I won't.  I do count them as 'finds' in my F count <br/>

letterboxing and would otherwise not see these stamps (a reason I like the<br/>
postal boxes too).<br/>
The great thing about letterboxing is that there are no rules (supposedly).<br/>
If you want to impose rules upon yourself, or impose 'what you like or don't<br/>
like' on others, then that is between you and them. But I hope I never miss<br/>
an opportunity to see a stamp or log book at an event simply because someone<br/>
else doesn't want to see them. They always have the option to pass them up<br/>
without interfering with my enjoyment. "Stamp and let Stamp!" is what I say.<br/>
