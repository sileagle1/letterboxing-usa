                    <div class="plaintext-content">Alright, I guess this would be a dissenting vote. I am both a geocacher and<br/>
letterboxer, but there is a big difference in the two. I would much rather<br/>
letterbox, as geocaching seems almost like cheating. I do it because of the<br/>
lack of boxes within reach. I have come across too many missing or flooded<br/>
letterboxes to think that increased traffic from those that can't or won't<br/>
follow letterbox clues would help the matter. Keep them separate. I don't<br/>
have any gripe with planting caches near letterboxes, say within a half mile<br/>
or so, but I don't want people to be able to cross reference and/or publish<br/>
Lat/Lon coordinates for letterboxes. Let them be hard to find! That's the<br/>
fun...finding a box not found for a year or so, intact, dry, and hard won. I<br/>
have a friend that went back three times attempting to find the same<br/>
letterbox and was thrilled to finally succeed. How awful  it would be to<br/>
have the temptation or ability to look it up on the geocaching site and<br/>
simply walk to it, head down looking at a readout, instead of at the natural<br/>
beauty of the area. There's room for both sports, but they're different.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] geocachers<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I recently received an email from a geocacher who had signed into a<br/>
&gt; letterbox I placed this summer. He asked if I minded if he mentioned<br/>
&gt; the box on the geocache website. Has anyone out there had an experience<br/>
&gt; that would indicate that this is a bad/good idea? Funhog<br/>
