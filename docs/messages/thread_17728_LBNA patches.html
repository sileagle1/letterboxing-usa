There is no bulk order requirement for the LBNA patches right now (the LBNA <br/>
site is in need of a few updates and corrections). Here is the link with <br/>
updated info:<br/>
http://hometown.aol.com/mohmers/myhomepage/business.html<br/>
<br/>
A group order was made a month or so ago for the hiking medallions -- <br/>
contact Jim Dillon at n0kwa @ bellsouth.net  (remove the spaces). He said <br/>
that he has a few extras from the bulk order.<br/>
