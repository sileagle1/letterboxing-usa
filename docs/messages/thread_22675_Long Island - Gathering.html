                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
Thanks to Stellabaker123 who responded as being from Long Island.  I<br/>
haven't heard from anyone else.  I have started a list of area boxers,<br/>
but will need you to send me your email address as the post didn't<br/>
include it.  Fivepucks2@aol.com<br/>
<br/>
I thought up a nice location and will speak to the owners when I have<br/>
a chance. I'm thinking next spring and I have the theme which will<br/>
match nicely with the location.  So there is plenty of time to try and<br/>
contact other boxers from around here and anyone else who may be<br/>
interested. Anyone?  Please email me directly so I can add you to the<br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
CT Boxers:  Location will be aprox. 20 minutes from the Pt. Jefferson<br/>
Ferry Dock.  This ferry runs between Bridgeport and Pt. Jeff.  A lot<br/>
of boxes have been placed in Ridge - about 20 minutes- 1/2 hour from<br/>
the ferry going in a different direction.  Could make a nice day trip.<br/>

House Tour  on Saturdays at 1pm on the  northside of the park.  There are row <br/>
boats to rent there too from Memorial Day till Labor Day and there is camping too.<br/>
.  <br/>
There's a box at Avlon in Stony Brook but he lives in Boston &amp; comes to visit <br/>
family &amp; friends  in Stony Brook.<br/>

You could try to contact LI boxers by "contact the placer"  from the site.<br/>
