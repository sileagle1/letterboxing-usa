clues are here: <br/>

<br/>
Pinebrook Park<br/>
Location: Stroudsburg, PA (Monroe County)<br/>
Placed by: Silent Doug and Golden Eagle<br/>
Date Placed: June 15, 2002<br/>
Terrain: Easy<br/>
Difficulty: Easy<br/>
Time: 20 minutes<br/>
<br/>
Pinebrook Park is located along Broadhead Creek in Stroud Township, on <br/>
Route 191 north of Stroudsburg, just south of the intersection of Routes <br/>
191 and 447. The park is open daily from dawn till dusk, and pets are <br/>
allowed on leash (poop scoop laws are in effect). Park in the South parking <br/>
lot.<br/>
<br/>
A field of dreams?<br/>
The grass is always greener on the other side.<br/>
Hop the fence (or use the gate)<br/>
and set your sights on powerful twins.<br/>
Put some energy in your step and hike to meet the pair.<br/>
But don't stop to say hello,<br/>
it's only now you can see your goal:<br/>
Follow its directions, and across a bridge you'll traipse,<br/>
to find a gravelly path (soon turned to grass).<br/>
<br/>
Straight ahead a dead end lurks.<br/>
Better to bridge the turning point<br/>
(or turn the bridging point, or point the bridging turn --<br/>
you'll figure it out with no delay.)<br/>
Listen! Hear the nearby creek's raging rapids roar?<br/>
And the "Clomp, clomp, clomp" of footsteps on wooden planks?<br/>
Better by far than the "squish, squish" of mud-laden boots in this marshy <br/>
mess!<br/>
<br/>
The trail sprouts offshoots to the right every so often.<br/>
Ignore these unless you're seeking a fisherperson instead of a letterbox.<br/>
Continue to the field where picnickers frolic,<br/>
and hold to the right when the path begins to vanish.<br/>
Soon enough the ruts will appear again to show you the way<br/>
once again into the woods.<br/>
<br/>
The trail divides, but it's the trail marker you seek.<br/>
(Be sure to look over your shoulder as to not miss this landmark.<br/>
 From the sign, walk 15 steps on the now-familiar Brodhead Creek Trail<br/>
(a bearing of about 70 degrees).<br/>
Turn left on a grassy trail, and proceed 27 paces to the next junction.<br/>
Take neither, and look to your right to the natural archway marking a <br/>
narrow pathway.<br/>
Duck, and enter this secret grove.<br/>
Past two young oaks and two leaning trees you'll amble,<br/>
Until you spy a stout, healthy, middle-aged oak on your right.<br/>
A rock cairn at its base holds your prize.<br/>
<br/>
Return to the trail marker, and take neither marked trail,<br/>
But rather veer to the left, and return to where you began.<br/>
