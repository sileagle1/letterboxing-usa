spiral bound 'book' of lined 3x5 cards from Wal-Mart as my log book. I just<br/>
flipped it over to use the unlined sides of the cards to stamp on :-) I can<br/>
use the lined (back) of the cards for notes too. I'm on my third 'book' for<br/>
finds/exchanges and have a separate 'book' for stamps I've carved.<br/>
I'm thinking that most people probably have log books at least 3"x5" in<br/>
size. I'm interested in hearing what others think though.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Stamp sizes<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yet another question from the newbie!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was wondering about the size of log books that letterboxers use for<br/>
their personal books (i.e. the book that you keep and stamp in all the boxes<br/>
you find).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The reason I am wondering is that I was thinking about stamps of items<br/>
that are really long (like a ship) or really tall (like a building or tree).<br/>
Is there a recommended limit on the size of a stamp?  I wouldn't want to<br/>
make a stamp that wouldn't fit in someone's book.<br/>

I'd say make stamps any size you desire--but if they're abnormally <br/>
large, I'd warn them in the clue to make sure they bring something <br/>
large enough to stamp into!  =)<br/>

Might I ask... what sizes most peoples stamps?  We've only been to one box, so far.... We are headed to Bear Mountain Tuesday YEAH!... but I created our stamps and compared to some of those we saw in the Vanderbilt box, ours were a little on the large size.  It is hard to tell from the stamps in the files section, but is 2x3 to big?<br/>
<br/>
Also... I was thinking about uploading our stamps, what section should they go in?<br/>

<br/>
Stamp size is strictly a matter of personal preference.  I have seen <br/>
signature stamps from the tiniest 1/2" square to nearly 3"x5".  Same <br/>
for box stamps, with the largest I have encountered being the Cape <br/>
May Zoo box in NJ, which was close to 3"x5".  A 2"x3" stamp is <br/>
probably on the larger side, but certainly not too large.  The <br/>
primary consideration is the size of the log books you will be <br/>
stamping into.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the "average-sized" boxes I have been to, use a log book <br/>
that ranges from 3" square to about 3"x5".  In this case, your 2"x3" <br/>
stamp would not have a problem, but it would more than likely be too <br/>
large for a full stamp in a microbox log.  What a lot of folks do in <br/>
that case is just stamp one portion of their stamp, i.e. the <br/>
lettering or a significant part of the image, etc.  Others carry a <br/>
smaller, alternate signature stamp for the smaller log books.  You <br/>
can also write your comments on the back of the page if your stamp <br/>
fills the entire front side.<br/>

IMHO<br/>
<br/>
stamps should be of a size that can be stamped into a 3" X 5" spirol style<br/>
memo book and still have room to write something at one end of a single<br/>
page.<br/>
