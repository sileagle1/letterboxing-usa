<br/>
I am trying to locate Sue____@yahoo.com.  You recently placed (last<br/>
year) a letterbox on the Heritage Hide trail at Pleasant Grove in<br/>
Palmyra.  I went to this website/posting as I thought it was the one<br/>
listed to get more info, but I couldn't locate your box or trail name. <br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to let you know that we (hubby, myself, 2 kids and 2 dogs)<br/>
located the box on the trail the other day while we were geocaching. <br/>
Wanted to let you know the box was wet inside and didn't know if it<br/>
needed maintenance.  Great location/hide!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this e-mail gets to you.<br/>
<br/>
D<br/>
