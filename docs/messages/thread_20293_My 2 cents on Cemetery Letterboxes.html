forever.  For me this was the whole idea behind planting my cemetery <br/>
box (Catch a Falling Star).  I feel the idea behind the gravestones <br/>
is to memorialize a person so they can in some way live on forever.  <br/>
If no one shares the beauty of these stones with their precious names <br/>
and dates, won't these monuments to our loved ones be for nothing?  <br/>
<br/>
Share the opportunity provided you by a person's loved ones to feel <br/>
the peaceful solitude of the cemetery. Try to feel the memories long <br/>
since forgotten. Respect them, cherish them, and bring others there <br/>
to share in what you felt. <br/>
<br/>

Enjoy life,<br/>
