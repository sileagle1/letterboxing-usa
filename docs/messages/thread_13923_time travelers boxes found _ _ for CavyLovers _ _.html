Congratulations Rustypuff !! We are glad you hit the milestone on one <br/>
of our bonus boxs . E=MC2 isn't meant to be an easy box and our <br/>
intention was that people would have to return for it after gathering <br/>
the needed info . Only one has found it so far and he figured it out <br/>
by trial and error with the map ( I noticed that CavyLovers have <br/>
recently made the trip for the info , so they might also have <br/>
visited . CavyLovers ? ) . You must admit the Blue Hills are well <br/>
worth a return visit especialy now that that two new boxes are in <br/>
place . <br/>

I confess we're very inefficient letterboxes. Especially<br/>
when it <br/>
comes to local parks like the Blue Hills  then we are often one<br/>
box <br/>
a day people! We don't do them in order, either. [Good thing<br/>
there <br/>
are no rules ]<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we have had the clues for E=MC2 for awhile.  We had fun doing <br/>
our homework so we could interpret the clues! Now that we've been <br/>
nudged, maybe we'll try for it this week.<br/>
<br/>
We do love the Blue Hills and are lucky to have it close by! Last <br/>
Sunday we stopped in to do a hike before going out to brunch. We <br/>
FINALLY found the Hancock Hills letterbox, thanks to a hint from <br/>
another boxer. Even then, we did check out a couple of extra<br/>
"Lefts" <br/>
to be sure we didn't miss it.  But what a sweet find!<br/>
<br/>
Of the Time Travelers series, we have found so far Weena, Fiendish <br/>
Things, Back to the Lab and Mr. Peabody, but not necessarily in that <br/>
order.  We plan to meander back to the rest and other new boxes <br/>
placed in the Hills recently.  <br/>
<br/>
Is there a prize for taking the longest to get to 100 boxes? We are <br/>
contenders!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>

P.S.  We hear someone is developing a GTPS (Global Tupperware <br/>
Positioning System) which will locate all Tupperware containers <br/>
within a 10 acre radius. Look for it in your local stores soon!<br/>

We usually only find one a day also. My 9 year old is all gung ho to go, go, go but my 4 year old isn't a big fan of letterboxing yet! (I think it's just a little too much walking for him!) <br/>
