having the opportunity to meet so many DC-area folks at Firefly's <br/>
celebration, we had our busiest weekend yet.<br/>
<br/>
On Saturday, we found the Canadian in DC and Hal and the Magic <br/>
Mushroom.  Unforunately, the second was completely waterlogged, so we <br/>
took it home for a makeover.  We also found Egypt, but failed at <br/>
finding Orion.<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday, we hit the Loonerism Betterspox, along with (finally!) <br/>
finding Get Outta My Stump.  Then we headed in the opposite direction <br/>
to re-place Hal's new box, and trekked along to find Kid Gloves 2 and <br/>
3.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, 7 boxes found, including 1 box rescue, and only 1 failure.  <br/>
Barring some productive placements, I think there are only 3 left in <br/>
DC that we have yet to find.  Now we just have to get to work on <br/>
placing the ones that we've got in the works.<br/>
