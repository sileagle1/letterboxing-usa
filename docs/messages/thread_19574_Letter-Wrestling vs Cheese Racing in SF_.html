Seeings how Ms JugglerMouse and I are planning on coming up north to <br/>
the San Francisco Bay area on July 31st, not that there really is <br/>
much to do there but we hear there is a great disc golf course there <br/>
(JM and I are Frisbeterians - we believe when you die your soul gets <br/>
caught up on the roof and no one can get it down). <br/>
<br/>
Anywho, we was wondering if there was going to be any charcoal a-<br/>
smoking and smoldering and if JM should bring some slices of cheese <br/>
food product with her. You all know my stance on cheese racing and <br/>
how it is an abomination. Nevertheless, my JugglerMouse is feeling <br/>
feisty. 'spect she even might want to take on that Double-Sag gal <br/>
head to head. Sagittarians are a double sign, half horse and half <br/>
human. Geminis are like Elvis, whose mother used to tell him, "You <br/>
were a twin but your twin died."  Personally, I think it would be a <br/>
fine tussle. Whatcha say? Three Quatloos on the Mouse!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I shall be the quiet and reserved badger that I always am.<br/>
