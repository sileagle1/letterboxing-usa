<p>Hearts Abound Series (Part two)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By Team PuppyLover</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Location: Michigan</p>
<p>County: Oakland</p>
<p>Difficulty: Terrain is hilly and location of boxes is a 
challenge.</p>
<p>Starting point: Ortonville Recreation Area</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Directions: Take M-15 North to Oakwood road then turn right. Follow 
Oakwood to Sands Road and turn left. Take Sands Road to State Park Road and turn 
right. Follow this until you see the sign for the park entrance on the left 
side. Take this road all the way to the fork, and then go left until it ends. 
Park here.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Clues: </p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Continue on from Part one: Press on on your current path, up the hill and 
on to the top.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>When the crest youve reached, follow the path of loveremembering love 
is always right. Continue on past the fallen Romeo, past the single lonely 
boulder whose heart is hardened by love lost.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Look over the hill and gaze out into the grassy meadow, taking time to 
remember your own loves and those lost. Then take the path less traveled, 
searching for your devotion at some 340 degrees.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>To your right you will search for a devoted old pine with his mate at his 
right hand. Once his heart was broken in two, but now he has settled with time 
and shares his days with his love. If you look at him you will see how love has 
lifted his sprits and hopefully yours too.</p>
