                    <div class="plaintext-content">The secrecy of letterboxing definitely intrigues me.  I got into <br/>
letterboxing when I googled for information on hiking in Eaton Canyon <br/>
(Altadena, CA) and stumbled upon a letterboxing site listing the <br/>
Eaton Canyon Letterbox.  I read the clues and realized I'd hiked past <br/>
this hiding spot a number of times.  To me, the idea that there was a <br/>
secret to find hidden within a few feet of where I'd been blindly <br/>
walking was just too much of a thrill.  That was in February '03, and <br/>
I'm now at P5 F48.  Bob-Baloo, please plant some more Los Angeles <br/>
area letterboxes and I'll do the same!<br/>
