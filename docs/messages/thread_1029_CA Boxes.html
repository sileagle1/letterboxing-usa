                    <div class="plaintext-content">We took a Spring Break trip from Vancouver,WA to Disneyland.  I had <br/>
asked for a few easy boxes to find and we were successful.  If you <br/>
want to find a few easy boxes off of the freeway check out: Tip Of <br/>
Shasta, W B Ide Adobe and The Source of Sacramento River boxes along <br/>
I-5 in California.  They were all alive and very well.  The Ide <br/>
Adobe box is hidden in a wonderful historic park.  It is just <br/>
beautiful there.  I would of never stopped there if I had not been <br/>
letterboxing.  As was the park where the Source of Sacramento is <br/>
hidden.  I wish we would of taken our lunch there.  Beautiful places <br/>
to experience while we do this wonderful hobby. My husband is a non- <br/>
letterboxer so far, but he was quite impressed with these 3 finds.  <br/>
I will get him out there sooner or later.  We talked about his trail <br/>
name and I have an idea how to carve his stamp.  He will have it in <br/>
his blood by the time summer is through. Willow and family.<br/>
