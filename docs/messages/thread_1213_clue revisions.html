I've only found 1 - and it doesn't look like like I'm going to find <br/>
24!<br/>

&gt; Oh, but Tom, as you know better than most, since I think you've found <br/>
&gt; the most Mapsurfer Letterboxes of anyone, that's the point! To quote <br/>
&gt; Randy's personal website, "Clues can be as simple as a trail run, but <br/>
&gt; I tend to enjoy, and provide, downright cryptic treasure hunts, for <br/>
&gt; the most part. You can play the game at whatever level you enjoy, but <br/>
&gt; for the most interesting physical and mental challenges, try the <br/>
&gt; treasure hunting side of it."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now 24, that's an interesting number.....<br/>

Well I finally got out for only the second time this season<br/>
and managed to bag a couple of virgin boxes, and put a cuckoo<br/>
clue out for this one, so perhaps there's another way to get<br/>
to it ...<br/>
