Jerry's Art-O-Rama in West Hartford has Speedball supplies AND Mastercarve in 3 sizes! (Be still my heart).  JoAnn ETC. Also has 1 size of Mastercarve, and a set of carvers (not Speedball, but looks similar).  Not bad considering there's always a coupon running.  Michael's has sheets of Speedy-Cut and lots of Exacto's.  Again... coupon!  Hope this helps.  MayEve<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was chasing down some of the "pink stuff" to make<br/>
some new stamps at our local AC Moore over the<br/>
weekend.  After searching with two store employees, we<br/>
spoke with the manager, who said that they aren't<br/>
carrying the "linoleum supplies" (apparently that's<br/>
what they classify the Speedball materials as)<br/>
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if that's just our local store, or all AC<br/>
Moores in general, but it may be worth checking out<br/>
and saving yourself a trip if they don't carry it.<br/>
<br/>
But at least there was a happy ending ... I hopped in<br/>
my car and drove down the street to Michaels where<br/>
they still had some  :)<br/>
