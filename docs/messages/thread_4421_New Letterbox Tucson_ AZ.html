                    <div class="plaintext-content">On February 9, 2002 Funhog placed the Flycatcher Letterbox at Aqua Caliente<br/>
Park in Tucson, Pima County, AZ. This former 101 acre ranch is a true<br/>
oasis, complete with palm trees and limpid pools. You will have to bring<br/>
your own dates and sweetmeats to complete the picture. As you stroll the<br/>
shady paths, you may catch a glimpse of a brilliant little red bird, the<br/>
Vermillion Flycatcher, darting about in the mesquite trees.<br/>
To the trailhead: From I-10 head east on Speedway Blvd. to Houghton. Turn<br/>
left and go to Tanque Verde. Turn right and go to Soldier Trail. Make a<br/>
left and go to Roger Rd. where you turn right. The park entrance is just<br/>
ahead on the left. The trail begins at the northwest corner of the parking<br/>
lot.<br/>
To the letterbox: As you approach one of the ponds, you will see a single,<br/>
tall palm on the opposite bank. There are Saguaros standing at 310 and 330<br/>
degrees magnetic. As you walk off the path to a point midway between these<br/>
two sentinels, you will see a Prickly Pear cactus. Five steps beyond this<br/>
cactus, the letterbox awaits at the base of a mesquite tree.<br/>
