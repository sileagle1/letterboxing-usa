Planted by rtrw on October 11 ,2002<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty - depends.  If there's a lot of mud there, just skip it.  <br/>
Planting was a mucky nightmare.  When we used to come and the river <br/>
hadn't overflowed its banks it was lovely.<br/>
Time - See above.  5 minutes if the area is dry.  <br/>
Directions to starting place - Between Sterling and Lyons on K-14 and <br/>
K-96 is Avenue S.  Drive approximately 2.5 miles from the north side <br/>
of Sterling Kansas to Avenue S.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Details you should know - This used to be used a lot by school<br/>
groups, but it looks like it's been pretty well forgotten.  I crossed <br/>
the bridge and it was fine.  <br/>
<br/>
Details you don't need to know - This box is dedicated to KAB and <br/>
SLBS, my dear friends and bouncing partners.  You will know why when <br/>
you get there.  At the far side of the bridge is a fallen tree that <br/>
made me think of every creepy Brothers Grimm tale I'd ever read.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues:		<br/>
Turn east onto  Avenue S.  Go 5.3 miles to your next turn.  <br/>
Soon after you pass a farm pond turn right From the turn go .4 miles <br/>
to the forest entrance<br/>
As you drive in it looks like you are heading into someone's door <br/>
yard, but you aren't.<br/>
Pass the interesting square barn on your left.<br/>
Black bear forest is soon after on your right.  You could easily<br/>
drive right by, so keep you eyes open.<br/>
The Black Bear Forest sign is there, but it is leaning against a tree.<br/>
Walk through the rough hewn entry doorframe to the area.<br/>
Head toward the bridge.  <br/>
Cross the bridge. <br/>
