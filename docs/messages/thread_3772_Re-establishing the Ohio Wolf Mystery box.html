stolen.  The clues looked so great, and it was a shame that the box <br/>
had been tampered with.  <br/>
<br/>
With humble appology to lonemasswolf, I re-established a temporary <br/>
box at the end of his trail of clues.  I am sure the stamp is not <br/>
nearly a nice as the one originally there, but at least there is <br/>
something now, so that one can find the end and make an impression.  <br/>
