                    <html><body>RTRW and I were out early today and found a bunch of boxes in Hartford County Ct.  All in good shape along the Olde Newgate Prison trail.<br/>
Ape Escape was found at the end of that trail and is on his way to a new home next weekend.<br/>
We had trouble with Oak Leaf in East Granby.  Has anyone else found it difficult?  We'll head back another day.<br/>
Happy hunting!
