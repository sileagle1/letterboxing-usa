miles of driving over the past 7 days. I am very happy to be back <br/>
home!<br/>
<br/>
I drove through seven different states, and was able to find a <br/>
letterbox (only one) in three of them. I also placed my first <br/>
hitchhiker stamp/journal in one of the three.<br/>
<br/>
I like this concept a lot. I'll try to get a page up on which we <br/>
can list the different hitchhiking boxes out there, and maybe track <br/>
their voyages as well.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the name of this hitchhiker is 'The Firebolt.'<br/>
