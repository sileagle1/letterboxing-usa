<br/>
no rules Tammy.... do your best!  I also have trouble with the letters &amp;<br/>
have yet to be pleased at my attempts.  I usually sit here swearing<br/>
quietly as I muck through another one.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  When you are writing clues, where do you start the clues?<br/>
<br/>
Clues are very individualized with this group.  Again, we all have our<br/>
own style.  The Bethany Lake series that Mitch &amp; have been doing started<br/>
with some pretty easy street directions to get people in the<br/>
neighborhood.  It has since morphed into a series of rhymed clues.  My<br/>
first box, Brown's Camp, is so far out in the boonies that it starts<br/>
with GPS coordinates &amp; very little in the way of tough clues... I figure<br/>
if someone makes the attempt to find it, they should be rewarded.  Let<br/>
your concience be your guide.  We will applaud your efforts whatever<br/>
they may be!!<br/>

I've seen stamps w/ just a date, a year, or you don't need to have any letters if you don't want to.  It's your creation!!<br/>

No, its just a general view of mine in answer to the question about<br/>
whether to give directions to the start.  To answer Tammy's question,<br/>
there are no rules, do what seems the most fun, or what appeals to you<br/>
artistically, etc.  I think most people tend to give directions to<br/>
the start (in USA Letterboxing), so it is not a rule, but a custom.<br/>
I guess I was just saying that I generally do not do that, to make <br/>
the point that there are no rules :-)<br/>

As my neighbor Thom suggests, our only rule is that there are no rules.  Just<br/>
a personal suggestion, I think its kewl to at least put the year you placed it<br/>
on the stamp.  Just a picture is fine, though.<br/>

I have been interested to follow the discussions regarding logos for LUSA.<br/>
How are you going to choose, they are all great.<br/>

To many people the world over, not least America, what epitomises the US in<br/>

Good pt about the clues though.  It was fun trying to figure out where your MD<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I am puzzling over that, too. I was thinking of trying that one when I<br/>
go to visit my son in Annapolis next. But how the H*** do I know where "the<br/>

the scene????<br/>
HELP!!!!<br/>

&gt; So, if I want to hide the box in Lost Lake Park for example (I'm<br/>
&gt;  making up names here) should I say "Enter Lost Lake Park in the<br/>
&gt;  city of XYZ, NC at the main gate on Easy Street" or should I<br/>
&gt;  maybe say "From the Bell Tower at XYZ University, go 3 miles east,<br/>
&gt;  1 mile south, 20 paces north and enter this public area."<br/>
<br/>
This is a matter of personal choice.  Such decisions may affect the number of<br/>
visitors your box has, or even the age group it appeals to, but we are all<br/>
doing things a little differently.  As for myself, I'm going to try to take a<br/>
variety of approaches, with some boxes being very explicit in defining the<br/>
precise starting point, and others being more cryptic, or requiring some map<br/>
study prior to beginning the hunt.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Maps....do I need to make a map?  Or are written clues alone OK?<br/>
<br/>
This is also entirely up to you.  Many of the clues on the site include maps,<br/>
but this is not neccessary.  As long as you feel you have defined the location<br/>
of the box to your liking, a map may not be required.  Several of my letterbox<br/>
clues do not include maps.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Another question:  After I get the letterbox all done, would it be<br/>
&gt;  a good idea to put the whole deal in a ziplock bag to help keep<br/>
&gt;  moisture out? (I know it would be a rubbermaid box I'd be using<br/>
&gt;  and they are supposed to be pretty airtight but...)<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend this.  All of my letterboxes have the logbook enclosed in a<br/>
ziplock bag, which is then placed in the rubbermaid box.  This helps protect<br/>
from not only leaky boxes, but from perfectly ordinary condensation caused by<br/>
temperature variations.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A couple of comments here:<br/>
Check out the "Getting Started" part of the web page - I've pretty much<br/>
settled on the Rubbermade container - white cover variety. Dan sent me<br/>
one of his round tube-types, which also looks good, altho a bit small to<br/>
my thinking. I'll give it a try, tho.<br/>
<br/>
Check them out the Rubbermade's individually before purchase - put the<br/>
cover on and squeeze - if any air is getting out, moisture will get in -<br/>
even just humidity and air pressure changes. Second, put everything in<br/>
zip-lock bags inside - especially any paper products. <br/>
<br/>
As for the orphan question, stick in a small pile of pre-addressed<br/>
postcards (to you) with the letterbox stamp already on. With luck,<br/>
visitors will stamp(their stamp)and mail them back - it becomes a way to<br/>
guage the traffic, and is also neat mail-art stuff.<br/>
<br/>
As for how to start writing a clue, etc: Here is how I've done it.(6<br/>
times now).<br/>
1) Decide on the letterbox name, related to some place, feature,<br/>
whatever you choose.<br/>
2) Make the stamp, get the box and contents ready, then,<br/>
<br/>
3)Go for a walk in the vicinity and hunt about for a good place to hide<br/>
it. It doesn't have to be exactly at the location of the "subject" -<br/>
every place is different - hunt about a bit until you find a place to<br/>
your liking. Avoid a place where a casual find (i.e., accidental, not<br/>
letterboxer) is likely. Under or between rocks is pretty good if<br/>
available. I look for permanent (rocks as opposed to fallen trees, etc)<br/>
as it may be a while before I get back to them.<br/>
<br/>
4) Once the box is hidden, work backwards to some logical starting point<br/>
- landmark, feature, whatever, something easily described to get the<br/>
start right. Paces, compass bearings, follow trails, 30 paces towards<br/>
Kalamazoo (assuming you are  not actually in Michigan), use literary<br/>
references (see Tom Cooch's WONDERFUL clues in Randolph/Braintree, VT),<br/>
whatever seems to work for the place, and for your own individual sense<br/>
of homor. Have fun with the clue.  There are scads of ways to<br/>
communicate the sequence to the prize - Mitch's rebus (rebi = plural?)<br/>
soulnd like a great approach! <br/>

<br/>
Well, here's my comment on the ziplock thing. <br/>
As a beader, many of my beads were/are stored<br/>
in various containers, separated by ziplock bags.<br/>
I've found they decompose quite quickly, and it seems <br/>
to not matter much if they're in light or dark. Don't<br/>
count on a ziplock bag to keep the contents of<br/>
your box safe and dry... at least not for long. If<br/>
you use them I suggest getting the thickest "ply"<br/>
(freezer bags?) and changing them out very <br/>
regularly.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I've noticed that the rubbermaid containers<br/>
that I have don't seal airtight. They look like they<br/>
could use a rubber gasket or something slipped up<br/>
into the lid. Has anyone tried that? I think if I<br/>
could design the ideal container, it would be a<br/>
rubbermaid type box with a hinged lid that sealed<br/>
airtight - with a gasket, and had a snap-latch to<br/>
hold it fast. I have dozens of this type of container<br/>
that I also store beads in, however they have <br/>
tiny compartments (they're originally designed<br/>
for fishing fly storage) and don't seal airtight. If I <br/>
could find them without compartments, I could <br/>
probably attach my own gaskets in the lid. I'd love<br/>
to see how that works. Has anyone ever tried<br/>
an adhesive on rubbermaid? What works? Is it<br/>
vinyl?<br/>
<br/>
I actually like the idea of screw-top containers,<br/>
but the round shape seems like an inefficient use<br/>
of space to me. The rubbermaid sandwich box holds<br/>
everything very compactly, but the drawback is it's <br/>
not airtight.<br/>
<br/>
Just rambling.<br/>
