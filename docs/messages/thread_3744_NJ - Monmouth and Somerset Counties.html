<br/>
I need help! I plan to do the Monster Cereal Series, Toe Path, and <br/>
Rutgers Gardens boxes around Thanksgiving.<br/>
<br/>
1) Has the "Toe Path" box been replaced? It was reported <br/>
missing/flooded in July. Anyone know its status?<br/>
<br/>
2) I cannot print out Kim Mako's "Rutgers Gardens" and "Monster <br/>
Cereal" clues. Has anyone had the same problem? I think there may be <br/>
a coding/HTML problem or maybe its that damn Geocities banner on the <br/>
webpage, but I've tried everything I can think of. Webmasters, could <br/>
you check on this problem for me? (I think it's the page and not <br/>
me...)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help you can give.<br/>
<br/>

The "Toe" Path box is once again in business--I had to dry out the stamp and <br/>
pages, and I added new pages to the book. But, all is now in order.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
