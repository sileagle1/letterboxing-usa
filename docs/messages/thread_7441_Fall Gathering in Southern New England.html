     Sorry, I can't make it.  Sounds like this year's festival is <br/>
shaping up to be a carnival beyond compare.  Although I can't be <br/>
there in person, I'll be sure to cook up a good sideshow for you... <br/>
and maybe a batch of pumpkin cookies, too.<br/>

Hmmm, I actually figured this out previous to yesterday's posting, <br/>
Tom, but aren't you referring to one of Julius Caesar's Roman <br/>
standards set in 46 BC, not Julian's invention?  (See I own a real <br/>
dictionary.  OK, well maybe I don't actually own one but I do have <br/>
one on my desk at work).<br/>
