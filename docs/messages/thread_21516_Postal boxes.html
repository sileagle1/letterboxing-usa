&gt; Hey, I'm new to letterboxing, along with my family, and I was <br/>
&gt; wondering if we could get some postal boxes. If so, that'd be <br/>
&gt; awesome. Guessing you'd need our address- <br/>
XXXXXXXXXXXX<br/>

Hi Celtic Quinn,<br/>
On the left hand side of this page or near the bottom of the LBNA <br/>
home page there is a listing for "Links". If you scroll down the <br/>
various links you will find Silent Doug's site. After you go to <br/>
Doug's site you can find his links listing on the left of his page, <br/>
and when you go there you will find two areas that are concerned <br/>
with postal letterboxes. After you check out those sites you might <br/>
want to check out a listing under his "Hot Topics" that covers <br/>
letterboxing safety/security. If you notice I deleted your address <br/>
from my response to you. Posting addresses on chat lists is not a <br/>
good idea. This list is open to the general public and can be <br/>
googled. Since you are new to letterboxing you might want to check <br/>
out http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers<br/>
Atlas Quest also has a board for postal letterboxes.<br/>

Welcome to the group! Yes! Yes! Yes!Please remove your address! You <br/>
never know who is out there! You can remove your address by going <br/>
back to your posts and clicking delete message on the upper right <br/>
side of the page. Once you see an open box to sign up for at the <br/>
group below, you should email only the creator of the box with your <br/>
snail mail address and what other info they ask you for. Often, you <br/>
will have to agree to terms as well, like using delivery <br/>
confirmation, only holding the box x amount of days before <br/>
resending, including a story in the box, ect. The link for the PLB <br/>
group is here:<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/postal_letterboxing/<br/>
<br/>
I would read over their FAQ. It gives you some info on postal <br/>
letterboxing. You really need to be involved with this group if you <br/>
want to be part of this. This is the place to sign up for PLBs.<br/>

I wouldn't say that.<br/>

I would say - "Publish your address at your own risk, because some <br/>

address for things you hadn't intended."<br/>
