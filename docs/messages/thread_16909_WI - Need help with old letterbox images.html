                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I was just getting ready to adopt all of the yet to be adopted WI<br/>
letterboxes when I discover today that they have all been removed from the<br/>
website!  Have no fear!  I will still adopt, replace, fix, etc all of them<br/>
as time allows.<br/>
<br/>
I could use some help from other letterboxers though.  Some of the lost<br/>
letterboxes have been gone for quite a while (before I was a letterboxer).<br/>
I would like to replace them with a stamp that is as close to the original<br/>
as I can get, so if you have any of the stamps listed below, I would<br/>
appreciate receiving a scanned image of it so I can re-create the stamp(s).<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for images of the following WI stamps:<br/>
<br/>
Aztalan SP LB<br/>
River Watch LB<br/>
Madison - Majestic Theater<br/>
Madison Tribute Series (2)<br/>
East River Trail Series (8)<br/>
Sturgeon Bay Shipping Canal EAST SIDE and bonus stamp<br/>
Cabot Point Lighthouse LB<br/>
<br/>
(I should also note that some of the letterboxes removed from the site are<br/>
still alive and well.  I'll adopt/repost the clues when I get out a verify<br/>
their status.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
Thanks, Dragon, for adopting these letterboxes. Of the 7100 <br/>
letterboxes on the LbNA website, there are still about 150 that have <br/>
not been claimed by their owners. If anyone is interested in seeing <br/>
a list of them organized by state, go to letterboxing.org and click <br/>
on Search For Boxes. Pull down the Placer list and click on <br/>
Unclaimed, and you'll see the lonley orphans. We've been culling <br/>
through them assigning them to their owners (you'd be surprised how <br/>
many people have signed up for a letterboxing account but have not <br/>
claimed their own boxes yet), but it's a big job. Anyone who wants <br/>
to adopt an unclaimed box can write us here at the big list or <br/>
directly at webmasters at letterboxing dot org.<br/>
