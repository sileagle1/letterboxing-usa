Leesylvania State Park (htttp://www.state.va.us/~dcr) takes its name from the Lee family plantation, which was built on the site of the park more than 240 years ago. The plantation house, which now stands in ruin, was home to Henry Lee II and his wife Lucy Grymes Lee. Eight Lee children were born and raised here, including General Robert E. Lee's father, Revolutionary War hero Henry "Light Horse Harry" lee. The park also contains the remains of a Civil War Confederate artillery battery, constructed at the orders of Robert E. Lee to help keep the Potomac River out of the Union army's hands. The also have a nice information and nature center worth visiting. It you love boating of any kind it is an excellent place to go. Call 703-670-0372 for more information. <br/>
