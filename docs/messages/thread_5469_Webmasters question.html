read. On my computer, the current font combined with the background <br/>
texture and my astigmatic eyes, I have difficulty seeing punctuation <br/>
and some letters. I hate to complain since you guys do such a great <br/>
job. Thanks, Funhog<br/>

It's my pleasure! I do both whatsnew and some of the west (including <br/>
NM), and try pretty hard not to miss any letterboxes on the whatsnew <br/>
page. I'm not quite as organized/compulsive in nature as that chore <br/>
requires, so please don't hesitate to let me know if I missed <br/>
something. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Sorry about that! I re-did them in the more standard format tonight. <br/>
Is that better?<br/>
<br/>
M, the kids, and I love reading your clues!<br/>
