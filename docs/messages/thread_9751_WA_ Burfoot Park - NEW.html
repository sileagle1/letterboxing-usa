<div>These boxes have been in my car for two weeks while I have 
been trying to find the time to get out there and place them.  dvn2r ckr 
snuk in and placed her boxes in MY park :-(</div>

<div>Burfoot Park<br/></div>
<div>Nearest Town: Olympia, WA<br/>Nearest Community: Boston 
Harbor, just up the road and well worth visiting.<br/>County: Thurston<br/>Placed: 
12/20/02<br/>Placed By: Fudrick <br/>Clues: Trivial <br/>Trek: Easy, unless you go 
down to the beach, then some down and back up.<br/>Reminder: a great place for a 
picnic lunch.<br/></div>
<div>Burfoot Park -a Thurston County Park that covers 50-acres 
of property with 1,100 feet of saltwater beach frontage on Budd Inlet.. The 
center of the park is a large grassy area great for family picnics and 
activities. There are three covered shelters available in Burfoot Park. Enjoy 
the beach on Budd Bay that features beautiful views of the State Capitol and the 
Olympic Mountains (no dogs or fires on beach). The Horizon Trail Nature Loop is 
an Eagle Scout project, providing guide wire and Braille (and written) 
information on the fauna in the woods. Featured foliage highlights include the 
Boston Harbor Garden Club Memorial Garden, the Butterfly Garden, and the 
Rhododendron Trail.<br/></div>
<div>There are a number of signs that say "Caution - Poison Oak 
- Remain On Trail" or "Danger - Poison Oak - Remain On Trail". I have never seen 
poison oak, so don’t know if I saw any or not. <br/></div>
<div>Directions to Burfoot 
Park:<br/>Northbound from I-5 in Olympia, take Exit 105 (City Center, Port 
of Olympia). Stay to the right as you follow the Port of Olympia signs. At the 
end of the ramp, proceed right and go under the freeway. Go left onto Plum 
Street which becomes East Bay Drive, then Boston Harbor Rd. Proceed six miles 
and look for Burfoot County Park on the left.<br/>Southbound from I-5 in Olympia, 
take Exit 105B. Follow signs for Port of Olympia, staying right toward Plum St. 
Follow Plum Street as it becomes East Bay Drive, then Boston Harbor Rd, north 
and proceed six miles. Burfoot County Park is on the left.<br/></div>
<div>Clues To Follow:<br/>Park in one of the 
lots. Find your way to the Restrooms (hint - at the westerly end :-). Looking 
west you will spot the corner of the Forrest Shelter. Cross the roads and head 
down the trail named ‘To Beach’ (a common trail name in this great park). At the 
westerly end of the grassy area the trail continues. At the first Y head left. 
You will see a small bridge, before you get to the bridge, you will spot a tree 
on the left with a squirrel hole. It is more likely a mole hole, as it is at the 
base of the tree. Bur should be hiding here. Please rehide well.<br/>Continue 
across the bridge. You will come to yet another Y, with a directional post. 
Follow the arrow to the Viewpoint, enjoy the view. What is that you spot across 
the valley? Lets find out! Head back to the corner with a post, head the way you 
haven’t been yet. Oh No, you are back at the road. Head to the right, past the 
reader kiosk devoid of scintillating information. You get to a beach trail with 
a large sign that says ‘Beach Trail’. Head down the trail to the beach. You will 
come to yet another Y, follow the sign that says ‘To Beach’. You will come to a 
bench on the left, it is time to sit for a spell and rest up. You will see a 
bird house in a tree off to the left. Hopefully a bird or two will be there to 
watch. You may spot the big tree to your left. Away from the trail there are two 
roots starting on the tree and heading to the beach. Between them should be 
Foot. Please rehide well.<br/>Since you have gone this far, you might as well 
head on down to the beach and enjoy the view. <br/></div>

No problem, looked in on yours while I was there, nice stamps, great<br/>
locations (actually ones I would have chosen :-)<br/>
<br/>
You have gotten WA off to a great start, we all need to help get to the top<br/>
of the list!<br/>
<br/>
So many locations, so little time (at least for some of us)<br/>
