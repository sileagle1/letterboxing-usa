them , now here is the good part. Maybe Shelly knows me from swim <br/>
club, does she swim? Timmy will be at Suffield Academy to swim on <br/>
Sunday I would be happy to meet you there to give them to you. I <br/>
could mail them if that doesn't work.  We have done 2 swim meets at <br/>
the academy I just didn't think of it when we spoke yesterday.  Hope <br/>
to hear from you soon. Carol<br/>
