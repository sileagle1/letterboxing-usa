Hey Ryan, we have at least half a dozen boxes that are placed on<br/>
various islands in the Michigan archepeligo. Most of them are<br/>
accessable via a ferry boat, but some of them you can only reach via<br/>
private watercraft. <br/>
<br/>
I wasn't in PDX long enough last spring to find any of your boxes, but<br/>
you're welcome to come to Michigan and hunt any of these up. (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; I'd love to hide a box that required getting over (or through!) a<br/>
body of water to acquire!  Especially if the water is perfect for<br/>
snorkling in.  Seems criminal NOT to hike a box in such a location<br/>
when you can!  <br/>
&gt; Sheeze, first planted boxes on people's roofs without permission, and<br/>
&gt; now not planting them that requires a swim or a boat to get to. <br/>
&gt; *shaking head*  Where will the disappointments end?! <br/>

Isn't this a fun twist on a harder to find LB?  I planted one this <br/>
summer that is down the Middle Fork of the Salmon River-an absolutely <br/>
amazing, week-long, whitewater trip.  You can't get in there by car, <br/>
and very few (like maybe Ryan :) would attempt to hike it.  I don't <br/>
anticipate that many will find it, but I hope someone will someday.  <br/>
There is a lot of wonderful history and so many beautiful spots (and <br/>
some fun rafting, camping, and soaking in hot springs) along the <br/>
way.  I knew it may be a lonely box for a long time, but it was still <br/>
worth hiding and will be a rare find for someone since hardly any <br/>
will be able to say they took a week-long trip on a boat to get an LB!<br/>
