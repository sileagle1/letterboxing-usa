views of the Connecticut River Valley.  When you get to the summit you can <br/>
wave south across the valley towards the two boxes placed by the Drew Clan <br/>
on the Holyoke Range!<br/>
<br/>
Tom, I will Email you the scan of the stamp (which actually relates <br/>
thematically to the box location--a first for me, hehe).<br/>

<br/>
Terrain:  Easy, with some gentle climbs and muddy trails.  Blazes on trails <br/>
are infrequent and often faded.<br/>
Clue Difficulty:  Easy<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  From Route 116 just west of the Sunderland bridge, turn onto <br/>
River Road in Deerfield and drive 1.5 miles to Hillside Road.  Turn left <br/>
onto Hillside and drive .3 miles to a gate and small parking area on the <br/>
left.<br/>
<br/>
Walk through the gate and follow the trail, which climbs gradually uphill <br/>
into the woods.  This trail is marked with only a few red blazes.  Stay on <br/>
it until you come to a brook where there are quite a few downed hemlocks.  <br/>
Stop for a moment and note some landmarks, as you will come back to this <br/>
spot on your way out of the woods.  Look for a trail on your left marked by <br/>
a hemlock bearing a yellow blaze and a triangular blue trail marker.  Bear <br/>
left, crossing the brook, and enter this trail, which is marked with yellow <br/>
blazes.  Now hike uphill, staying on the yellow-blazed trail as it meanders <br/>
through the woods.  Keep going until you reach an intersection with a <br/>
blue-blazed trail, which will be on your left.<br/>
<br/>
Bear left onto the blue-blazed trail,  This is a wide, well-used section of <br/>
trail that runs gently uphill.  It will take you to the summit of North <br/>
Sugarloaf.  Youll come to an old tree stump in a small clearing.  There's a <br/>
footpath on the right, which leads, in just a few steps, to a large boulder <br/>
and the overlook.  Facing southwest, take in the views of the beautiful <br/>
Connecticut River Valley.  Now, look to your left for a narrow footpath.  <br/>
Follow it a very short distance to two more boulders. Youll find the North <br/>
Mount Sugarloaf letterbox underneath the lower of these two boulders.  If <br/>
there are other, non-letterboxing hikers nearby, please be discreet when <br/>
removing and replacing the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
To return to your car:  Return to the blue-blazed trail and retrace your <br/>
steps to the junction with the yellow trail.  Stay on the blue trail.  Just <br/>
after you cross a stony brook youll come to a junction with the red-blazed <br/>
trail.  Turn right onto the red trail and follow it downhill.  Portions of <br/>
this trail are quite muddy.  You will end up back at the brook surrounded by <br/>
lots of downed hemlocks and the junction with the yellow-blazed trail.  Keep <br/>
going on the red trail back to your car.<br/>
