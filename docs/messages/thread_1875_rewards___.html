&gt;    Thanks Kay for considering the kids in your denominations. I <br/>
think <br/>
&gt; increments of 25 at the lower end are important. We are trying to <br/>
&gt; encourage participation so a little reward is due.  You will be <br/>
&gt; getting our order soon. Carol<br/>

Your points about kids is well taken.  Having two young letterboxers <br/>
myself, I agree.  BUT, let's not forget about the hunt as a reward <br/>
unto itself.  Particularly if it leads you to a beautiful place you <br/>
had never ventured, or if you're finally coming close to one of the <br/>
more challenging clues.  And, if your search is successful, there is <br/>
also the reward of the stamp :-)<br/>

<br/>
well after being silent all fall and most of the<br/>
winter, I am finally back. My life is getting simpler<br/>
so I can finally go back out and hunt for some of<br/>
those boxes. I found a few the other day so I think my<br/>
total is now 68... I am not sure I have to count<br/>
them.. It would have been higher had I not been<br/>
waylaid by "real life".<br/>
<br/>
Anyways I agree with lone wolf, the reward is the hunt<br/>
itself... the capture of the stamp in your logbook,<br/>
the capture of the memory of the hike.<br/>
<br/>
However as far as stamps go they are fine for the<br/>
edification of ones ego, a nice little way to brag.<br/>
There is a company that already offers "merit badge"<br/>
sized patches with numbers of all denominations, even<br/>
with mylar threads(those metallic looking<br/>
threads:silver, gold, bronze, platinum....), and they<br/>
often run less than 75 cents a piece..... <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for listening....<br/>
