Mansfield area on Monday and found 34 boxes. The BEST part was that DD <br/>
arranged for my 200th box to be "Mother/Daughter."  I Love You Corrina. She <br/>
got me hooked last May 8th and I wanted to try to hit the 200th box before my <br/>
1 year ann., WOOOO HOOOO I made it with time to spare.  I was so excited that <br/>
I carved 6 stamps (1 for each of my grand children) and will be planting them <br/>
next Monday. Thank you everyone for your time &amp; effort in Letterboxing, we <br/>
love you for them. <br/>
