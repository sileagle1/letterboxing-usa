Location: James River Park<br/>
City:  Richmond Virginia<br/>
By: Itchy Butt Girls<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Reedy Creek is part of the James River Park system in Richmond <br/>
Virginia.  The Reedy Creek parking lot is off of Riverside Drive that <br/>
is located south along the James River.  Riverside Drive is <br/>
accessible from the southern end of the Lee Bridge (Belvedere Road).  <br/>
There are signs for Reedy Creek parking on Riverside Drive.<br/>
<br/>
After parking in Reedy Creek parking area, turn and face Riverside <br/>
Drive, walking uphill towards Riverside Drive to a trail off to your <br/>
left.  The trail begins next to a large rock.  This is the Buttermilk <br/>
Trail.  Follow this trail to a creek, staying on the left side of the <br/>
creek, continue on the trail as it goes up few stone steps and then <br/>
over a wooden footbridge.  At the end of the wooden bridge, take the <br/>
left trail, and follow this a short distance until you come to a <br/>
Richmond Sewer manhole.  At the manhole, turn left, and follow this <br/>
trail to the creek and a number of box culverts (tunnels).  Cross the <br/>
creek and take one of the tunnels to the left of the creek.  At the <br/>
end of the tunnel, stay left, and follow a gravel trail to a dam.  At <br/>
the dam, go left up a few steps, and then notice a memorial on your <br/>
right.  With you back to the memorial, look for a tree with three <br/>
trunks.  A few paces roughly south-west behind this tree with three <br/>
trunks, and underneath some rocks, you will find the Reedy Creek <br/>
Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
The carving represents one of the primary uses of Reedy Creek, which <br/>
is access to the river for white-water kayaking.  As this area may be <br/>
heavily used, please be careful when retrieving and returning the box.<br/>
<br/>
Have Fun!<br/>
