<br/>
Trail names are funny. I wonder if a lot of us chose our trail names "in the<br/>
moment"? When we found out about letterboxing or right before going out to<br/>
get our first letterbox, not knowing how much our trail names were going to<br/>
identify us within this fantastic hobby and community.<br/>
<br/>
I have two kids (4 and 5 at that time). My wife found out about letterboxing<br/>
and wanted stamps for them. I couldn't care less about letterboxing at that<br/>
time, but I agreed to make stamps for their new discovery. Off the cuff I<br/>
asked what they wanted their stamps to be. They were "at-the-moment" images<br/>
and names (Flying Spider and Wave). This is what they were "into" at the<br/>
time. Than I got COMPLETELY addicted to letterboxing and had to have a trail<br/>
name and I was already too involved to sit and think out the trail name<br/>
because we were going AGAIN the next day. So I came up with an<br/>
"at-the-moment" trail name, SAHD, which is an acronym for Stay-at-Home-Dad.<br/>
<br/>
Well the deeper I got into this hobby, I found I needed another trail name<br/>
for our family and that too was "at-the-moment," Team Randalstik, the name<br/>
of our cat.  We still have all our names even though we have matured and I<br/>
still love them! And even if I stop being a SAHD, I am proud to have been<br/>
one and want that "Badge" forever, at least in the letterboxing community.<br/>
<br/>
My point? Could these in-the-moment names be more accurate and succinct at<br/>
describing us than if we thought about it too much? Gut instincts . . . raw<br/>
. . . this is me . . . even if I change. I'm a graphic designer by trade and<br/>
logos are one of the HARDEST things to do and most time consuming because we<br/>
all fuss over them too much. Designers should take a cue from letterboxing<br/>
trail names.<br/>
<br/>
I love people's instinctive, raw, trail names!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, mine's nothing extremely original, and while it seems "obvious" to me,<br/>
I've gotten some funny looks at times.   My trail name is also the name I<br/>
use on my email account and any of the online discussion boards that I'm on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I happen to breed, train and compete with Rottweilers.    We compete in<br/>
agility (you may have seen this on Animal planet when the dogs go over<br/>
jumps, through tunnels, weave poles, etc).   I live in a small town outside<br/>
of Boston and got tired of people saying "Where???"  after I'd told them the<br/>
town's name.  So it was easier to tell people (who lived far away) that I<br/>
live near Boston.    Thus, cleverly, I'm BostonRott.   :-)<br/>
