came up short on both. They are planted at Fort Constitution in New Castle, NH. <br/>
Has anyone found them recently? I'm sure I found the area where they should <br/>
have been...<br/>

I was staying at the Sheraton Harborside this weekend, located on the coast <br/>
in Portsmouth, NH. My husband  who isn't a letterboxer but puts up with me  <br/>
met me in the lobby and reported that a man and a woman had just walked by <br/>
saying, "So, you want to go look for some letterboxes." Argh! I just missed them!<br/>
