"The Y Family", on a family camping and letterboxing trip, decided to <br/>
commemorate the occasion by placing this box in Martin Dies State <br/>
Park.  This park features camping, screen shelters, fishing, <br/>
canoeing, hiking, bird watching, and swimming.  There is a park <br/>
store, playground and showers.  Be prepared to see wildlife on your <br/>
hikes, including woodland warblers, woodpeckers, bluebirds, heron, <br/>
wood ducks, cranes and alligators.  Also, B.A. Steinhagen Reservoir <br/>
is the site of the winter bald eagle census.  So enjoy the park, just <br/>
like Baby Bear, Antman, Clueless Collector, Running Rain, and Silver <br/>
Eagle did!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
The "The Y Family" letterbox is located in Martin Dies State Park, <br/>
west of Jasper.  From Jasper, go west on US 190 for 12 miles. The <br/>
park has 3 units, so turn left into the first unit you reach, on Park <br/>
Road 48, which is the Hen House Ridge Unit.  Get a map at the <br/>
Headquarters, then drive to the "Nature Trail" on your left just <br/>
after crossing Gum Slough.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Park near the information board and begin your hike going South on <br/>
the trail.  In about 200 yards you will come to a fork.  Go right <br/>
(South), toward the lake, for about 20 paces.  Turn left (East), and <br/>
go 8 paces, off the trail to the base of a large tree.  You will find <br/>
the box in the base of this tree, in an open cavity filled with <br/>
leaves and sticks.  Be sure to re-cover the box well!!!<br/>
<br/>
Now continue on to Silver Eagle's box.<br/>
