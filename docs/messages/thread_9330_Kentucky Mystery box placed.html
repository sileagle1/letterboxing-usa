Difficulty: Easy Clues to figure out, Difficult to get to<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the county where the monument to the President of the Confederacy stands<br/>
and the birthplace of the first Poet Laureate of the United States has a<br/>
museum, is a town with a somewhat musical name.  Despite its fast tempo,<br/>
this town only has two roads.  When you arrive at this intersection there<br/>
will be:  On the Northeast corner are some woods, on the southeast corner is<br/>
a cow pasture, on the northwest corner is a house next to a ceramics shop,<br/>
and on the southwest corner is a house next to Jordan's Crossroads Grocery.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take the highway west between the two houses (the ceramics shop and the<br/>
grocery).  Follow this long and winding road 4.3 miles and you will see a<br/>
wide spot in the road and a very tall rock shooting up into the sky.  It is<br/>
best to pass the wide spot and go another 10th of a mile into the parking<br/>
lot and then walk back to the wide spot to climb the steps.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are many ways up the rock and you can choose any, depending on how<br/>
adventurous you are.  You just have to get to the top.  The directions here<br/>
are to go up the stairs, some of which are smoothed out rock and others are<br/>
cement blocks placed there.  These stairs, which are visible from the<br/>
highway, go up about 60 feet. At the top, turn left and keep going up.  This<br/>
is where it gets hard.  There are no steps here but there are some blocks of<br/>
wood placed into the slope for gripping.  For those of you who bring small<br/>
children or dogs, there is a five foot ladder in this section, so they may<br/>
need a boost up.  (Always a pleasure with our 90 pound Lab.)  When you get<br/>
to the top, you can see off to the left the remains of a ranger tower.  This<br/>
is the highest point in three counties and was used for decades as a fire<br/>
watch tower.  I recommend walking around the entire rock and taking in the<br/>
view, but if you are intent on getting to the box read on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At the top of the stairs/climb, turn right and head across the rock.  A dirt<br/>
path develops very quickly.  Follow it heading north and west.  At one point<br/>
you will have to jump down abut a foot and a half to stay on the path.  It<br/>
will begin to curve to the left and open up into a large flat area.  At the<br/>
far end of the flat area is a tree with a big hole in it and a rock painted<br/>
like an alligator.  The tree is perfect for tying off your ropes to rappel<br/>
back down.  Well, I guess you could take the stairs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So now you are at Alligator Rock.  Reach in his mouth.  On the right side<br/>
are two rocks with a gap between them.  The letterbox is behind the forward<br/>
of the two rocks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Warnings:  There is a 90 foot drop about 15 feet from the alligator.  Please<br/>
stay away from the edge.  This area is also ripe for clean up.  Bring an<br/>
extra garbage bag and help haul someone else's mess out.  If you come in the<br/>
summer bring plenty of water.  The humidity is very high here and you can<br/>
dehydrate quickly.<br/>
<br/>
