Does anyone know or is the person that hid the above letterbox on <br/>
this newsgroup?  My husband and I were camping down there this <br/>
weekend and I wanted to look for a place to hide my geocache, and <br/>
they happened to place it right where I was looking.  I signed the <br/>
log book but didn't have my stamp with me, and it looks like I was <br/>
the first to find it.  I didn't jot down the hiders name, and I was <br/>
looking on LBNA for it, but it hasn't been posted yet.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any information on this, please let me know or post.  <br/>
Thanks.<br/>

I tried to reply off list, but your computer apparently won't talk to mine,<br/>
lol<br/>
<br/>
That was one of  the boxes hidden in preparation for the Letterboxing Gather<br/>
held on Saturday at Hocking Hills.  The clues were not posted in order to<br/>
give gather-attendees the first opportunity to find the boxes.  I am not<br/>
sure when the clues will be released publicly, but you can contact<br/>
Trailtracker  through the LbNA site, using  the contact the placer feature.<br/>
