                    <div class="plaintext-content">  Thought I would chip in with my 2 on Poison Ivy Prevention.  What <br/>
better cure than not getting it to begin with!  I used to get poison <br/>
ivy pretty bad at least twice a summer.  Hiking, Geocaching, <br/>
Letterboxing, whatever.  Even knowing what it looked like didn't <br/>
seem to help as a couple days after "not seeing it" I would break <br/>
out.<br/>
    Now,every time before heading out, I put something on called Ivy <br/>
Block.  Website is www.enviroderm.com. I've bought it at CVS.  Smear <br/>
it all over my arms and neck and legs.  Then when returning home, I <br/>
wash off with Tecnu outdoor skin cleanser.  I have yet to had a <br/>
major outbreak.  I've gotten a few blisters here and there but <br/>
that's it. It works great for me.  Christine never seems to get it <br/>
at all. <br/>
