Message: <br/>
Howdy, Some Feedback. My wife and I were up in Wilkes County NC this past<br/>
weekend and went after three boxes. None successful. Some info to ammend to <br/>
the<br/>
appropriate boxes....<br/>
<br/>
Pumphouse - We followed the clues... well done, long trip down hill and quite<br/>
steep in some places. This box was missing. Presumed removed, or pehaps washed<br/>
away in one of the gulley washer storms. We left a note in a plastic baggie<br/>
where we believe the box should have been. Great place to hide one. We would<br/>
have done that if we had one prepared ahead of time. <br/>
<br/>
Waterfall -- when you get to MilePost 233 on the Blueridge Parkway, you see no<br/>
waterfall... go 100 feet further North to the clear overlook and spot the<br/>
waterfall --- probabaly 3 miles away! We believe it to be Beauty Falls or<br/>
Stone Mountain Falls ... a hike to reach it. Did not go. <br/>
<br/>
Schoolhouse -- the clues are quite vague... we asked several folks in the area<br/>
and no one know where the one room school house was. We did find a picture of<br/>
the Stone Mountain School - one roomer - in the visitor's center, but no<br/>
information. We could not find a ranger to ask. We did hike up a logging road<br/>
in the general direction for about a mile with no results. Will check out old<br/>
topo maps to see if there are any buildings showing in that general vicinity. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for continuing to update this site. Lesson learned, go after boxes that<br/>
have an identified owner. .... peace .. abe and gail<br/>
