Maine <br/>
letterboxing territory today to find some great adventures awaiting<br/>
us...<br/>
<br/>
Starting at our south portland checkpoint, we took inventory of our<br/>
"BUG <br/>
LIGHT GLYPH" and "SPRING POINT" boxes while enjoying bagels and <br/>
coffee...and then north towards Freeport. <br/>
<br/>
We found the "MAINE WOLF" box and enjoyed a visit to the "SALTY <br/>
HEMLOCK" box as well.  Looks as though the Osprey is still missing in<br/>
flight. <br/>
I'd be happy to replace that if needed. Please contact me if<br/>
interested...<br/>
<br/>
We were the first visitors to stamp into "FERN FINDER" in Lisbon.<br/>
Great <br/>
handmade log book and an easy find on our drive.  We didn't have as<br/>
much <br/>
luck further along at "COVERED BRIDGE" or "GRAFTON NOTCH" are both <br/>
those boxes missing?????<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the Rumford drive-by, we truly appreciated the drive-by<br/>
experience <br/>
while stamping up in the car!!!  All told, I think we covered a<br/>
couple hundred <br/>
miles driving around these parts, but well worth the trip before we<br/>
move north <br/>
from the southern maine area.<br/>
<br/>
On the way back from Grafton Notch there was a sign alongside the<br/>
road for <br/>
PIES...yes, road pies- and not the roadkill kind - we indulged<br/>
ourselves with <br/>
the purchase of a blueberry pie - the likes of which cannot exist<br/>
outside of the <br/>
state of maine. Phew! that made all the driving worthwhile.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see some folks at the August gathering. Is anyong making a<br/>
stamp for <br/>
the event?  Take care, - Phyto &amp; Isosceles <br/>

ago.  The owner might want to check up on it.<br/>
As for the PIES, I agree that alone makes the excursion worthwhile.  <br/>
Yup, darned good pie...<br/>

Can the webmaster remove them from the web site as they are both <br/>
