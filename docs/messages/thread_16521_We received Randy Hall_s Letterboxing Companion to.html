<br/>
   Sue &amp; I came home to find a special treat at our doorstep, The <br/>
Letterboxer's Companion, by Randy Hall. Those of you who ordered it <br/>
from Amazon.com, as we did, should be receiving yours shortly.<br/>
<br/>
   In an effort to respect those who do not want to hear about the <br/>
book until they receive or purchase their copy, I have posted a mini-<br/>
review of the book on our website.<br/>
<br/>
   Early to mid next week I should be posting my interview with <br/>
Randy. I'll keep you posted when it's up. My questions will be going <br/>
out to him Wednesday evening.<br/>
<br/>
   Have fun &amp; just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
<br/>
