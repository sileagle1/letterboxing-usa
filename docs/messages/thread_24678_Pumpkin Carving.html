I was just looking at your site for the first time in a while.  The Red Sox pumpkin was great.  Except for one thing....the Red Sox stink.  Why couldn't it have been a nice carving of Steinbrenner's Face, or Babe Ruth or Mattingly.  Or how about a huge Yankees symbol?  I don't know why you people all like the Red Sox so much.  That Papelbon kid is a clown....don't you agree?   Steinbrenner would have shot and buried him in centerfield if he had worn a kilt to a Yankees parade.  I mean come on now.<br/>
