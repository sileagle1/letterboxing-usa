quality gum eraser and use an exacto knife to carve into it. Remember <br/>
that when you stamp it, it will be flipped so it is a little tricky to <br/>
put writing on it. I think it is a waste of money to get a kit because <br/>
you can probably do just as well on your ow although it could take a <br/>
few tries to get it right. My first one turned out cooler than I <br/>
thought it would.<br/>

You might do well to search your art supply store rather than any of<br/>
the stamp or hobby shops. They sometimes don't understand what it<br/>
means to actually create a stamp rather than use a commercially made<br/>
one. This is art people art! repeat after me - a r t.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a plethora of links:<br/>
http://www.negia.net/~unity/prod.html<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, I enjoy Speedball's speedy stamp (pink stuff) not the<br/>
speedy cut (crumbly cream colored) and the mastercarve (like butter)<br/>
made by Staedler Mars. Some prefer PZ cut (now in orange!) and others<br/>
swear by erasers. It's all a matter of choice.<br/>
<br/>
If you'd like to branch out, I suggest a visit to your real art supply<br/>
store or perhaps ordering online using one of those resources on the<br/>
CC link. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

The first few decent attempts I made were not on crumbly gum eraser, but the white erasers you can get at Staples or WalMart. Staedtler-Mars makes them, but there may be knock-offs.  That white stuff is the same stuff you get when you buy Master Carve, AFAIK.  My friend managed to find them in a bargain bin in Brooks Drug store once. An exacto knife or a wood carving kit can work, too.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have trouble finding carving material around here, too.  We used to<br/>
be able to get a kit at Michaels', but they seem to have stopped<br/>
carrying it in the store here.  But I have discovered carving<br/>
materials and tools in the local college bookstore, with other art<br/>
supplies.  (I'm a big fan of "the pink stuff" called Speedy Stamp.)  <br/>
<br/>
I also spend a lot of time on the website Atlasquest <br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com   If you look there, you will find a<br/>
tutorials section with a lot of great information about making stamps,<br/>
including descriptions of all the different materials out there. <br/>
There are also discussion boards where people talk about what they<br/>
like to use and why.  And though I've never ordered from her,<br/>
letterboxer Webfoot has a website http://www.stampeaz.com/ where you<br/>
can order all sorts of carving materials and tools, and everyone at AQ<br/>
just raves about it!<br/>

Hope this has been helpful.  Have fun!<br/>

&gt; with age.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any other advice??  BTW, I tried to search the messages and got <br/>
&gt; thousands of hits because "stamp" "making" etc.  I tried to read <br/>
&gt; through them until I just couldn't anymore!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for any help!<br/>
