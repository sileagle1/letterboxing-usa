&gt;We dried them out the best we could but I really think you should consider <br/>
&gt;replacing the boxes with something a bit sturdier (rubbermaidish) the lids <br/>
&gt;are all warped &amp; don't fit on the boxes well.<br/>
<br/>
I picked up one of the Rubbermaid square sandwich-size containers at the <br/>
thrift store a week or so ago, and was a bit surprised to find out when I <br/>
got home that it wasn't as airtight as I expected. When you press the lid, <br/>
it expels air, indicating that the seal isn't very tight. Last weekend, one <br/>
of the boxes in Ithaca that I found (Snoop Doggy) had water inside the box, <br/>
even though the contents were safely bagged and thus dry. It was in the <br/>
same Rubbermaid square sandwich container.<br/>
<br/>
So even these Rubbermaid containers can be troublesome, particularly if <br/>
they're very exposed to the weather. The larger Rubbermaid containers don't <br/>
seem to have the problem -- but you should probably try the "squeeze test" <br/>
on any container you're considering using to house a letterbox. If air <br/>
expels easily, then they're almost certainly not watertight.<br/>
