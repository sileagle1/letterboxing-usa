<br/>
You can delete all the photos in the VA Icebreaker folder if you <br/>
wish and I'll upload them again, smaller.<br/>
<br/>
You also might delete the VA Riverbend folder since you could argue <br/>
that it's now "out of date" with the latest VA gather replacing it.<br/>

mass stamping at various picnic tables from the gathering folders, <br/>
and that freed up lots of space for more pictures. Hopefully nobody <br/>
will miss them. I had a couple of requests from letterboxing dogs to <br/>
remove their pictures, as they were embarrassed having to wear hats <br/>
in shots available on the world wide web, so I deleted them too. arf! <br/>
