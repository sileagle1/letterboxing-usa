Clues:<br/>
Take the Covered Bridge Trail down the hill to where it bends first to<br/>
the right then to the left spying the covered bridge through the trees.<br/>
Stop here for a brief history lesson about the rebuilding of the<br/>
bridge.  When you are finished turn around and proceed through the<br/>
bridgecareful not to step in horse droppings.  With 3 trails to pick<br/>
from take the one that keeps you out in the open.  Pass by a sign to the<br/>
right that welcomes you.  Continue up the paved hill.  At the top, the<br/>
path will bend to the left.  Sit, take a rest, and enjoy the view.  When<br/>
your ready look back over your left shoulder for the trail head of a<br/>
horse path.  Quickly you will reach a junction, proceed on the trail<br/>
that reads 306*.  This path will lead you down under the trees.  Youll<br/>
know youre on the right track if you spot a Safety Zone.  When you<br/>
spy a 3rd Safety Zone", go and stand facing that tree.  Look directly<br/>
behind you for a natural bench, this will be a great place to stamp<br/>
up.  From your perch take a bearing of 296*.  Next Root under this<br/>
leaning tree to find what you are looking for.  Please make sure you<br/>
rehide this box well.<br/>
Retrace your steps back to the Covered Bridge Trail and pass back<br/>
through the covered bridge.  Stay straight and follow the horse trail to<br/>
where you see a large tree growing in the middle of the path.  Proceed<br/>
up a trail to the left of that tree.  At the top of the hill continue on<br/>
the left trail.  Youll see a tree with its root growing across the<br/>
path.  Youll pass by a connecting trail on the right looking for a thin<br/>
tree on the same side with a bulbous growth on it at about 6 feet up.<br/>
