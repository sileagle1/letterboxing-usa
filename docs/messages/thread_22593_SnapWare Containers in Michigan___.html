<br/>
I just saw a big display of SnapWare Snap 'n Lock containers at Bed, <br/>
Bath &amp; Beyond in Novi, Michigan. The size we've been discussing that's <br/>
great for a letterbox runs $2.99 there.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop talking about them now, hahaha!!!  (Hopefully they'll start <br/>
showing up everywhere because they seem to be a very useful item for <br/>
more than just letterboxing!)<br/>

<br/>
I occasionally travel to Korea (dh resides there at the moment) and <br/>
am constantly perusing the stores in and around Seoul for 'ideal' <br/>
letterboxing containers.  On my last two trips to the area, I <br/>
purchased several of these SnapWare containers (among a bunch of <br/>
other containers)--specifically the smallest one they make which is <br/>
about 2"x1.5"x1.5" (prism shape) and after squeezing all of the <br/>
typical letterboxing contents in it for a mini-letterbox, the lid <br/>
didn't always stay snapped down tightly.  This probably isn't a <br/>
problem for the larger containers but rather just that small one <br/>
because the 'snap tabs' don't seem to get enough 'leverage' to lock <br/>
down the contents.  One visitor who doesn't take the time to ensure <br/>
the snaps are down tightly would ruin the contents of the contaier.  <br/>
Otherwise, I like the container.  I did find it a bit bulkier than <br/>
other interesting letterboxing containers I found in Seoul that ran <br/>
about the same dimensions (at least the ones whose 'internal' <br/>
capacity held the same amount of stuff as did this one).  I found <br/>
other containers in Seoul that had just as 'sturdy-sealing' lids as <br/>
this one but whose entire 'size' was about 75% of the SnapWare <br/>
containers' size (i.e. they were much slimmer).  Unfortunately, I <br/>
haven't yet found these slimmer containers available in the US yet.  <br/>
Perhaps they're on their way soon?  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing this info though.  I'll keep my eyes posted for <br/>
other interesting containers on my next trip to Korea and will let <br/>
you know what I learn.<br/>
