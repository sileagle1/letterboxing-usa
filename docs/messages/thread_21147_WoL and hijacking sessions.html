&gt; Just to let everyone know The World of Letterboxing is out there and<br/>
&gt; waiting for you to come and visit<br/>
&gt; click here:<br/>

I didn't want to post about this earlier, but it looks like your<br/>
session ID has expired or you manually logged off of the website, so<br/>
I'll mention it now.  If you're ever on a website that has something<br/>
like sid=72fe3ff2913195064f06ae08f2fc0b3b as part of the URL, sid is<br/>
short for "Session ID".  This is the special number given to you so<br/>
the website knows who you are and can track you from page to page on<br/>
the site.  This is normal and virtually ALL sites have such a thing. <br/>
Usually they're hidden in cookies so you never even see your session<br/>
ID.<br/>
<br/>
However, when it's pasted to a URL like that, people can hijack your<br/>
session!  Session IDs typically expire after about a half hour of<br/>
inactivity.  Consequently, those following the link--if you were<br/>
logged in--would find themselves logged in as you!<br/>
<br/>
Probably not what you wanted to happen.<br/>
<br/>
The moral of the story is--never post a link that has an sid listed as<br/>
part of the URL.  It's a HUGE security risk, and I'm kind of surprised<br/>
Steve even has that option set on in the first place.  But the risk<br/>
only comes about if others can learn your session id.  It's like<br/>
posting your home phone number and address for the world to see.  Most<br/>
people won't abuse it, but you certainly shouldn't be taking chances<br/>
doing so either.<br/>
<br/>
This public service announcement was brought to you by, well...  me. <br/>

<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>

PS. Sorry, folks, but if you were hoping to hijack the session, your<br/>
time has passed.  =)<br/>
