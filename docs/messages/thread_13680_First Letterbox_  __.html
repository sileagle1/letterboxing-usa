I am new to letterboxing...I just wanted to say that we found our <br/>
first and second letterboxes today!!! We are Maya(mommy), Alan(3 and <br/>
1/2 year old), and Catey (5 month old)...we are "DuckiesFamily" on <br/>
letterboxing.org :)<br/>
the frist one we decided to do was Peace on Earth...GREAT one! Easy <br/>
to find, nice place! <br/>
<br/>
the second one was a little harder...it was "Walkup Reservation" it <br/>
was easy to find and easy to get to,  but then it was nice but LONG <br/>
hike back to the van(cause mommy can't read the map right...lol...we <br/>
ended up going around a very long way...ended up being about an hour <br/>
long hike or so)...but it was very satisfying<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to those that placed those!! They were great! <br/>
