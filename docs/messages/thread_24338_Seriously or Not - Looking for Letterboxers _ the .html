<br/>
Never let it be said that I won't jump into a fray......As some here <br/>
know who have read my recent posts (particularly those about the <br/>
recent debate over the MartianMaggot/Rick_in_Boca boxes)- I started <br/>
letterboxing only in the last year.  I am not an "old salt" at the <br/>
letterbox water cooler but then I am far from a green horn newbie (at <br/>
least that's the impression I've made on Rick - who's opinion I <br/>
value, as well as others on the MidAtlantic board). How did I learn <br/>
about letterboxing?  An article in some magazine - I read it a couple <br/>
years back and then lost track of it.  I found it interesting but was <br/>
dealing with too many things at the time to get involved in anything <br/>
new.  Last winter I came across it again and this time read over it <br/>
and decided to investigate.  I looked online, found LBNA &amp; AQ, read <br/>
the FAQ pages (way to many that my eyes hurt) and then proceeded to <br/>
find my first box.  I took to this this like no other hobby that I <br/>
had come across in the past.  As I soon learned, it was to become <br/>
more involved in my life to where I planned to hit boxes based on <br/>
areas I was going to go to for one reason or another (I'm sure that <br/>
sounds familiar to alot of you).  I took the "code" seriously and <br/>
have always hid boxes better than I found them, carried extra <br/>
baggies, paper towels etc.. to try and do minor re-habs to boxes in <br/>
need.  I have e-mailed all placers whose boxes I find (some of course <br/>
who never respond) and above all - I do my best not to get 'muggled' <br/>
while re-hiding.  I recently hung around an extra 30+ minutes until a <br/>
family that stopped to look at some ducks had walked away before re-<br/>
hiding a box. In some cases, I find that the last person to stamp in <br/>
before me was someone who's been around alot longer on LBNA than me - <br/>
but I find the box not sealed as well as could be etc.. So it's not <br/>
just newbies that err at re-hiding a box. And I've gotten rather good <br/>
at finding tough boxes and some-time assumed missing boxes (**Item of <br/>
note - MartianMaggot's "Crabbing Bridge" Box still exists - it was <br/>
water damaged and had not been found since 2004 - So, I was happy <br/>
finding that one last month) Once again, I'm not here to take sides - <br/>
but offer an opinion.  So here goes, I appreciate the view that <br/>
Letterboxing be shared 'one on one' among those with a common <br/>
interest or who would be more likely to maintain the integrity of the <br/>
game.  However, I certainly see the other side of having articles <br/>
that talk about the hobby - so that others who are not surrounded by <br/>
clans of letterboxes in their developments can learn about it also.  <br/>
If there was no article - I may have never learned of it - And I do <br/>
my best to take it as seriously as anyone I've talked to or met from <br/>
LBNA or AQ.  Now, that being said, cheesey fluff articles in news <br/>
mags with incorrect facts or those that 'out' letterbox locations are <br/>
a disgrace - but a well written piece with some general info should <br/>
be welcomed.  I am currently approaching the 100 mark for boxes found <br/>
(Not all listed on AQ cause I'm too cheap to pay the money - but I <br/>
will probably buckle under eventually)and may hit the mark within the <br/>
next month or so (If I get to hit Cyclonics 14 box extravaganza at <br/>
WCSP - that will easily do it and then some).....So what's the point <br/>
here?  (I forgot already..)  Oh yeah, whether you find out from a <br/>
friend or a magazine - the type of person you are will dictate how <br/>
you treat Letterboxing overall.  Case in point: I have a friend who <br/>
is a big outdoors hiker guy who was interested in letterboxing when I <br/>
mentioned it briefly - I took him and his wife on a hunt, upon <br/>
finding the box they were anything but discrete and started posing <br/>
for pictures like they were standing at the North Rim of the Grand <br/>
Canyon.  Although I tried to enlighten them further, they did not <br/>
take it seriously and figured no one would mess with a box that they <br/>
found by mistake.  The really did not understand the concept at all. <br/>
I quickly became annoyed to say the least. The final outcome, I told <br/>
them I will not go letterboxing with them again (they could not <br/>
understand why???) and since I had never told them about the sites <br/>
relating to Letterboxing - they simply moved on to other <br/>
activities.   So, is it better to learn of Letterboxing from a friend <br/>
or from a news article...that depends on the person in <br/>
question ...and as Forrest Gumps' mother told him..."life is like a <br/>
box of chocolates...you never know what you're gonna get".   -John<br/>
---------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
"..Jesse, frankly many of us DON'T want Letterboxing spread around in <br/>
this way, so please don't add another article that <br/>
attracts "infatuation" to the hobby.  The majority of these folks who <br/>
read the articles don't bother to *really* learn about Letterboxing <br/>
before jumping in to go on this exciting-sounding "treasure hunt", <br/>
often jeopardizing our 'boxes.  It is a game of stealth, and they <br/>
usually just don't get that...<br/>
Please reconsider, and if you like the hobby so much, just introduce <br/>
it to a few of your friends who you know will also enjoy and respect <br/>
it.  Word of mouth is the only way Letterboxing should be "spread" in <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Y'know, I don't disagree with you.  I think you're absolutely right <br/>
in that what kind of boxer someone is depends a lot more on what <br/>
kind of person they already are than on how they learn about <br/>
letterboxing.  The problem is, an article can't discriminate.  It <br/>
can't control what kind of person reads it.  And even if it's a well-<br/>
written article that emphasizes stealth and discretion, it can't <br/>
make the person reading it pay attention to those sections of <br/>
itself.  When informing someone else one-on-one about the hobby, you <br/>
can at least judge personally and on an individual basis whether you <br/>
think that person will be a responsible boxer and make sure that <br/>
they understand how to be one.  You have control that an article <br/>
doesn't, as you demonstrated by deciding that your friends weren't <br/>
cut out for boxing after seeing how they acted on their first <br/>
excursion.  I think that's a more accurate explanation of why <br/>
everyone objects than that they just think that people who learn <br/>
about things in magazine/newspaper articles automatically don't <br/>
belong.<br/>
<br/>
As a writer myself, I understand the desire to use writing to share <br/>
something that you love with as many people as possible.  And, if <br/>
someone's going to write an article, better that it be a boxer who <br/>
does understand our concerns than someone who doesn't love what <br/>
they're writing about but is just doing their job.  But over time <br/>
I've come to understand why articles are a thorny issue in the <br/>
letterboxing community, so it's something that I would avoid myself.<br/>

in my local paper. I did not tell about a box and clues and all but <br/>
gave the LBNA website instead. This made me investigate and read the <br/>
FAQ's as well. <br/>
I thank whoever wrote that story in the paper because Im not sure I <br/>
ever would have found this great new hobby of our families. Through <br/>
this we have been places that we didnt know about and that is the <br/>
best part, discovering something new in an area you have lived almost <br/>
your entire life. Then the icing is of course the box itself. <br/>
I will say Im glad the article gave the website not a box and clues <br/>
because I then went to see what this was all about and only those <br/>
really interested will do read the rules and then of course follow <br/>
them. <br/>
Good luck with the article and I hope this helps as someone who <br/>
learned about lb through an article. I did send the author a great <br/>
big thank you, by they way from me and my kids. <br/>

&gt; John...great insight....It IS a matter of the person that finds out <br/>
about the hobby, and not the method they find out...never looked at <br/>
it that way.<br/>

all, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Never let it be said that I won't jump into a fray......As some <br/>
here <br/>
&gt; know who have read my recent posts (particularly those about the <br/>
&gt; recent debate over the MartianMaggot/Rick_in_Boca boxes)- I started <br/>
&gt; letterboxing only in the last year. I am not an "old salt" at the <br/>
&gt; letterbox water cooler but then I am far from a green horn newbie <br/>
(at <br/>
&gt; least that's the impression I've made on Rick - who's opinion I <br/>
&gt; value, as well as others on the MidAtlantic board). How did I learn <br/>
&gt; about letterboxing? An article in some magazine - I read it a <br/>
couple <br/>
&gt; years back and then lost track of it. I found it interesting but <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; dealing with too many things at the time to get involved in <br/>
anything <br/>
&gt; new. Last winter I came across it again and this time read over it <br/>
&gt; and decided to investigate. I looked online, found LBNA &amp; AQ, read <br/>
&gt; the FAQ pages (way to many that my eyes hurt) and then proceeded to <br/>
&gt; find my first box. I took to this this like no other hobby that I <br/>
&gt; had come across in the past. As I soon learned, it was to become <br/>
&gt; more involved in my life to where I planned to hit boxes based on <br/>
&gt; areas I was going to go to for one reason or another (I'm sure that <br/>
&gt; sounds familiar to alot of you). I took the "code" seriously and <br/>
&gt; have always hid boxes better than I found them, carried extra <br/>
&gt; baggies, paper towels etc.. to try and do minor re-habs to boxes in <br/>
&gt; need. I have e-mailed all placers whose boxes I find (some of <br/>
course <br/>
&gt; who never respond) and above all - I do my best not to <br/>
get 'muggled' <br/>
&gt; while re-hiding. I recently hung around an extra 30+ minutes until <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; family that stopped to look at some ducks had walked away before re-<br/>
&gt; hiding a box. In some cases, I find that the last person to stamp <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; before me was someone who's been around alot longer on LBNA than <br/>
me - <br/>
&gt; but I find the box not sealed as well as could be etc.. So it's not <br/>
&gt; just newbies that err at re-hiding a box. And I've gotten rather <br/>
good <br/>
&gt; at finding tough boxes and some-time assumed missing boxes (**Item <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; note - MartianMaggot's "Crabbing Bridge" Box still exists - it was <br/>
&gt; water damaged and had not been found since 2004 - So, I was happy <br/>
&gt; finding that one last month) Once again, I'm not here to take <br/>
sides - <br/>
&gt; but offer an opinion. So here goes, I appreciate the view that <br/>
&gt; Letterboxing be shared 'one on one' among those with a common <br/>
&gt; interest or who would be more likely to maintain the integrity of <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; game. However, I certainly see the other side of having articles <br/>
&gt; that talk about the hobby - so that others who are not surrounded <br/>
by <br/>
&gt; clans of letterboxes in their developments can learn about it also. <br/>
&gt; If there was no article - I may have never learned of it - And I do <br/>
&gt; my best to take it as seriously as anyone I've talked to or met <br/>
from <br/>
&gt; LBNA or AQ. Now, that being said, cheesey fluff articles in news <br/>
&gt; mags with incorrect facts or those that 'out' letterbox locations <br/>
are <br/>
&gt; a disgrace - but a well written piece with some general info should <br/>
&gt; be welcomed. I am currently approaching the 100 mark for boxes <br/>
found <br/>
&gt; (Not all listed on AQ cause I'm too cheap to pay the money - but I <br/>
&gt; will probably buckle under eventually)and may hit the mark within <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; next month or so (If I get to hit Cyclonics 14 box extravaganza at <br/>
&gt; WCSP - that will easily do it and then some).....So what's the <br/>
point <br/>
&gt; here? (I forgot already..) Oh yeah, whether you find out from a <br/>
&gt; friend or a magazine - the type of person you are will dictate how <br/>
&gt; you treat Letterboxing overall. Case in point: I have a friend who <br/>
&gt; is a big outdoors hiker guy who was interested in letterboxing when <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; mentioned it briefly - I took him and his wife on a hunt, upon <br/>
&gt; finding the box they were anything but discrete and started posing <br/>
&gt; for pictures like they were standing at the North Rim of the Grand <br/>
&gt; Canyon. Although I tried to enlighten them further, they did not <br/>
&gt; take it seriously and figured no one would mess with a box that <br/>
they <br/>
&gt; found by mistake. The really did not understand the concept at all. <br/>
&gt; I quickly became annoyed to say the least. The final outcome, I <br/>
told <br/>
&gt; them I will not go letterboxing with them again (they could not <br/>
&gt; understand why???) and since I had never told them about the sites <br/>
&gt; relating to Letterboxing - they simply moved on to other <br/>
&gt; activities. So, is it better to learn of Letterboxing from a friend <br/>
&gt; or from a news article...that depends on the person in <br/>
&gt; question ...and as Forrest Gumps' mother told him..."life is like a <br/>
&gt; box of chocolates...you never know what you're gonna get". -John<br/>
&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "..Jesse, frankly many of us DON'T want Letterboxing spread around <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; this way, so please don't add another article that <br/>
&gt; attracts "infatuation" to the hobby. The majority of these folks <br/>
who <br/>
&gt; read the articles don't bother to *really* learn about Letterboxing <br/>
&gt; before jumping in to go on this exciting-sounding "treasure hunt", <br/>
&gt; often jeopardizing our 'boxes. It is a game of stealth, and they <br/>
&gt; usually just don't get that...<br/>
&gt; Please reconsider, and if you like the hobby so much, just <br/>
introduce <br/>
&gt; it to a few of your friends who you know will also enjoy and <br/>
respect <br/>
&gt; it. Word of mouth is the only way Letterboxing should be "spread" <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; my opinion! - sojourner.."<br/>
