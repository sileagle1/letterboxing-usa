I regret to inform you that the following letterboxes are no longer in<br/>
circulation. The Wis. mystery box is gone, and the Otis Redding<br/>
box in Madison is also missing. That one, the last time I checked before<br/>
finding it gone, had many entries logged before its demise. I see that the<br/>
pages I made for these boxes so long ago are still there, but I'm afraid<br/>
I no longer have the software/knowledge needed to change them, so<br/>
I'd appreciate it if someone could note their demise on the letterboxing-org<br/>
map. I miss participating in this group, but adjusting to a new job prevents me from pursuing many former interests. Thanks so much!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The missing "Mystery Box" is currently noted as missing by the owner <br/>
on the web site on this page; http://www.letterboxing.org/wi/wi.htm<br/>
<br/>
All three of the Madison letterboxes are currently listed as missing <br/>
as well on this page; http://www.letterboxing.org/wi/madison.htm<br/>
<br/>
"Otis Redding" (he died in a plane crash into Lake Mendota right <br/>
within the city of Madison) isn't mentioned by name but may be one of <br/>
the two "tribute" boxes listed on that page. Don't know for sure. I <br/>
never looked for it but a friend who tried two weeks ago couldn't <br/>
find it and was calling it the Otis Redding box so it must have been <br/>
listed by that name at some point.<br/>
<br/>
Another box that is still missing (reported on the site in February <br/>
2001) is the Aztalan box. We searched desperately for it. Found the <br/>
obvious spot but no luck. It could have easily been swept away by the <br/>
river water. The location is kind of a flood plain and close to the <br/>
water. Who knows. Maybe someone picked it up with peanut butter on <br/>
their hands and a racoon walked off with it later.<br/>
<br/>
The following are in good condition and were found in the past two <br/>
weeks; River Watch (Fort Atkinson), Tyranena (Lake Mills), Boyhood <br/>
Adventures (2 boxes in Fox Point), Mount Bieterman (Glendale), <br/>
Calatrava (Milwaukee) and Green One (Milwaukee).<br/>
<br/>
Last night in the dark we found Eagle (which is actually closer to <br/>
the city of Eagle than Milwaukee 40 miles away) and it was soaked in <br/>
a container of water, bag leaking. We've had heavy rains here in the <br/>
past week and that combined with an aging box (it's been there for 2 <br/>
years) did it in. Most the book is blurred but salvageable. It's <br/>
drying on my dining room table at the moment and will be returned in <br/>
a new box once it's useable again in the next week.<br/>
<br/>
More boxes please.<br/>
