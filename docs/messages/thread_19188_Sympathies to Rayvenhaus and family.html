                    <div class="plaintext-content">As a humble Dartmoor Letterboxer and LBNA follower may I extend my<br/>
sincerest sympathies to the Rayvenhaus family.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I am a stranger to almost everyone on this list and thousands<br/>
of miles away and have even been forced off the moor for some considerable<br/>
time, I have nevertheless enjoyed my Letterboxing thru reading the<br/>
postings on LBNA and have especially of course enjoyed following the<br/>
adventures of the famous Rayvenhaus family.  So it is as if we come to<br/>
know one another quite intimately, like an extended family thru this<br/>
curious e-medium of ours.<br/>
<br/>
The loss in one of our community is, therefore, a loss to us all.<br/>
<br/>
Life is very precious and sometimes we take it for granted.<br/>
<br/>
If I may quote from the Queen of my small nation , " The pain and grief<br/>
that we feel when we lose a friend or relation, is the inevitable price we<br/>
must pay for the gift of love ".<br/>
<br/>
Cherish that love always and celebrate the best of memories.<br/>
<br/>
My prayers are with you.....I know that they really do work.<br/>
