It was really nice meeting up with Team Kelly over at<br/>
Silver Lake on Sunday afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
We happened to catch them out checking on their boxes,<br/>
and we'd managed to convince them to tag along as we<br/>
hiked to their first box, promising hints &amp; clues as<br/>
to yet another box there, that they'd yet to find. <br/>
<br/>
A pleasant stroll ensued, on which GEKO, KINZ and<br/>
myself (ACE), beguiled them with tales of Victory and<br/>
Defeat in regards to local letterboxing quests. (Did<br/>
we tell them about our experience out at Haycock<br/>
Mt.whilst hunting for "Stony Faces? NO! We're barely<br/>
willing to dredge up that old horror story amongst<br/>
ourselves.)<br/>
<br/>
Team Kelly was gracious enough to follow along<br/>
quietly, barely hinting when our paths were led<br/>
astray. ("Ummm ... We're gonna rest here - We'll catch<br/>
up.")<br/>
<br/>
We eventually DID find the box, and offered<br/>
suggestions to TK as to where the clue list could be a<br/>
bit clearer. And JUST as we were going to stamp in,<br/>
and make exchanges in each other's books...<br/>
<br/>
... the sky opened up.<br/>
<br/>
It rained - it stopped. It drizzled a bit more. Then<br/>
it POURED. Then it slowed to a drizzle again. Then we<br/>
heard the thunder approaching.<br/>
<br/>
Oh dear... <br/>
<br/>
We got HALF stamped in to the first box in a three box<br/>
set. DANG!! (I think GEKO and I managed to make it<br/>
into the Logbook, as KINZ quickly stamped the box's<br/>
stamp into his book.)<br/>
<br/>
We gave up and put everything back, for fear of<br/>
damaging our Logbooks, and the one in the box with<br/>
stubborness. It was REALLY G<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, a glorious day.<br/>
<br/>
And that's the CLOSEST we've come, without actually<br/>
returning with a stamp. &gt;THIS&lt; close!<br/>
<br/>
What's the closest *you've* ever come to a box,<br/>
without actually getting it? And why? Rain being the<br/>
most obvious reason to abandon a hunt... But animals?<br/>
Strangers? <br/>
<br/>
I'm curious,<br/>

<br/>
Brighteyes and I (half of WeLetterbox) were in Carlisle hunting the <br/>
Luck is Where You Find it Series when the sky opened in August.<br/>
<br/>
We managed to get the stamp we were using back in the box and hidden <br/>
again (rain streaming into our eyes), and on the way to the parking <br/>
lot, car in sight, we grabbed a box hidden in our path that we had <br/>
spotted on our way IN to the woods...too many people had been around <br/>
to grab it earlier.<br/>
<br/>
We took that box to our car, stamped in, dried off, warmed up, and <br/>
even found - to our delight - a HH inside.....<br/>
<br/>
But when it came to putting it BACK!!!!...<br/>
<br/>
Just as the rain subsided, a man "appeared" (we really think he <br/>
just "appeared!") and stood three feet away from the re-hide location.<br/>
<br/>
We managed to look inconspicuous and hike BACK in to make sure the <br/>
other box was tightly sealed and hidden and, immerging from the woods <br/>
15 minutes later STILL found the man there!<br/>
<br/>
With no other options, we ended up taking the box with us to another <br/>
park and hunting another box.  We returned 45 minutes later to the <br/>
man STILL standing where the box had been.  We admitted defeat, <br/>
contacted the placer, and ended up taking the box home for the night <br/>
to return it a few days later!!!<br/>
<br/>
Craziness sometimes, but ALWAYS worth the adventure! :)<br/>

Mine was in Ridley Park, looking for Arbo's LB.<br/>
It was a long hike and by the time I actually found the box it was POURING.  <br/>
<br/>
I, decided it was best to consider the box FOUND, but forgo stamping up to save the logbooks.<br/>

Hiking back in the downpour will be one of my memorable LB stories....<br/>
