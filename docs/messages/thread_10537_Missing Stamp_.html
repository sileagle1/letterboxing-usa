<div>The good news is that I found my first box 
yesterday, the bad news is that there was everything but a stamp in it.  
Are there some boxes that don't have stamps?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I didn't see any contact info to notify anyone of 
the health of the box but I may have missed it since I was in a hurry.  The 
box the is missing the stamp is the Shore Bird letterbox in Huntington 
Beach, CA.</div>

Every letterbox should have a stamp in it.  That's the fun / <br/>
artistic part of the hobby.  The box may have had an unwelcome <br/>
visitor.  It may also be that the planter took the stamp out for <br/>
repair or replacement, and has not yet returned with a new stamp.<br/>
<br/>
The planter of the box may be identified in the clues or in the log <br/>
book.  Another way of finding the planter is to search the archives <br/>
with the name of the box.  The original e-mail with the clues may be <br/>
found with the planter's name.  Another way is to post a report to <br/>
this group with the state code and the name of the box in the <br/>
subject line.  That way the planter may browse the list of messages, <br/>
see their box name, and read the post.  Other boxers will also be <br/>
alerted as to the status of the box.<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing<br/>
