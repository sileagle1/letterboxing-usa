I had tons to say about hitchhikers (those of you who know me<br/>
know I agree with Val), so I'll keep it brief to one suggestion<br/>
for those who do enjoy charting of the comings and goings of the <br/>
venerable HH idea --<br/>
<br/>
There are tons of these free web-based bulletin board scripts<br/>
out there that allow threaded discussions.  These would be ideal<br/>
for hitchhikers.  Each hitchhiker could be a thread.  People who<br/>
find and place HHs can post to the thread corresponding to the<br/>
HH if they want to, and other people can read it if they want to.<br/>
It would work really well.  A competent webmaster can set one<br/>
of these scripts up in about an hour and then forget about it.<br/>
All the work would be off-loaded to the people interested in posting<br/>
the comings and goings of the HH.  Each HHs travels would be in<br/>
one thread.<br/>
<br/>
(People who don't want their HH info posted would put this desire<br/>
with their HH -- I'm not part of the HH scene, but I imagine this<br/>
etiquette may already be in place, or should be).<br/>
<br/>
Another random thought for people who like abbreviations in their<br/>
subject lines - use "HH" (is that a state?) for HH-related posts on<br/>
the list ...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

Thanks for agreeing with me I feel like I got stomped on for the desire to follow the travels of a HH. I in no way want to post where it's been planted for the next stop, (where it's going,) just who found it, and where it's been. That certainly can't be taking the fun away from anyone. I read the travels on the HH at the bottom of the page and find it interesting how they move from state to state. I also believe a separate web page is a very good idea as not to burden LbNa any more than they already are. I own a domain but need the resources and know how on web design. Going to school for it next week. Perhaps I can help out a little later with such a project. <br/>
The letterboxing community is filled with such great people......some want to follow HH's and some don't, ....to each his own.<br/>

various LB sites for the planter's name and see what you can find.  <br/>
Or, post the planter's name here and see if anyone knows them.  <br/>
People's emails change from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
As for posting the find:  Not everyone will list their HH -- or even <br/>
their boxes!  You may not be able to log it on a site, but you surely <br/>
can count it yourself.  Now your LB sig can include "HH1"!<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations!  I remember the first HH I found.  I was literally <br/>
dancing around.<br/>
<br/>
I have only found one other since then, but I have just gotten back <br/>
into LBing after almost a 2 year break, so maybe I'll be finding <br/>
more.  (hope, hope)<br/>

I'm so happy for you!<br/>

If not, go to letterboxing.org, click on "search boxes", when that page<br/>
opens up, scroll down and look thru "pick a placer" for the name.  Then<br/>
click on one of Schizokeet's four boxes, click on maybe the "Mystic II" box<br/>
which was placed as recently as the middle of last year, and try contacting<br/>
him/her/them about the HH by clicking the "contact placer" on the clue page.<br/>
That might be an up-to-date email addy.<br/>

Of course, if you've already tried that route, then just disregard the<br/>
above.<br/>

Also, check the front of the logbook.  Usually there is a message asking the finder to email them and let them know it's still out there and not MIA.  =)  Then, we you go to a different area, you can release the HH.  Stamp the HH logbook with the stamp from the box you released it in, and the date.  You can also check out letterboxing.org or Atlasquest.com and see if the HH is listed on there as well.  I hope that helps ya out a bit.  Happy boxing!! =)<br/>
