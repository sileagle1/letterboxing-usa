the Glacial Potholes.  Here are the links to the clues.  The boxes can <br/>
easily be done in one day (they're both pretty short) and Shelburne Falls <br/>
is one of my favorite little towns.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Rebecca, thanks for hiding these boxes--I love Shelburne Falls. Yyou <br/>
are right, it's definitely worth a visit, especially in summer when the <br/>
Bridge of Flowers is in bloom.<br/>
<br/>
Should anyone need persuading to go to Shelburne Falls, what it offers <br/>
is a very pleasant "main street" with a cool medieval shop full of <br/>
books on everything and anything related to the Middle Ages, also <br/>
armor, Tarot cards, Celtic CDs, all very eclectic and fun.  Would-be <br/>
wizards will probably find fun things there.<br/>
<br/>
There's also Shelburne Falls Coffee Roasters, well worth a stop, and <br/>
several shops/studios with excellent work by local artisans--weavers, <br/>
jewelry makers, glassblowers, etc.  Some are on the main drag and some <br/>
are on the street that takes you to the glacial potholes (don't miss <br/>
those!).<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to hunting these boxes...<br/>
