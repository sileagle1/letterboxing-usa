Who would have thought that our biggest letterboxing day ever would <br/>
come just last Saturday in conjunction with a great gathering out in <br/>
western NY! Talk about tremendous growth, when I drove out that way <br/>
just last year on my way to Colorado, I planted RTRW's "Silliness in <br/>
Chataugua" because the only other box along that part of my route had <br/>
already gone missing! Now, thanks to the efforts of some very <br/>
dedicated folks like the Elba Onions, the Sprite and the Highlander, <br/>
Team Dakota and others, this area is simply teeming with letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
Until very recently we weren't even aware of all this "new growth". <br/>
We'd heard something about a gathering somewhere out there, but Pete <br/>
had said he didn't feel like driving that far, and we thought we'd be <br/>
going to the Chatfield Hollow Gathering in CT anyway. It wasn't until <br/>
Thursday that we took a look at the NY index and noticed how many <br/>
boxes were out there that we finally printed out a few clues. The <br/>
combination of meeting the folks who planted all these "thankful <br/>
boxes" and letterboxing in a new location at the same time was just <br/>
too big of a draw for us, so off we went!<br/>
<br/>
Friday morning saw us dashing through the snow near Binghampton for <br/>
the new "Winter Wonderland" boxes, then bursting out into the clear <br/>
cold afternoon sunshine of Batavia for some very interesting <br/>
letterbox surprises. We stayed the night there and even got to pick <br/>
up a few more clues the next morning from the internet access in the <br/>
motel lobby!<br/>
<br/>
Saturday morning we went scouting for "thankfuls"(spirit, refuge, <br/>
etc.) on our way to the gathering, where we got a nice warm welcome <br/>
from the Sprite and others that kept us going - along with the hot <br/>
chili - for the rest of that very cold day! We did one big series <br/>
after another in the lovely Royalton Ravine, picked up a cute cupcake <br/>
on the way, and got back to the gathering pavilion just in time for <br/>
group pictures and my 6000th box, the first of the "Thankful for <br/>
Donations" series that just happened to be resting for the moment in <br/>
a nearby bunk tree. It was Laurette's wandering box called "Where's <br/>
Wanda?" that depicts me with my glasses and red beret, and it had <br/>
already wandered around the country quite a bit itself - now how cool <br/>
is that!?!<br/>
<br/>
Well, by now it was already getting dark, so we finished off that <br/>
series and a few more "Thankfuls" along the Erie Canal( and even <br/>
drove under it at one point!) as we headed back to Batavia for the <br/>
night. In counting up our stamps that evening, we were amazed to find <br/>
that we had reached a "grand one-day total" of 75 finds( including 6 <br/>
hitchers and one personal traveler) and 27 exchanges. WOW-what a day!<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday we "thankfully" boxed our way eastward and even did a <br/>
couple of "Thruway boxes", bringing our F-count for the weekend to <br/>
well over 100 boxes, for which we are indeed very thankful. We're <br/>
also thankful for being able to "reel in" a few of the boxes planted <br/>
for the Chatfield Hollow Gathering, too. Even the very last box we <br/>
found today was a bonus called "Thank You". So, a great big "thank <br/>
you" from us to everyone who helped make this weekend so very special!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers and Happy Thanksgiving,<br/>

I know.  Prior to your planting Silliness, I had visited every<br/>
letterbox in Western New York between Rochester NY and Eire PA... both<br/>
of them!  And now, 18 months later, letterboxing is flourishing!  It's<br/>
wonderful.  I've been re-inspired to plant a series that I had<br/>
considered back when LBs were scarce.  The problem is, I'm now in Grad<br/>
School and won't have time to carve stamps until the summer.   I guess<br/>
folks are just going to have to wait. :D<br/>
