<br/>
I received the container you sent.  Thanks for the speedy reply!  I am<br/>
going to give it a try.  Being used to the sandwich keepers, I have been<br/>
able to keep all the paperwork flat.  This will neccesitate rolling<br/>
things up.  I'll give it a try &amp; see how it all works out.  I noticed<br/>
some condensation in one of my boxes.  Fortunately everything is packed<br/>
in a ziploc.  Someone posted as to the short life of the ziplocs.  I<br/>
haven't seen any degradation as of yet, but these boxes are near enough<br/>
that I'll try to remmeber &amp; carry an extra bag or two when I check them,<br/>
in case replacements are neccesary (one for the dog's leavings, one for<br/>
the letterboxes).<br/>
<br/>
The waterproof paper feels as if it is coated.  I like the "tooth" the<br/>
coating gives.  I may try some art experiments with liquid media on this<br/>
stuff, just for kicks.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Dennis!<br/>
I'm with you..I have not dug a hole to place a box in.I do look for likely <br/>
places to "plant" that are already there in the natural surrounding, but I <br/>
have moved rocks and deepened the area slightly below them to place a box in <br/>
and then covered the box with the rocks to make the "plant" stable and as <br/>
natural looking as possible.I want fellow boxers to be able to locate my <br/>
boxes after the hunt but also want have them seem invisible to the regular <br/>
hiker. It seems to be a sticky issue. I can understand why some could view <br/>
our "game, hobby, sport,fun" as littering..I myself am deeply connected to <br/>
our open spaces and rejoice while hiking and or 'boxing..it is a tonic to my <br/>
soul to step away for a moment or afternoon from the fast paced world we <br/>
live in..<br/>
Letterboxing has me out on the trails more than ever and I think that's <br/>
great for me and the Parks in general.I pick up litter if I come across it <br/>
and pack it out and I've become an active enthusiast of open spaces instead <br/>
of a passive bystander, that's good for everyone.<br/>
I see no reason why we will not be able to interface with the Nat'l. Park <br/>
system. We might have to change how and where we plant in that system but it <br/>
doesn't have to be the end of 'boxing in those areas.<br/>
There are lots of places to "hide" letterboxes and I do not believe we have <br/>
touched the surface on that one..<br/>
Personally, I like the hike and the hunt and finding a physical box and <br/>
stamp.I'm would not choose to look for virtual boxes yet..but then I just <br/>
started using a computer at Christmas so who knows..<lol><br/>
I believe we have a great thing going but all relationships that last <br/>
require some compromise and our relationship with the Nat'l. Park system is <br/>
worth the effort to keep the lines of communication open between us.<br/>
      Great 'boxing to all!! See Joy<br/>
<br/>
P.S. The Dollar Store boxes ($1- each) I've found seem to have a good seal, <br/>
the needed space for stamp,postcards,letterbox explanations,pencil and 3x5 <br/>
logbook, I do double bag paper goods using zip lock double guard freezer <br/>
bags.<br/>

<br/>
This is just one man's opinion, but I always thought the ban on digging referred to *finding* letterboxes. I.e., you should never have to take a shovel with you to find one. Within reasonable limits, it's always seemed more or less OK to me to "improve on nature" a little bit by enlarging a niche in a boulder field, or moving some leaf litter to one side, or (yes) extracting a quantity of mineral soil sufficient to accommodate the shape of a small storage container from under a rock. The digging that we don't do, I've always thought, is in the context of finding, rather than placing letterboxes. It should never be necessary to dig to find one. THAT should be a cardinal rule, IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
That said, whenever remotely possible, I place my letterboxes without ANY digging. I've only had to scoop out some sand once.<br/>

I think "no digging" is in reference to hiding the box so that the hunter has <br/>
to dig it up.  I have hid several boxes flush with the surface also.  The <br/>
impact is less than moving rocks to cover the box.   :o)<br/>

Originally boxes on Dartmoor were all in ammo boxes, however since<br/>
Dartmoor is also used by the military for exercises, there have been<br/>
instances of boxers opening up ammo boxes on the moor expecting to<br/>
find a stamp and log book, and finding live ammunition. :-(<br/>
Recently the park rangers have been removing letterboxes contained in<br/>
ammo boxes and leaving a note in its place.<br/>
On the subject of the park management's attitude to letterboxing, they<br/>
seem on the whole to be quite supportive, providing one doesn't do<br/>
anythiing stupid like planting boxes in the numerous ancient monuments<br/>
on the moor.<br/>
<br/>
Hope my thoughts are of interest<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On our road/letterboxing trip through Wy.,Mt.,Utah,Idaho, Gwen &amp; I came across some containers at a war surplus store in Idaho Falls. They are made of plastic,a little larger than a pack of cigarettes,olive drab,and cost 99 cents. They held "Decon" kits, and are waterproof. They seem to be perfect for letterboxing. I peeled off the label and sanded off the raised writing on the top, and one was placed in our Seal Beach Town Tour yesterday (clues to be posted soon). Check out your local surplus store. Don <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That sounds like a good price but they are a solid color. The State <br/>
park service in MD requested that clear containers be used. It is <br/>
probably a security issue. Anyway you might want to rethink the <br/>
bargin if you have to replace them all with clear containers in the <br/>
next year or so. Just a thought.<br/>
