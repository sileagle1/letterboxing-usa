<div>Well,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I suppose it was bound to happen. The "Craigs 
Castle" letterbox in Meriden, CT has been vandalized sometime between 7/23 and 
8/19. I rode my bike up the auto road, to the castle to check on the box, and to 
get myself a good workout. What I found was the lid to the box, the log 
book (still can't believe my luck there) and the "About Letterboxing" page still 
in it's protective baggie. No stamp, ink pad, pen or bottom of the box was to be 
found. Man, if you were any of the ones who have found this box in its hidden 
location, could you believe that someone actually uncovered it by accident? I 
know this spot is a common party place (the general area anyway) and that this 
stuff happens all the time but, the kids, myself included, were really 
disappointed in finding our hard work ruined by insensitive idiots. Who knows, 
when stamping in someone may have inadvertently revealed the hiding spot and let 
the door wide open for a few drunken fools to see what all the rummaging about 
in the bushes really was. We all know to stamp in "secretly" especially when 
there are people milling about the general area. It is always a good practice at 
least. I know I'm guilty of not doing just that on more than a few occasions. We 
also all know to replace the box and hid it as well as possible so no part of 
the box is showing that may catch the eye of an inquisitive unwanted 
guest.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well, in any event, the "Craigs Castle" letterbox 
is temporarily out of commission and will be back in action shortly with a new 
and improved stamp and in a more secure hiding spot. I think I will use the old 
log book though. It will tell of its troubles and continue to embrace all its 
travelers. Its a bit worn and curled due to the weather but so what 
right?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you for letting me vent and good boxing to 
all.</div>
