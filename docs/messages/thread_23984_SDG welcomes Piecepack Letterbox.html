Letterbox online. The experience is somewhat like virtual<br/>
letterboxing, but more social. You won't get as much fresh air and<br/>
sunshine as you do from real-life letterboxing, but you _can_ do it on<br/>
a lunch or coffee break at work!<br/>
<br/>
If you were intrigued by the idea of a letterboxing board game when it<br/>
was announced, but didn't want to make or buy the equipment<br/>
<http: www.piecepack.org="">, this is an ideal way to jump right in.<br/>

I am pleased to announce the addition of Piecepack Letterbox to the<br/>
SDG lineup.  It's a little out of the mainstream as far as the rest of<br/>
the games go, but is a heck of a lot of fun.  Support for 3-6 players<br/>
is implemented.  Come check us out!<br/>

P.S. For those that don't know, SDG is a 100% free, asynchronous<br/>
website for playing (mostly) abstract strategy games with other<br/>
people.  Other piecepack games on the site include Alien City and<br/>
Froggy Bottom.<br/>
