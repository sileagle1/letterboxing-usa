I would like to thank Chuck and Molly, Chickabirdie, the Needeeps with all the work they put into this Gathering.  <br/>
<br/>
To everyone that helped us out by Volunteering.  Gardner/Teacher/Catlover for all the work she did for us.  Paul, Dave, and at this moment Barbara's sisters name escapes me (sorry) for all the cooking you all did.  Pinetree for bring table and chairs. And many others that it's just to long to list.  Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to Gary and Danny Vinal for coming over ever once in awhile to see if myself and Teach needed something to eat or drink.  (The Event Table line was long.  Someone told us it took an average of 45 mins. to go through the line)<br/>
<br/>
The Alphabet Bandits kids for playing with my kids and they said they had a great time.<br/>
<br/>
To all the Monster Maker for sending in their boxes.  This event was a hugh success because of all of you making such wonderful boxes.<br/>
<br/>
And to EVERYONE that showed up for the gathering.  I'm not going to give an estimate on how many people showed up but, it was ALOT.<br/>
<br/>
If I missed anyone sorry, so many people to thank.  Teach and Preach (Robin and Dan)<br/>
