   Chapter Two *** TURTLES GIFT TO STANLEY ***<br/>
<br/>
   Princess Turtle spent many nights dreaming of the beautiful day <br/>
she spent with her Stanley. She wondered. What could she possibly <br/>
give him that would be as wonderful in return? She spent all her hard <br/>
earned money on this perfect gift. The Princess knew Stanley would <br/>
love it and decided she would give it to him where they ended that <br/>
beautiful day.<br/>
<br/>
After finding #3 of Stanley's Surprise face the paved path. Look to <br/>
your right, walk 13 steps in that direction to the biggest tree. This <br/>
is a micro-box with a black lid. Please rehide carefully. THE END<br/>
