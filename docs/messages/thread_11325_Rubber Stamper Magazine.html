<div>Was in Michael's today, using my 40% off coupon to 
get another sheet of pink stuff.  As I was leaving, checked out the 
magazine rack.  Looked thru a copy of Rubber Stamper magazine.  
Although it is oriented to buying and using stamps, with no info on carving your 
own that I noticed, it has lots of pictures and artwork that could be used for 
ideas for your stamps.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What also caught my eye were the advertisements for 
Stamping shows and Stamping and Scrapbooking shows, and Scrapbooking and 
Stamping shows, all around the country.  Didn't get the details, but they 
seem to be all over.  A good place to have a mini-gathering, possibly 
inquire about having a (hopefully free) table on Letterboxing.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There is one in Portland at the Oregon Convention Center 
in August, must be pretty big to warrant that venue.  One at the 
Puyallup Fairgrounds in March or May (was in a hurry to get back to work so 
didn't look to closely (just like I read the clue sheets) (or my forgetter was 
working well).  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The magazine was $5.99 (more in Canada), and should likely 
be at your local craft supply outlet.  If not, you can check them out 
at <a href="http://www.rubberstamper.com">www.rubberstamper.com</a> but there 
isn't much info other than subscriptions and back issues and a few 
projects.</div>
