<br/>
  My name is Jeremy Chapman; I discovered letterboxing a couple years ago,<br/>
and it's awesome.  I hid my first letterbox last month, and I have two<br/>
questions about it.<br/>
<br/>
 1) I hid it while I was visiting the U.S.-owned island of Guam.<br/>
Understandably, Guam is not shown anywhere on the website's North America<br/>
map, even though it is technically part of America.  Should I just try to<br/>
add the box in the "outside of North America" section?<br/>
<br/>
2) Also, I have pictures and even video footage of the walk along the beach<br/>
that leads up to the spot where I hid the Guam box.  I'd love to post the<br/>
video-hints on YouTube and then get a link to it from<br/>
letterboxing.org....what do we think?  Possible?<br/>
<br/>
Again, I've really enjoyed letterboxing with my girlfriend Amy - so thank<br/>
you!<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing from you...<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
Jeremy<br/>

<br/>
Anyhoo, Guam is on the list of places for letterboxing.org, so just <br/>
enter your box normally. (It's down at the end of the list of <br/>
states). And if you want to add external links to you-tube, go right <br/>
ahead. You can make them html tags in your clues or just type them <br/>
out longhand. Great idea.<br/>
