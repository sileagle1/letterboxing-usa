Basically, you use the needles just as you would an X-Acto knife.  They <br/>
have a super sharp, super fine point and I understand they work well for <br/>
very small detail work.<br/>

Possession may not necessarily be a violation of Federal law. If you <br/>
are possessing needles for veterinary use then that is certainly okay <br/>
otherwise many small farm farmers would be in jail.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a feed store or tack store in your area that would be a <br/>
good place to ask if they have them on hand.<br/>
<br/>
An alternative to the detail work requiring needles would be to <br/>
squeeze a speedball #1 down to a #1/2. Hold the #1 nib in a candle <br/>
flame and squeeze down with vice grips while holding a knife blade in <br/>
the #1 nib groove with your third hand. Once smaller then resharpen.<br/>

&gt; I still dont get the point!  A knife has an edge, a needle a point.<br/>
 Cant<br/>
&gt; see slicing through some soft speedball material with a needle. <br/>
Now, if you<br/>
&gt; could use it like a steel straw  poke it into the carving medium  hold<br/>
&gt; your finger over the end to create a vacuum, then pull up, producing a<br/>
&gt; perfect, albeit small, circle cut into the speedball, well, then<br/>
maybe.  Or,<br/>
&gt; maybe youre supposed to fill the hypodermic with some solution that<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; harden later, and inject your stamp where you carved too much away,<br/>
and pump<br/>
&gt; back to fill the mistake?  I dont think so.  Sorry to be a pain,<br/>
but I just<br/>
&gt; cant see it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks, Nathan, for trying to explain.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But, as to availability, are these needles youre referring to<br/>
anything like<br/>
&gt; what diabetics use for insulin?  Can those (which my bro-in-law<br/>
disposes of,<br/>
&gt; three times a day) be used?  A thought.<br/>

 They<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are just about at the point of overkill with this hypodermic needles for carving.  If you go to any farm supply store, veterinarian who is not too anal, or pharmacy you can get needles.  Check out the gauges yourself or just buy a variety of sizes...they are inexpensive.  If you are in the suburbs or a rural area just look in the yellow pages under agricultural suppliers, e.g. Farm and Ranch, Farm and Fleet, TSC, Tractor Supply Company.  If that is a no go, check grain and feed, grain elevators, feed and seed, farmer's cooperatives, etc.  You can surely find some source that sells animal vaccines, antibiotics, etc., and they will sell hypodermics needed to administer these meds.  <br/>
Next, no you do not need a handle...at the non-pointed end of the needle there will be a wider top, maybe about 1/3 to 1/2 inch kind of a cup deal where the needle attaches to the syringe.  You do not need to buy the syringes, just the needles.  Just use the needle without a handle.   You can buy the needles for about 25 cents each, or they can be purchased by the box...buy them by the case if you want.  I went with my son to his place of employment, after hours, chose a selection of different gauges to try, charged them to our farm account, and was home in about half an hour.  He works at a farmers cooperative grain elevator.  I am a farm wife.  If you live in the country, or the suburbs, you don't have a problem.  If you are in the city, talk to your pharmacist.<br/>

&gt; Not in Massachusetts it's not. I tell you this as a paramedic, and as a<br/>

&gt; You can not buy needles anywhere in MA, without a prescription, for any<br/>

&gt; Take a look around any MA ED these days and notice that the "real" needles<br/>
<br/>
&gt; (not the current needleless systems that most hospitals use to prevent<br/>

&gt; Here in MD they keep them behind the pharmacy counter, but all you have<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; to do is request them and they'll sell them to you.  I buy them to give<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; meds to my son via his gtube, but the pharmacists don't know that; I<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; just go and tell them I want to buy 6 or 10 or 20 insulin syringes and<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; they bag them up and sell them for about 20 cents each.<br/>

&gt; &gt; They are not illegal in have in Ohio. I don't think they're illegal in<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; most<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; states.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; They are very readily available.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I would suggest that people who want to use them check with their<br/>
local<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; authorities to see if there is any issue with them, if in doubt.<br/>

If you go somewhere that they are considered legal, nobody will check you to make sure you are a citizen of their state. That's not the way the laws work.<br/>
But you might be in real trouble if you get caught taking them over state lines to a state that has some crazy anti-needle policy.<br/>
