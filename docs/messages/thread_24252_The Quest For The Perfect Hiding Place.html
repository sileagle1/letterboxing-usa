                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are discussing this topic on the TX List, but I thought it <br/>
warranted discussion here, too.  It would be interesting to hear <br/>
thoughts, especially from the more experienced placers, on this <br/>
subject.  Here are mine:<br/>
<br/>
Even though a perfect hiding place probably doesn't exist, all <br/>
letterboxers strive to find the best one they can when placing a <br/>
box.  But what constitutes the perfect hiding place?  For me, ideally <br/>
it would be a place easy to get to but not likely to be visited by <br/>
noxers; safe from weather, critters and evil plants; and near a <br/>
secluded bench or place to sit while stamping with no bugs.  But even <br/>
if this place could be found, there is no guarantee it would stay <br/>
that way since the environment is constantly changing and a box is <br/>
only hidden as well as the last finder left it.  Therefore, I'm <br/>
afraid luck plays a bigger part in box longevity than we would like.  <br/>
It is still important to find the best hiding spot you can, but <br/>
without a little luck, your box still might not make it.<br/>
<br/>
My first placed box (Zube Zephyr) is the perfect example of the "luck <br/>
factor".  I did find a secluded spot rarely, if ever, visited by <br/>
noxers, but it was still found by several Geocachers before TX <br/>
Letterboxers finally arrived.  Luckily it survived.  I also concealed <br/>
it behind a log on the ground thinking that would protect it further, <br/>
not realizing the nearby creek was prone to flooding.  Sure enough, a <br/>
flood came and washed the box away, but by sheer chance a letterboxer <br/>
visited the next day and found it floating in the creek nearby.  They <br/>
salvaged the contents that were still relatively dry thanks to <br/>
ziplock bags and rehid the box.  Another lucky break.  I now have the <br/>
box wrapped in camo tape and strapped to the back of a tree 4 feet <br/>
above ground near the original spot.  I figured it needed all the <br/>
protection I could give it since it has probably used up all its luck <br/>
quota.<br/>
<br/>
When I first started placing boxes, I used full size tupperware <br/>
without camo and usually hid them beneath trees covered with sticks <br/>
not too far off trail.  My assumption was that if I covered it so <br/>
well that even I couldn't see it, that would be good enough.  I <br/>
learned the hard way that critters, weather and future finders would <br/>
eventually leave the box exposed, so I revised my strategy.  I <br/>
started hiding further off trail, putting them on the back side of <br/>
trees and covering them with rocks instead of sticks when possible.  <br/>
I wanted the box to remain covered longer (rocks), but to remain <br/>
somewhat hidden even if no longer covered.  I also started hiding <br/>
mainly microboxes since they are easier to hide and less intrusive.  <br/>
Once I found out about camo tape, I started using that, too.  Now I <br/>
have even started using paper clip hooks to hang the micro higher off <br/>
the ground.  My favorite hiding place, though hard to find, is a rock <br/>
wall.  If hidden within, especially on the back side, a box is <br/>
protected from weather, critters and noxers for a long time.  Trees <br/>
die, sticks decay, but rocks last!<br/>
<br/>
However, even if I use all my experience and find a great hiding <br/>
spot, the box still might be compromised by the clues themselves.  <br/>
Between Rangers and malicious people, some well hidden boxes still go <br/>
missing.  One solution is to make every box WOM or disguise the clues <br/>
in some manner.  I have done this for some, but since I want my boxes <br/>
to be found by many people, I am willing to risk the exposure by <br/>
posting most of my clues on LBNA.  So far I have lost less than 10% <br/>
of my boxes, which I figure is about as good as I can get with <br/>
published clues.<br/>

how do you disguise the box when you hang it from a tree?  I mean, it is<br/>
just hanging there so the finder can reach up and grab it?<br/>
