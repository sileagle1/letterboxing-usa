<br/>
We finally got out to Oxbow Park and scored Cara's prize sockeye salmon.<br/>
This is a stamp image and a park worth pursuing!  We were in good<br/>
company,  Thom Cheney and his kid were the first to stamp in and Funhog<br/>
and Amanda in Seattle have been there recently.  Shockingly, I did not<br/>
see Ryan's famous signature spider stamp among the bunch.  It's just a<br/>
matter of time, though I'm sure.    That guy doesn't miss out on<br/>
beautiful places for long!<br/>
<br/>
What a gorgeous fall day on the Sandy River.  I can't recall ever being<br/>
there, though my mom says we went when we were kids.  We scouted the<br/>
river out thinking about canoeing it all the way down to the Columbia,<br/>
but we may have to wait till spring when there will hopefully be more<br/>
water.  Meanwhile I wouldn't mind planting a bunch of boxes in that<br/>
park, myself.  <br/>
<br/>
We didn't attempt to find box #2 since everyone says it's missing and<br/>
the sun was lowering in the West.  They lock the gates at legal sunset,<br/>
so we probably got out just in the nick of time.  It looks like they<br/>
have a nice campground there, too.  I was very impressed.   The fall<br/>
colors are so vivid and the salmon are supposedly spawning, now, as<br/>
well.  <br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
