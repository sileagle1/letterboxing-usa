You may want to check out boxes in Warren, Morris, and Passaic <br/>
counties.  There aren't any listed boxes in Sussex.  <br/>

letterboxing during my down time by myself (with my dog of course.)  <br/>
It looks like Saturday I will be done with the show by 11:00 AM so I <br/>
will have lots of time to myself.  Since I am not very good at <br/>
mysteries, hearing that 20% of NJ boxes are mysteries is not good <br/>
news.  I guess I have to go out &amp; buy a good map of the area. LOL.<br/>
