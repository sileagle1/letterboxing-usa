&gt; My only question is about the<br/>
&gt; disclaimer.  I know that you have to add the statement about reading<br/>
&gt; it but do I have to have it included in my clues or is this something <br/>
&gt; that is linked to the site somewhere?<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Judi!<br/>
<br/>
First, as a gentle reminder, remember to include the state abbreviation<br/>
in the Subject line for new clues -- this helps the various Webmasters<br/>
immensely!<br/>
<br/>
Second, the Disclaimer is a normal part of the LbNA page where your clues <br/>
will go because it will actually reside in a "courtesy page" within the<br/>
LbNA's Web (we do this when posters don't have Web space of their own).<br/>
<br/>
Third, remember to always include the following: (thanks, Judi, for<br/>
remembering these!)Name of the box, Nearest City, COUNTY, and State of<br/>
the box . This helps us determine the correct region of a state.<br/>
<br/>
Great job with the clues!<br/>
