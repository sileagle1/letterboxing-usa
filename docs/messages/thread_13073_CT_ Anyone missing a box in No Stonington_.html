                    <div class="plaintext-content">Heidi and I were showing her family our log book etc this weekend <br/>
and her Uncle said he found a box in North Stonington. Unfortunately <br/>
he's the highway dept foreman and found the box in an old rotten <br/>
tree that they cut down. He didn't remember where they had found it <br/>
but he does have it in his posession (safe and sound). He'll be <br/>
returning it to us shortly and we'll try to figure out who's it <br/>
is... but in the mean time if this rings a bell, let us know!<br/>

Heidi's camping, Steve just got home from camping. Found 1 drive up <br/>
in Bozrah today and placed the Odetah Campground box, with clues to <br/>
follow in the next few days (its a wicked easy drive up!)<br/>
