Letterbox in Naugatuck have finally been opened. However, when I went <br/>
to inspect the box today I found that somebody took it upon <br/>
themselves to place a pretty gold foiled box in my headstone. Well, <br/>
as one who could never just leave well enough alone I took it upon <br/>
myself to see who would invade my spot.....an errant letterboxer, a <br/>
over jealous geocacher but noooooo. Apparently some folks take this <br/>
whole cemetary thing quite serioulsy and they chose my perfect <br/>
location to deposit their tiny dearly departed.<br/>
Being totally unprepared to deal with the situation at hand I let out <br/>
a yell and tossed the little critter back to it's final rest place(at <br/>
least for the time being.<br/>
It is on the far side away from the letterbox for those brave enough <br/>
to compete with the dead for a stamp I would encourage you to cover <br/>
your nostrils with a hanky however. In the mean time I will try to <br/>
figure out the most respectful way to rid ones letterbox of an actual <br/>
dead body.<br/>
And to think my biggest concern was vandals!!!!<br/>
