This was placed by DS in Oklahoma.  I just wanted to say thank you for <br/>
this box, too.  One note of concern, however:  When I reached the box, <br/>
I found myself in a forest of poison ivy!!!  I placed several boxes <br/>
somewhere else at about the same time as you placed this one.  There <br/>
was no poison ivy anywhere, but when i went to check on them a week and <br/>
a half later, it was everywhere!!!  I couldn't believe it.  So I <br/>
thought that you probably didn't place this box with the knowledge that <br/>
poison ivy was going to be abundant and flourishing in that very spot <br/>
with the first days of spring, and I thought you should know.  I'm <br/>
beginning to wonder if all my boxes are in the midst of poison ivy cuz <br/>
I usually place during the winter.  Yikes!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
