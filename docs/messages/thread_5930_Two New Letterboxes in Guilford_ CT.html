Planted June 30, 2002 by Bluebird<br/>
<br/>
Two boxes and a walk on a level woodland trail which can be <br/>
completed in about 45 minutes.<br/>
This trail system is in flux, with lots of work in progress. If trail <br/>
colors change, I will update the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Location: Bittner Park is located on Route 77 in Guilford. The <br/>
park is a little over 2.5 miles north of Exit 58 off I95 in Guilford, <br/>
and 1.5 south of Route 80 if you're coming in from the north. You <br/>
will see a playground, field and on-going expansion.<br/>
<br/>
When you enter Bittner Park, go right around the flagpole and <br/>
turn right by the soccer fields into another, larger parking area. <br/>
Go all the way to its northern end, park, and then go to the lot's <br/>
northeast corner to find the trail through the field that is furthest <br/>
right, along the woods.<br/>
<br/>
Follow that trail into the woods, very soon crossing a small <br/>
bridge. Continue over 2 more wetland bridges and stroll along <br/>
the lovely West River for about 5 minutes. Just before the next <br/>
bridge, go left onto a trail with white rectangular blazes (you will <br/>
soon start seeing the blazes). Up a short way go right onto <br/>
orange, then go right at Heather's tree, still on orange. Pass a <br/>
trail on your right. Look for the last rock on the right before the <br/>
field; the Playground Letterbox is hidden on it!<br/>
<br/>
Enter the field, continuing straight across, going straight still on <br/>
orange, west. You'll see a fence on your right, stay left. Continue <br/>
straight  the end is in sight! Just before the archway, go left off <br/>
the trail to the 6th large rock in the front row. Under its southern <br/>
edge, find the Schoolside Letterbox. (a letterboxer's classroom <br/>
is near!)<br/>
<br/>
Return to the trail, back the way you came. Very soon take the <br/>
first right, onto green. Go right to stay on it and then left at the <br/>
fork. Get onto the red on the right and cross the bridge at the <br/>
bottom of the steps. Go west to stay on red just a little way up <br/>
then go right at the T to stay on red. After straight walking for 5 <br/>
minutes or less you will pass the first bridge you crossed and <br/>
will soon be back to your vehicle!<br/>
