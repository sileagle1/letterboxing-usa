                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
John and I went to the Lincoln City area of the Oregon Coast for <br/>
SOLV's Fall Beach Clean Up on Saturday and got a little letterboxing <br/>
in while we were at it.<br/>
<br/>
We tried for a few. We think Fishing Rock might have gotten "cleaned<br/>
up" during the event, as we think we were in the right place and<br/>
there were rocks and tree duff, but no box where we looked. Fogarty<br/>
Creek Treasures of the Sea #1 is no longer there, but there certainly<br/>
is a big ammo box geocache with nothing much to offer. I looked<br/>
later and found I already had this series in my logbook anyway. We<br/>
couldn't really look for Fogarty Flower as there was a big wedding<br/>
reception going on in the pavillion and there was no way of getting<br/>
around that. We couldn't really blend in and look like guests as our<br/>
attire was early beach clean up rather than evening formal. Maybe<br/>
next time. It was dark by the time we sought out Tranquility in Taft<br/>
and came away empty-handed on that one, as well. It might be there,<br/>
but the lack of light and abundance of blackberry brambles made us<br/>
give up easily on that one.<br/>
<br/>
We were successful at Chris the Crab @ Cape Foulweather (stamp is<br/>
broken in two, but still completely stampable and box is not very<br/>
well-hidden (I did the best I could to rehide). We got Sailing the<br/>
High Seas. Delightful clues and the original stamp on the logbook<br/>
looked like it was awesome! Too bad some dork traded it for a Star<br/>
Student storebought piece of crap (There is also a geocache in the<br/>
same spot as this letterbox). If it ever gets replaced with a new<br/>
stamp like the old I will happily try for it again. What a sweet<br/>
piece of art! Last but not least we were able to locate the Bella<br/>
Beach LB. Very clever hiding spot! We would have come away without<br/>
that one if it weren't for John, the very clever love of my life.<br/>
<br/>
In the future we will try to bag Ozzy's Box, Kernville, and Mossy<br/>
Creek, but couldn't do it this time around because the timing and the<br/>
tides weren't in our favor when we were over that way. It's nice<br/>
there are so many letterboxes to seek over this way these days.<br/>
<br/>
While in the vicinity I also carved and placed "Son of Devil's Punch<br/>
Bowl: Ode to Rock 'n Roll". Clues are now posted.<br/>
<br/>
It's been a couple years since we've really gone letterboxing.  It <br/>
was nice to get out and do a little hunting again.  It's <br/>
disappointing when you don't find what you seek, but when you do come <br/>
across what you're looking for it is such a pleasure!  Thanks for <br/>
placing!<br/>
<br/>

Is there a list somewhere of officially mixing boxes? Can we start one<br/>

<br/>
1. Letterboxes were never intended to be forever. I've never heard a planter<br/>
say "I promise this will always be there.". To say that the planter is not<br/>
interested in replacing it is a little harsh. They may be interested, but<br/>
you know what, this is a HOBBY. People have lives. Sometimes they choose not<br/>
to replace, sometimes they just don't have the time right now. <br/>
<br/>
2. Should they take the listing down? Nope, there are people out there who<br/>
love to mark their finds online. I personally am not one of them, but that<br/>
does not stop me from understanding that there are people out there who do.<br/>
If I remove my boxes that are missing, their count gets all messed up.<br/>
Another point is that be leaving the boxes up that are missing, marked<br/>
missing of course, it allows others possible planters to see that a park may<br/>
not be particularly safe. If 7 boxes all go missing in one park, they can<br/>
see that it may not be a good idea to replant in that park. it's a record. <br/>

animosity a suggestion like this stirs up.<br/>
On a more constuctive note, alot of these boxes that go missing and the clues stay posted <br/>
are from newbies who run out plant a few boxes and then decide letterboxing is not thier <br/>
cup of tea. Not to deride newbies we all newbies once. I think all of my first plants are now <br/>
gone, there is a learning curve that goes with it. I now have a few boxes that have been <br/>
out there for over 4 years.<br/>

least they could do is mark that they are missing. (removing them was<br/>
the wrong word and I keep using it and probably will again).  There was<br/>
one box we wanted to go after but the Planter had the decency to mark it<br/>
as gone (that is, if they're still alive and kickin'). <br/>
<br/>
Its still on our list as a place to hit up.  Who knows, maybe some kind<br/>
soul decided to put a replacement box there? Or its a really neat area?<br/>
One box we found to be missing was a perfect spot to hide one... the<br/>
Planter didn't seem interested it replacing it, which is fine, but she<br/>
hasn't bothered to mark it as missing.  Whatever her reason for that, I<br/>
don't know, but that would be best for us that she didn't mark it as<br/>
missing if we decide to place it.<br/>
<br/>
And whoever said that a LB should always have to be there? Stuff<br/>
happens.  Planters have lives, its a hobby, etc.  Its not harsh to say<br/>
they may not be interested in replacing a box.  Its just how the case<br/>
may be for them.<br/>
