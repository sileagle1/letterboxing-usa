Just found out last week at the Molly Day Gathering that a West <br/>
Coast letterboxer named Ryan is just starting out on his first <br/>
attempt to hike the Appalachian Trail, and another one named <br/>
Patrick is currently heading out on the Pacific Crest Trail!  Hurray <br/>
for them!  As a veteran multiple-time "thru-hiker" of both those <br/>
trails (5 AT's/3 PCT's/CDT, plus many others!) and one of that <br/>
still relatively rare breed of "Radical  Repeaters" featured in an <br/>
article by that name in Backpacker magazine about a dozen or <br/>
so years ago, I thought I'd write a few words about long-distance <br/>
backpacking, just in case a few folks might have some <br/>
misconceptions!<br/>
<br/>
 I actually did get asked by a couple of people at "Molly Day" if <br/>
Ryan could possibly get to CT in time for the May 17th "Gerbil <br/>
Gathering"!  Just kind of smiled and shook my head, but - truth <br/>
be told - the only way Ryan could reach CT in one month would <br/>
be if he were backpacking an unheard-of average 50+ miles a <br/>
day or doing an AWFUL lot of "yellow-blazing"!! (i.e. hitchhiking <br/>
into towns and then getting rides to spots up the trail - <br/>
something generally frowned upon by  white-blaze "hiking <br/>
purists"!)  If he stays on the trail and is an average hiker (15-20 <br/>
miles per day), he will probably be just about crossing over into <br/>
southern VA at Damascus around that time! Even to get to the <br/>
very first town that is right on the trail (Wesser,NC at 140 miles) <br/>
always took me about a week, since I was a "purist" and never <br/>
hitchhiked off-trail for supplies or amenities, and about 3 to 4 <br/>
weeks to get to Damascus!  (On my third time through, I did <br/>
manage to backpack all the way to Damascus in less than 3 <br/>
weeks, but that was averaging over 25 miles a day, and not <br/>
many hikers can keep up that kind of pace over that type of <br/>
terrain and in all kinds of weather!)  Doing "big-mile days" on the <br/>
PCT is slightly easier because the trail out there was built with <br/>
more gradual grades, but then you have other things to contend <br/>
with - long distances between water and resupply, extremes in <br/>
weather and elevation ,etc.- but,of course, the Continental Divide <br/>
Trail is still by far the longest and hardest of all, with almost 1000 <br/>
trail miles yet to be built so that hikers won't have to <br/>
cross-country "bushwhack" the way we had to in the past! (Pete <br/>
and I still try to go out as volunteers now to help build a few new <br/>
miles of CDT each summer!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Westerners are frequently surprised by just how rugged <br/>
our eastern mountain trails can be, considering the relatively low <br/>
elevations.  Even some unprepared Easterners, using the AT as <br/>
their intro-level long-distance backpacking experience, <br/>
underestimate the difficulty of the trail. At least nowadays, with <br/>
increased info, better equipment, and many more support <br/>
services, most hikers who reach Damascus (or Wrightwood on <br/>
the PCT) find that they are then able to successfully complete the <br/>
rest of their hikes, so we'll just have to hope that both Ryan and <br/>
Patrick's first few weeks on the trail go well for them! Of course, <br/>
their experience on the trail is apt to be quite different from what <br/>
mine were like in the 80's.  Back then, it seemed like most of us <br/>
hikers were focused on "getting away from civilization", <br/>
communing with nature, and enjoying the hiking itself, only using <br/>
trail towns for quick resupply to head back into the woods! <br/>
Nowadays the focus seems to have shifted-(just as to me it <br/>
seems to have done in letterboxing<br/>
from the "quality of the hike" to the "quality of the stamp"!) to <br/>
viewing the trail as a mere inconvenience to be gotten through <br/>
on the way to getting into town for fast food, showers, and <br/>
computer access!!! (Last year, in fact, while completing my 5th <br/>
AT, I was rather shocked to see cars lined up at formerly fairly <br/>
remote Maine trail crossings, just waiting to take a steady <br/>
stream of well-heeled "thru-hikers" to "B&amp;B's" -good for local <br/>
business, no doubt, but not something my generation of <br/>
backpackers would have taken to, even if it had been available!) <br/>
Ahhh... "the times they are a changin'", but we do wish this <br/>
season's new crop of "first-timers" a wonderful adventure, and <br/>
we'll certainly be interested to see what kind "mileage" they get <br/>
out of their experiences in one way or another!  (Even if Ryan <br/>
were to, say, pull a "Bill Bryson" on us - i.e. hike less than half of <br/>
the trail and then write a funny book about it! - at least we should <br/>
all be able to get some good stories and perhaps a few belly <br/>
laughs out of it!)  So, best of luck, you guys, and hope many more <br/>
adventures await you on the trails!<br/>
