on a small island located at the end of Lake Quonnipaug in North Guilford, <br/>
Connecticut in New Haven County.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From Interstate 95, Exit 58, go north on Route 77. (you will <br/>
cross over Route 80)<br/>
After approximately 6 miles, you will see Lake Quonnipaug on your right.  <br/>
Continue pass the lake until you come to the boat launch with a small parking <br/>
area on your right.<br/>
<br/>
Adventure:  Put your kayak or canoe in at the boat launch and head south.  As <br/>
you are heading south you will see the beach area on your right. The island <br/>
is located approximately 1 mile straight ahead.   On the northeastern side of <br/>
the island is a small area to disembark and pull up your kayak or canoe on to <br/>
the shore.  Proceed 12 paces south to a hollowed out log located upon the <br/>
hill.  The Dragon Fly letterbox is hidden in the middle of the log. <br/>
<br/>
Please be discreet when uncovering and rehinding the letterbox as this area <br/>
can get busy with fisherfold. and other kayakers.  We hope you enjoy your day <br/>
out on the lake as much as we did.<br/>
