<br/>
Dad and I headed out Saturday morning to hit Series II of the East Bay Bike Path.  What a beautiful day with many beautiful views.  Even though I haven't reached the 100 box level yet, I decided to initiate my new stamp.  I saw it and couldn't pass it up.  Hope you all find it as amusing as I did.  <br/>
<br/>
Both the Sightseer and the Handcyclist were in great shape.  Unfortunately it appears that the Fisherman and the Letterboxer had left the trail.  (Maybe they were bored and went to lunch?)  From the other log books it appears that the last visitors there were on September 13.  In fact when we reached the Letterboxers home the rocks were neatly piled as if something should be there, but sadly there was nothing.  <br/>
<br/>
While out there we also did the East Bay Bike Path Letterbox.  Once we read our compass five or six times we finally took the correct reading and found the box intact and dry.  Nice little off path site.  Thanks.  As we headed back to the bike path, Dad suggested taking a shortcut between two paths.  With visions of Psychomommy dancing through my head, I quickly squashed that idea.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone else was able to get out and enjoy the great New England weather this weekend.  Happy Letterboxing.<br/>
