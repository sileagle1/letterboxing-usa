PASSPORT TO THE FALLS LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Hamish MacBeth, Cousin Knuepppe and Adam Ant. <br/>
Date: April 8th, 2003 <br/>
Number of Boxes: Two (other is "A BRIDGE TOO FINGERPRINTED") <br/>
City: Los Angeles <br/>
County: Los Angeles <br/>
State: California <br/>
Place: The Angeles National Forest Picnic Area - Switzer's (other is on the road.) <br/>
Terrain Difficulty: Easy <br/>
Status: Alive <br/>
Note: You do need a FOREST ADVENTURE PASS to park at Switzer Falls. Sorry about this - Cousin Knueppe has purchased a Pass (for $30 for the year, I believe. So if you have one - go for it!) <br/>
1.) Find the Angeles National Forest - I think you can take Highway 2 and you enter from the south-western entrance just off the 210. Check to be sure. <br/>
2.) See the 'Angeles National Forest Picnic Area - Switzer's' sign. Turn right, take the road all the way to the bottom. Park in the parking lot at the beginning of the creek. <br/>
3.) Walk toward the picnic bench, huge boulder and beyond is a foot bridge. Cross it. <br/>
4.) Take note of the signs and follow the trail for Switzer Falls. Keep going along the trail. FOLLOW THE CREEK. At the fork in the road, veer right. (Not toward the outhouse.) <br/>
5.) Keep in the path, there is poison ivy around. There is an opportunity to veer right, you may take this or continue straight - they will meet up. (If you want to be sure - KEEP FOLLOWING THE STREAM.) Go over the rocks. (At any time you can go back to the trail.) <br/>
6.) The path will eventually force you to cross the rocks. The stream forks - take the far one - so the stream is now on your left. There is a tree with a sign on it that says 'TRAIL' with an arrow. <br/>
7.) A little ways up is a small clearing on the right with a huge six trunked tree. Keep going. <br/>
8.) You'll have to cross the creek again so now it's on your right. Keep going. LANDMARKS: On your right will be a stone wall. Ahead are two trees. <br/>
9.) Cross the creek. On the right above is a tree with eight trunks - ahead of you in the middle of the road is a huge boulder. Climb up and stand in the middle of the tree, your back is to the creek. <br/>
10.) You'll see three of the trunks that form two paths. Take the left path. (Between the left trunk and middle.) You will see a big boulder on the right, a flat, blackish boulder in front of you and a couple above that. <br/>
11.) From the center of the tree, go about eight paces forward/up through left path. Now, look to your left - there are movable stones, the letterbox is behind them. (It's about 2-3 paces up and to the left.) Please be careful with the stones and put it back like you found it for the next Letterboxer! <br/>
Be discrete!! <br/>
Happy Hunting!! <br/>
