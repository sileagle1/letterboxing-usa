Placed by : Butterfly with help from Bluebird and Lobsta lady<br/>
Number of boxes : Four [six counting Wanda and Petes]<br/>
Date: MARCH 9 2003<br/>
Where : Montville, CT.<br/>
Rated . Moderate to Easy. One scramble at the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
Directions :South on Rt. 85 from Chesterfield, CT. , pass route 161 on <br/>
the right. Turn left<br/>
onto Turner Road . Travel southeast past New London reservoir on right <br/>
and then Ridge<br/>
Hill Road on left. The entrance is soon on the left with a green bar <br/>
gate. Park carefully .<br/>
Clues :<br/>
 From your car , walk north on an old dirt road and soon take the foot <br/>
trail on the left at<br/>
300 degrees. A stone wall is to the left and the trail is marked with <br/>
blue disks. This is a<br/>
great rocky scramble and as the top grows near you may notice a road and <br/>
stone wall near<br/>
on the left. You cant miss the Glacier Erratic, check it out, and then <br/>
walk 20 more steps<br/>
on the trail to a dead twin tree. Check this out also as the first <br/>
letterbox H is within.!!<br/>
Now watch for the blue disks, as other trails join up here and soon turn <br/>
left with the blue<br/>
- Wanda says 300 degrees and a stonewall to the left --she is right !! <br/>
Also watch on the<br/>
left for the tree you can sit on, and then a rock pile on the right. <br/>
Before passing through<br/>
the stone wall, there is another nice Glacier Erratic on the left. Look <br/>
there for the second<br/>
letterbox A and stamp in. Hide carefully , please. If you have Wanda <br/>
and Petes clues,<br/>
start paying attention !!!More stone walls and stone piles and lovely <br/>
trees. Continue on<br/>
soon descending to the Chaney Ranch foundations. Interesting place !! <br/>
and Wanda keeps<br/>
her cute horse here abouts. Time to continue and go past the bunk house <br/>
. Notice<br/>
several woods roads and save those for another day of adventure. Take <br/>
the smaller trail<br/>
due south as it goes over a wetland area , small streams , maybe dry in <br/>
summer ?? The<br/>
trail goes up and up, easy walking, through stone walls and big trees. <br/>
Come to a junction<br/>
,with a stone wall on left and a Cedar tree on right . The Letterbox <br/>
PPY is in a cairn<br/>
behind the Cedar tree. After stamping in take the trail at 110 degrees <br/>
now on your<br/>
downward homeward bound trail. The stone walls are many and after <br/>
passing several<br/>
watch for a Huge dead Cedar tree on the right. Something awaits you deep <br/>
inside. Stamp<br/>
in and have fun planting it back and cover well. If you come to the <br/>
hairpin turn before<br/>
this box, turn around and go back !!! Follow the woods road back to the <br/>
starting point. I<br/>
hope this has been a Happy Everyday for you.<br/>
