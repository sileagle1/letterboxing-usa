Kinkora Country Inn, <br/>
Kinkora, Prince Edward Island, Canada<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty - easy<br/>
Distance - a stone's throw, but please don't<br/>
Time - drive by.  5 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Planted by "the Family"(Yuzi, CERK, VFTR, butterbaby, spunky spaniel, <br/>
and rtrw) on August 13th, 2002.  All six of us stayed at this <br/>
comfortable and lovely B&amp;B during our vacation on Prince Edward<br/>
Island and enjoyed it tremendously.  We asked for and received <br/>
permission to plant a box in the yard.  The only request was that you <br/>
knock on the door and let them know you're here to look for the <br/>
letterbox before you begin your search.  If no one answers, go look <br/>
for your treasure. These are neat people and it was our pleasure to <br/>
stay with them on our trip.<br/>
<br/>
The History - The original home was built in 1921 by M. J. McIver,<br/>
who came to be known as "the Potato King".  From 1935 to the early <br/>
nineties was a convent. This property also housed the first rural<br/>
high school, which started in 1941 and continued until 1955.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Box - From Route 1, turn onto route 225 and follow that road <br/>
straight to Kinkora.  The Inn will be on your left.  Take the first <br/>
driveway (westernmost entrance in the "U" shape) and stop at the end <br/>
of this side of the driveway.  Please, don't forget to check in at<br/>
the front door before searching.  As you come down the front steps <br/>
turn right and head in a westerly direction toward the first cedar <br/>
tree.  Your prize lies below its branches waiting to be found.  The <br/>
Spaniel, who recently turned 14, conceived and drew the stamp. <br/>
Didn't she do a nice job?  Since we are from 9-15 hours drive away <br/>
from PEI, please keep an eye on our box for us.  We'd be happy to pay <br/>
for replacements as needed.  Please send any info to rtrw@attbi.com.  <br/>
Thanks.  Enjoy. <br/>
