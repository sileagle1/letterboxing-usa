I checked on the boxes at the other two forts and they are fine. Lone <br/>
Wolf has been the only one at Ticonderoga, and no one has yet <br/>
stamped the box at Crown Point.<br/>

When you add up all the Forwards, Rights, Lefts, and Abouts, relative <br/>
to your original bearing of 6 degrees, the Forwards and Backs cancel <br/>
out, and you have 166 paces in the Left Face orientation, i.e. 276 <br/>
degrees.<br/>
<br/>
Pacing this off from the flagpole takes you to the second stone <br/>
ledge on the parade ground, just before the ruins at the opposite <br/>
end. The box is in a cleft in the ledge, behind a small stone that <br/>
covers the cleft.<br/>
