want to give it up.<br/>

Knights of Colombo,  Please add the following paragraph to "It's a <br/>
Holiday" after "... good hike." and before "Please be discreet..."  <br/>
And could you send the url to the VA Webmaster so he can now list <br/>
it?  Which I think is: http://wildwinds.tripod.com/tdg.html#holiday<br/>
<br/>
It's now long after Christmas but who wants to let go of the <br/>
holidays.  Now when you look down at the food court below, the <br/>
Christmas tree is gone; instead you are looking at the center of an <br/>
octagonal tile pattern.  But hey, there is always another holiday <br/>
coming up.  I have made "It's a Holiday" a seasonal box with changing <br/>
stamps.  I placed a new stamp and replaced the old full log.  Now <br/>
showing: "It's a Holiday 2: the Royal French Court Fashion Valentine."<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting,<br/>
