                    <div class="plaintext-content">The year has been good to our tropical letterboxes. I managed to run up the<br/>
mountains of Oahu in my spare time to track down the Silent Sentinel and<br/>
the Lanikai Bunkers letterboxes, both in place. I'm also pleased to report<br/>
that despite Lonemasswolf's claims that it's missing, the 'I'iwi letterbox<br/>
is peacefully awaiting visitors, nestled between butress and bamboo. An<br/>
intrepid couple from FL have placed the only stamps in its log, so far.<br/>
<br/>
Next, it was on to Maui where we found half a day to trek across lava, have<br/>
a picnic at a hidden beach and to check on the King's Highway letterbox. My<br/>
newly initiated friend, Fonz, was amazingly persistent in searching for<br/>
this box. I chuckled as he turned over at least a million rocks, some<br/>
within a foot of the box, before meeting with success. The clue is a bit<br/>
ambiguous but several visitors  have braved the lava and left their mark in<br/>
the log, the most recent being a couple from Canada, pushing 70 years old.<br/>
<br/>
I have left new boxes in my wake on both islands. The clues will find their<br/>
way to the List soon. Aloha, Funhog<br/>
