they were alright after Saturday's feeding frenzy.  A few were <br/>
exposed to passersby so I made sure that they were well covered and <br/>
out of view.  One box I came across was completely exposed (Feets <br/>
the Clown) and I think it might have been an animal that uncovered <br/>
it.  I hid it deeper under its home and added many LARGE chunks of <br/>
bark and wood to make its nest much more secure and completely out <br/>
of sight.   A couple other boxes had some partial exposure which we <br/>
repaired and as of of 1500 hours today all boxes were in great shape <br/>
and well visited!!!<br/>
<br/>
See you on future trails...  ;)<br/>
