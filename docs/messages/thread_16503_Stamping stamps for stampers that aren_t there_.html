<br/>
What do you do when someone is willing to take a sig stamp in an exchange from a letterboxer who can not attend an event, but refuses to stamp into that persons log book?<br/>
<br/>
In other words, if we had a logbook and personal stamp from a friend who could not make it to the event, should someone take their stamp and refuse to stamp the log book?<br/>
<br/>
I realize this is more a moral issue than anything else as there are no rules but the unwritten ones, however, I wanted to know what the consensus of the group is.<br/>

Hypothetically speaking:<br/>
You mean if you had your friend's stamp &amp; book and I wanted to have<br/>
this friends stamp in MY book but then refused to stamp back in<br/>
return?  Well that's kinda mean. If the deed is done there isn't much<br/>
you could do unless you somehow managed to shame me into making the<br/>
return stamp.  Ask *why* I would take the stamp but not return, and<br/>
then stand there looking at me with an expectant look on your face<br/>
(that one's sure to get me).  Getting silly here, you could grab my<br/>
log book and hold it hostage until I made the return stamp (this could<br/>
be a fun revert to childhood thing).  You could make a loud fuss so<br/>
everyone nearby knows what I did.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if any of this helps.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings Everyone <br/>
<br/>
I'm going to pipe my two cents in here just to prove that one <br/>
person's perception of something is not always the case or how <br/>
something really is.<br/>
<br/>
First let me give my not so humble opinion about Exchanges.  An <br/>
exchange is defined in the dictionary as follows - To give in return <br/>
for something received; trade:.  That exchange in my opinion takes <br/>
two people.  Will I do an exchange with someone that is not present <br/>
at an event? Absolutely not.  No more than I will take an image that <br/>
someone else has found and call it a find.  I didn't find it, and in <br/>
this case, I didn't exchange with that person either.  <br/>
<br/>
But I am going to take this a little farther.  Guess what, I am one <br/>
of those horrible people that had a stamp in my logbook from someone <br/>
that was not at the event and whose logbook I refused, yes refused to <br/>
stamp into.  But before everyone jumps up and down let me explain how <br/>
strange things happen sometimes.  So here I was at my first ever-<br/>
stamping event, and there are a couple people there I know very <br/>
well.  We are all sitting at the table doing exchanges and I give my <br/>
book and get theirs in return.  It gets confusing sometimes with a <br/>
lot of people at an event.  Especially when you have Teams that are <br/>
represented by one stamp.  So in passing things around and exchanging <br/>
someone stamps into my book and at the same time does an absentee <br/>
stamp into my book for a friend of theirs.  I had no idea at the <br/>
time.  When the absentee book was handed to me to stamp into I <br/>
refused based on the above stated opinion.  I didn't even realize at <br/>
this point I had the other persons stamp yet.  I always stamp my <br/>
images on a separate piece of paper and they tape into my logbook, <br/>
it's the anal retentive neat freak in me.  So I get home, move the <br/>
images into my book and I am a bit confused and puzzled as to whom <br/>
this one stamp belongs too.  I write the email address down beside it <br/>
and leave it at that.  But my being over compulsive, I just had to <br/>
figure out who it was.  So I sat down and went over everyone at the <br/>
event, the stamps I had, and realized there was no face to match this <br/>
stamp.  Then it dawned on me what had happened.  Okay so now what do <br/>
I do? Do I take it out of my book after it's been taped in? Do I X <br/>
out the stamp?  Nope I don't want to ruin my logbook or deface <br/>
someone's signature stamp.  Instead I just take a blank piece of <br/>
paper over it and pretend it never happened.  <br/>
<br/>
Was I evil and bad for taking a stamp I didn't exchange for? Nope.  I <br/>
think my only fault was that I was not more organized and paying <br/>
closer attention to what was going on.  But I don't have the image in <br/>
my logbook, nor did I count it as an exchange so no harm to foul. <br/>
<br/>
Personally and I realize it is a moral and ethical thing, but <br/>
personally I think it is wrong to send your log book along with <br/>
someone to an event you can't attend. I think it is wrong to take a <br/>
logbook with you to an event for someone that can't attend.  <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, and this is just my opinion, I think it is sort of silly to <br/>
even make a big deal about whether or not someone does an exchange or <br/>
stamps into your book, a box, whatever, personally my signature stamp <br/>
is my signature stamp, I will put it where I want too, be that in a <br/>
logbook, on a website, or stamped on my forehead as a name tag.  <br/>
There are a lot of ways to do things, count things and view things, <br/>
but when it comes to signature stamps, in my opinion, anything they <br/>
do with it is up to that person on an individual level.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that several issues in letterboxing are moral and <br/>
ethical, Iron`Bear doesn't keep a log book for example, no FPX <br/>
counts, no images, he stamps into them, but doesn't keep his own, he <br/>
doesn't need proof of where he has been or what he has done, he knows <br/>
it himself and for the most part our log books would be identical.  <br/>
For the most part. But there are stamps I have planted without him, <br/>
found without him, and would he count those as his own finds as well? <br/>
No he wouldn't.  So what happens when a team only keeps one logbook <br/>
and the whole team is not present for a FPX?  Such a thing would keep <br/>
me from doing a Team logbook, however I know several teams that do <br/>
it.    So what do you all think about that?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Pandora, I'm inclined to agree with your 'essay' on stamping in.  I have only <br/>
once stamped someone into a box when they were not present and that was my <br/>
son who was probably taking care of 'personal business' on the trail and just <br/>
didn't walk to the box with me.  <br/>
It does get crazy at gatherings with exchanges and I have sometimes doubled <br/>
up on people or missed some that I may or may not have stamped into their log <br/>
books.  <br/>
It doesn't matter to me as long as PFX counts aren't what 'make' a <br/>
letterboxer.  Here in CT we have so many boxes to find it is easy to accumulate numbers. <br/>
 That doesn't make us better boxers than those who have less choices in their <br/>
areas.  (I literally tripped over a box when I was out on Monday-no clues, <br/>
and it was next to the box I was looking for!)<br/>
I think each of us needs to be true to our own view of PFX and let others do <br/>
the same.<br/>
Thanks for the opinion and sparking discussion.<br/>

<br/>
But I'm not asking about stamping them into a letterbox they didn't find, heavens no. There's NO way I would stamp anyone other than my Teams sig stamp at a box I found. I was referring to exchange stamps and I am sorry I wasn't clear on that part.<br/>
<br/>
I'm asking if someone who can not make it to an event or gathering, if their logbook was there, would you stamp into it, do an 'exchange'?  Would your answer change depending on the reason that they couldn't be there?<br/>

<br/>
My earlier post was not a "confession" -- it was nothing more than my <br/>
sharing an experience to make a point.  That point being that <br/>
sometimes what we think is going on is not really what went on or <br/>
what happened...  The reactions from the group to this thread implied <br/>
that someone must be pretty selfish to take a stamp and refuse to <br/>
give one.... I thought I would share an example that showed how it <br/>
could happen in a very innocent and unintentional way...<br/>
<br/>
Lead by example they say ... I think they are wrong though, if this <br/>
list is teaching me one thing fast its to keep your mouth shut.<br/>

Just my opinion, but personally if I can't make it to the gathering<br/>
my log book and sig stamp would not be there either. I think<br/>
people should only get the stamps if they have made it a priority to<br/>
be there in person. If that's how it works, you could have a ton of<br/>
log books and no people there, (just stamp the stamps in my book and<br/>
send it back to me!!) I would not feel right getting stamps for no <br/>
effort put<br/>
forth towards me!!!! I understand you are just talking about the <br/>
event stamps, but.... that is like giving another LBer my logbook<br/>
while they go out on a LB day and have them get the stamps for me<br/>
that they find! No sorry, just doesn't seem right to me, a gathering<br/>
is a gathering to meet other Lbers, not just to get the stamps. You<br/>
get the special event stamps and the roving stamps in your book for<br/>
being at the gathering, not having your book at the gathering. I<br/>
really don't think I would stamp in a log book at the gathering if<br/>
the log book not the person was there, no matter what the excuse. <br/>
There will be other gatherings!! Hope I have explained my<br/>
point.<br/>
Just my 2 cents,...... I, nor my logbook will be able to make it!!!!!<br/>

to my peers to get your feelings, not Pandora's confession.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry to say, that if I felt what she did was wrong or immoral, <br/>
I'd have at least had the intestinal fortitude to talk to her <br/>
privately about it and not bring it up in a public forum.<br/>

the exchange doesn't take place.<br/>

&gt;   Well, I have to say that what I was thinking when I read the <br/>
original<br/>
&gt;   post was that it was either 1) a hypothetical discussion being <br/>
tossed<br/>
&gt;   around or 2) a potential situation being discussed that no-one <br/>
could<br/>
&gt;   agree on.  I see neither of my theories were correct.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Pandora, I think under the circumstances what you did was the <br/>
right<br/>
&gt;   thing.<br/>
