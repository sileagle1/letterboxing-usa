your pack?  I'm going to guess the boogie man will not wait if you <br/>
say "hold on and let me rifle through my pack for my pepper spray".  <br/>
Look for a can that can be perhaps lashed to the chest strap of your <br/>
pack for easy use ?     <br/>
<br/>
Avoid the need for it by not going alone....<br/>
<br/>
And if you still want to buy it try the local Army/Navy store. Also <br/>
try galls.com (public safety supplier). Beware that most canisters of <br/>
pepper spray do have expirations. And also, it tastes pretty good on <br/>
hot dogs : ) <br/>

<br/>
Here in MA you need a special firearms ID from the police department to carry <br/>
pepper spray....basically to prove you know how to use it.<br/>
<br/>
Also be very careful about accidental release of pepper spray. I once had a <br/>
canister that must have had some residue on it from being jostled around in my <br/>
bag (I would take it out and carry it when hiking or walking at night in <br/>
college. I was lucky not to have had too bad a reaction, but whew! I don't <br/>
recommend experiencing pepper spray (not even a few molecules of it!) if you can help <br/>
it.<br/>

Stay safe!<br/>

It's interesting to hear the discussion about pepper spray from the Lower 48. <br/>
 Here in AK, I carry it (sometimes and in certain places) for bear <br/>
protection, not for worrying about people.  On many of the trails I walk with my kids we <br/>
don't see any other people.  But if it's a long hike in a bear-frequented <br/>
area and my husband isn't with me, I certainly want pepper spray with me in case <br/>
it turns out to be the only thing that deters a bear from eating my kids!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and the pepper spray we get here comes with a holster that you can attach <br/>
to the waist strap of your backpack, or on a belt.  And you don't have to <br/>
have a license or anything to carry it...<br/>
