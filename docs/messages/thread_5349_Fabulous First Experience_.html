<br/>
Just had to share what a wonderful first experience my sister and I, along <br/>
with our families, had as first time letterboxers.  We visited the Beaver <br/>
Lake Nature Center in Central NY, really enjoyed the afternoon in the park <br/>
and, after a false start due to over eagerness, found all three boxes <br/>
placed by St. George!  My brother-in-law, a big and burly no-nonsense kind <br/>
of guy with an artistic side is now talking about carving a series of <br/>
stamps and just bought a carving kit.  My 14 year old son, the skeptic, was <br/>
the first to locate the first box we searched for, and was hooked!  We <br/>
thought we were pretty discreet, but realized later that other letterboxers <br/>
could probably have spotted us a mile away, with our 6 different <br/>
kaleidacolor ink pads showing through our translucent plastic grocery bag <br/>
and our ink stained fingers.  We are avid (rabid?) rubber stampers, so we <br/>
had trouble narrowing down what to take - glad we had reviewed lots of <br/>
posts to this list and brought paper towels to clean the stamps before and <br/>
after using them.  Looking through the box journals, seeing other's stamps <br/>
and reading the comments was also lots of fun.<br/>
<br/>
We went home tired but happy and are planning our next outing - and we're <br/>
quite pleased with our F count of 3!.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
