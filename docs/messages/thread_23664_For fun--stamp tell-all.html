                    <div class="plaintext-content">Some questions that I've been curious about since I first heard of letterboxing, and my responses.  Feel free to reply with your own responses.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Do you hand-carve your own?  Yes.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Did you carve a stamp after becoming interested in letterboxing, or were you already a stamp carver before you ever heard of the game? Carving came first, a decade or so ago; letterboxing followed a couple of years later.  It has taken me years to make space to try letterboxing--not to mention to find letterboxes in my area.<br/>
<br/>
3.  How did you decide on the image on your main signature stamp?  Because I have teenboys, we started with geocaching, which appeals to them more.  A friend who runs a gradeschool caching club told me about the little pottery rocks she leaves in caches--glazed and with neat words like "imagine" or "grow" imprinted in them--as a signature trade item.  The kids and I wanted a signature of our own, something handmade, not too involved, but that looked really good.  We stumbled on some embroidered bugs in a craft book and knew we'd found it--not too hard, really awesome-looking, and sort of offbeat, like us.  Plus, buggy for my boys and shiny for my girl (we use iridescent flosses).  When we decided to add a letterbox or two to our hunts, a bug sig stamp seemed like the perfect thing.  The stamp itself has yet to be designed or carved, but I'll get to it in the next few days.<br/>
<br/>
4.   How did your first carving experiences go?  I carved my first stamps in amber-yellow gum erasers--very crumbly--and Pink Pearls.  I still have some of those.  Most are pretty rough.  Around my fifth stamp, I used a Mars eraser and carved a formal, stylized floral that still leaves me feeling amazed at myself.  Nothing since has quite measured up, though I've been carving for years!<br/>
<br/>
5.  What's a favorite image you've carved?  The floral, above.  I also have a little Halloweenish cat stamp I like.  And I carved my own fake mail-cancellation stamp to use on mail art envelopes.  Little squiggly cancellation lines, "mejaka mail" in a circle, pine trees.  I like to use red ink with that one.<br/>
<br/>
6.  How many stamps have you carved exclusively for use in letterboxing?  By the end of this week, there will be one...<br/>

<br/>
Yes I do because I enjoy the process.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Did you carve a stamp after becoming interested in letterboxing, or were you already a stamp carver before you ever heard of the game?<br/>
Carving came first (in the mid 1990s), while I was learning about rubberstamping I found out about carving.  I got a lot of my inspiration from Tabloid Trash, Rusty Clark's site (now defunct). Learned about letterboxing via Carving Consortium.<br/>
<br/>
3.  How did you decide on the image on your main signature stamp? <br/>
My signature stamp has changed over the years. It was a word quote one year, a cartoon image of my poodle the next year, an exact replica of my geocaching sticker another year, now it is reflects my letterboxing trailname.<br/>
<br/>
 4.   How did your first carving experiences go? <br/>
<br/>
The Carving Consortium group suggested white erasers, so that's what I started using and continue to use for the most part.  But most erasers are on the small side so I also use Nasco Safety-Kut (another Carving Consortium suggestion) because Safety Kut comes in different sizes and I can buy it online and have it shipped to me. I buy the postcard size and cut out what I need. I started carving with a hobby blade and did OK with it but moved on to linoleum cutters and continue to use those.<br/>
<br/>
 5.  What's a favorite image you've carved? <br/>
<br/>
Dogs - all kinds.<br/>
<br/>
 6.  How many stamps have you carved exclusively for use in letterboxing?<br/>
I carve stamps for both my real letterboxes and virtual letterboxes, so far I've carved over 72 just for letterboxes (a few I've had to carve again to replace missing boxes).._,___<br/>

&gt; 2.  Did you carve a stamp after becoming interested in <br/>
letterboxing, or were you already a stamp carver before you ever <br/>

second!  I found that carving stamps and hiding boxes is as much or <br/>
more fun than finding them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3.  How did you decide on the image on your main signature stamp?  <br/>
&gt; I chose my trail name from my first love, quilting. My favorite <br/>
quilting block pattern is called Wild Goose Chase.  I thought that <br/>
looking for letterboxes sounded like a perfectly fun wild goose <br/>
chase to me, and I have a history of taking my sisters and my Girl <br/>
Scouts on wild goose chases, so...how perfect.  I'm Goose Chaser.  <br/>
My first signature stamp was the quilt block, wild goose chase.  <br/>
But, it's gone through a metamorphesis since then.  I love my little <br/>
wild goose stamp that runs across the page.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 4.   How did your first carving experiences go?  First was my <br/>
first signature stamp, on a pink eraser. It went pretty well. Second <br/>
went well except for those backward letters!  Oops.  Lesson in <br/>
reverse learned.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5.  What's a favorite image you've carved?  Hmm, tough question, <br/>
probably the one I carved with my puppy's face.  It looks just like <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 6.  How many stamps have you carved exclusively for use in <br/>
letterboxing?  24, I think, but not all are hiding yet.    <br/>

<br/>
     Some questions that I've been curious about since I first heard of letterboxing, and my responses. Feel free to reply with your own responses.<br/>
<br/>
 1. Do you hand-carve your own? <br/>
<br/>
  Yes, that's half of the game.<br/>
<br/>
 2. Did you carve a stamp after becoming interested in letterboxing, or were you already a stamp carver before you ever heard of the game? <br/>
<br/>
   I wasn't aware of the material until I visted the web sites. I carved wooden whirlygigs and other things before and use only wood backings on all of my stamps. I made my stamp in March before I found my first box.<br/>
<br/>
   3. How did you decide on the image on your main signature stamp? <br/>
<br/>
 Back in March I made a large stamp for use until I ran into microboxes and realized that the suggested size of 2 1/2 inches square for stamps was too large. So I found Wild Willy in the clip art and carved a nice replica of better size.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 4. How did your first carving experiences go? <br/>
<br/>
  Carving was easy, my lack of a good subject was the problem. By the third stamp, I was a-ok. <br/>
<br/>
 5. What's a favorite image you've carved? <br/>
<br/>
  I made some nice presidental portraits. I was inspired by the 'Sherman' box stamp and went after that style along with the coloring book style.<br/>
<br/>
 6. How many stamps have you carved exclusively for use in letterboxing? <br/>
  I have 29 planted boxes with almost that many carved and riding around in my truck all Summer. <br/>

Some questions that I've been curious about since I first heard of letterboxing, and my responses. Feel free to reply with your own responses.<br/>
<br/>
1. Do you hand-carve your own? <br/>
For the most part yes. About 90% of them are hand-carved by me and the other 10%, store bought.<br/>
<br/>
2. Did you carve a stamp after becoming interested in letterboxing, or were you already a stamp carver before you ever heard of the game? <br/>
I had no idea you could carve a stamp yourself until after we got involved with letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
3. How did you decide on the image on your main signature stamp? <br/>
The main image for my signature stamp is a Nittany Lion. Go Penn State! Living in New Hamphire, we have some mountian lions up here i'm sure, so it seemed like a wonderful match.<br/>
<br/>
4. How did your first carving experiences go? <br/>
Well, my first stamp was made out of a eraser. I used an xacto knife. After a few stamps that way, I was introduced to Speedball and Mastercarve.<br/>
<br/>
5. What's a favorite image you've carved? <br/>
So far, as of 8/8/06, my favorite stamp would have to be Portsmouth Alarm. It is a stamp carved from a painting of Paul Revere's ride. I would suggest everyone to visit the box and see the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
6. How many stamps have you carved exclusively for use in letterboxing? <br/>
I have i think 40 planted and another 12 looking for a home.<br/>

Speedball linoleum carving tools; Mastercarve carving medium.  These are the tools and media most used by people who carve their own stamps as an art form in itself.   Other media are Safety-Cut (cheaper but less fine-grained) and the pink Speedball medium which seems to be of equally fine grain and a bit cheaper--I just got my first bit of it.<br/>

<br/>
  Some questions that I've been curious about since I first heard of letterboxing, and my responses. Feel free to reply with your own responses.<br/>
<br/>
  1. Do you hand-carve your own? <br/>
  For the most part yes. About 90% of them are hand-carved by me and the other 10%, store bought.<br/>
<br/>
  2. Did you carve a stamp after becoming interested in letterboxing, or were you already a stamp carver before you ever heard of the game? <br/>
  I had no idea you could carve a stamp yourself until after we got involved with letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
  3. How did you decide on the image on your main signature stamp? <br/>
  The main image for my signature stamp is a Nittany Lion. Go Penn State! Living in New Hamphire, we have some mountian lions up here i'm sure, so it seemed like a wonderful match.<br/>
<br/>
  4. How did your first carving experiences go? <br/>
  Well, my first stamp was made out of a eraser. I used an xacto knife. After a few stamps that way, I was introduced to Speedball and Mastercarve.<br/>
<br/>
  5. What's a favorite image you've carved? <br/>
  So far, as of 8/8/06, my favorite stamp would have to be Portsmouth Alarm. It is a stamp carved from a painting of Paul Revere's ride. I would suggest everyone to visit the box and see the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
  6. How many stamps have you carved exclusively for use in letterboxing? <br/>
  I have i think 40 planted and another 12 looking for a home.<br/>
