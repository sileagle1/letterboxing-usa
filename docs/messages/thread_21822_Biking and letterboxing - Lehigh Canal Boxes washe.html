In the past I may have recommeded the three from Space Traveler <br/>
along the Lehigh Canal Towpath in the Bethlehem, PA Area.  However, <br/>
the floods from the past couple major storms (Ivan last September <br/>
and the floods we had on April 2-4 this year) absolutely washed them <br/>
away.  Both hiding places were there, but definately below the <br/>
waterline and eroded.  Alas, perhaps somebody downriver from there <br/>
may be more lucky than me and my mountain bike!<br/>

&gt; Hi to all in LB land,<br/>
&gt; 	 We are packing up and bringing "The Budster" with us to the <br/>
Cape<br/>
&gt; Henlopen State Park area in Delaware in a few weeks to explore.  <br/>
We will<br/>
&gt; bring our "Ride and Stride" to pull Bud to the various places with <br/>
our<br/>
&gt; bikes to hunt down LB's weather permitting.<br/>
&gt; 	This old laptop is going along for the ride too. Got a <br/>
wireless card for<br/>
&gt; it so maybe there will be  some wireless service along the way so <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; the LB site can be readily available.  Even if it can't hookup it <br/>
will be<br/>
&gt; useful to jot down  notes about our searches.<br/>
&gt; 	So along with my LB kit we will have other fun things too. <br/>
Kites , high<br/>
&gt; power glasses , star charts ,treasure &amp; locator detectors and lots <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; snacks.  Ol'Roys for Bud. <br/>
&gt; 	On or way down  around Cape May we will need to find some <br/>
place that<br/>
&gt; allows dogs for a stay over point before <br/>
&gt; we continue the next day over to the ferryrude to  Delaware. <br/>
&gt; 	<br/>
&gt; 	Hope to find some good riding trails for our bikes and maybe <br/>
there will<br/>
&gt; be letterboxes along the way!  <br/>
&gt; 	<br/>
&gt; 	We need more biking letterboxes!  <br/>
