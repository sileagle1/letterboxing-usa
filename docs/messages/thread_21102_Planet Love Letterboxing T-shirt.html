The Highlander works at a company that shares space with a t-shirt <br/>
company called Planet Love Designs. They have a 50% Customer <br/>
appreciation day for the employees every year and this year, he got <br/>
me a shirt that I thought you'd all really like. Click on the link <br/>
below and scroll down to the pic of Hiker Mocha...looks just like a <br/>
letterboxer! It's a nice sturdy shirt that I won't be worried about <br/>
getting dirt on (since it's mocha) and they're extremely comfortable. <br/>
They're a very small and friendly company, so I'm sure they won't <br/>
mind this little plug...check them out!<br/>

I don't thinks think anyone intended to make a sales pitch.  My impression is they were only tying to let us all know of the nice shirt that looks like a letterboxer.  I thought it was a nice idea.  <br/>

I didn't really see it as offensive, since this is NOT a plug from <br/>
the company itself (in fact, they don't even KNOW I wrote about them, <br/>
let alone know anything about letterboxing). I've seen items posted <br/>
here before like chairs and such, so I didn't see this as any <br/>
different. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the misunderstanding!<br/>

Just to let you know, not everyone agrees with Don. <br/>
:)Personally, I enjoyed looking at the T-Shirt designs, <br/>
especially the one with the hiker. The woodcut look of the <br/>
designs is a lot like letterbox designs. You're biggest <br/>
danger is that someone will use one of the designs as <br/>
"inspiration" to make a letterbox! Although I've been <br/>
known to bend copyright rules, I wouldn't without the <br/>
companies permission. :P<br/>

<br/>
Not taken as such - no worries.<br/>
i did like the graphics very much, in fact - they really had an almost stamp-carved <br/>
appeal to them. I think that gift suggestions are well within the realm of conversation <br/>
topics on this list - especially when they relate to the outdoors. It's one thing to <br/>
advertise one's own webpage however, it's another thing entirely if you're just <br/>
suggestive out of pure enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
You know, it wasn't too long ago that this letterboxing site was recruiting a person to <br/>
come up with logo ideas, now patches are made out of the generosity of those few <br/>
that take initiative and there are many others that contribute to the positive image of <br/>
letterboxing in and out of the spotlight. I'm not here to name names, but negativity <br/>
doesn't make anyone look good.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers to all!<br/>

I'm sure most of us realized right away that this wasn't a sales pitch. <br/>
But, I have to say that it came as a great time because the Orienteering <br/>
club to which I belong has been discussing having t-shirts made, with a <br/>
locally designed logo, for its members.  I think I'll pass this along to <br/>
the team that's looking into it. So, regardless of how others might <br/>
interpret your intentions, I thank you for this posting.<br/>

Lighten up will  ya.<br/>
I don't thinks think anyone intended to make a sales pitch.  My impression is they were only tying to let us all know of the nice shirt that looks like a letterboxer.  I thought it was a nice idea.  <br/>

I didn't really see it as offensive, since this is NOT a plug from <br/>
the company itself (in fact, they don't even KNOW I wrote about them, <br/>
let alone know anything about letterboxing). I've seen items posted <br/>
here before like chairs and such, so I didn't see this as any <br/>
different. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the misunderstanding!<br/>

Agree or not, that wasn't the reason I sent the post. This list <br/>
should be about letterboxing. We have several folks that are into <br/>
letterboxing and also sell apparel, and other notions that are <br/>
created for the letterboxer on other sites,should they also send in <br/>
a note? Regardless of good intentions, I just feel that this sort of <br/>
thing is out of place and can get out of hand and abused. Obviously <br/>
several others see no problem with touting someones website and <br/>
products on this list, well I don't believe that is what it was <br/>
created for. Where does it stop? If this promotion is good, then <br/>
what about the next one, and what criteria is used to separate the <br/>
good sales promotions from the onerous?<br/>

<br/>
To my recollection, this was just a suggestion as to a design that *clearly* envoked <br/>
the adventurous spirit and enthusiasm that (most) folks on this list and who are <br/>
involved in letterboxing share for this hobby. Whether or not you choose to support a <br/>
company, a brand, a webpage or even read the email is your choice. In a world where <br/>
we are bombarded by subliminal yahoo ads supporting the gas-guzzling-road-<br/>
whore-image that really doesn't fit with our back-to-nature spirit, perhaps you ought <br/>
to ask yourself, is there not a better forum for you to express your opinions with <br/>
others?<br/>
<br/>
The choice is simple to me, voice your opinion but choose not to support something <br/>
through your actions and purchasing power. Only consumers have the power and <br/>
responsibility to take action. The promoters and companies that are out there to <br/>
exploit are just like the big wheels of the machine. They'll keep on turning.<br/>

Folks, remember that we can sometimes (or often) disagree.  That's a <br/>
good way to promote discussion and learning, but please let's not let <br/>
it turn personal.  Just because you don't like what someone says <br/>
doesn't mean there aren't others who agree with the statements or <br/>
that we should jump at them personally.<br/>
