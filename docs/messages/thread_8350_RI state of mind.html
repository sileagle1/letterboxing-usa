                    <html><body>There's something about Rhode Island. Rhode Islanders know it, and some of them make fun of it (www.quahog.org) but we've been in love there, had children there, and think we understand it. It's an Ocean State: the rain falls there like anywhere else but you don't feel wet. Go to Billions and Billions of Blue Barnacles in a scudding blow, past that lonely scattering of weather beaten beach houses near a "sweet" water pond and you'll understand, too. Or go to a Gathering of letterboxers and frenzy in stamp images (I was blue ink to the wrist). Same Rhode Island thing.
<br/>
<br/>The soft, persistent soaking that was more wet atmosphere than distinguished rainfall pulled folks together under shelter like a common interest.
<br/>
<br/>Tom N, you're a genius! Karen, well met and hope to see you this spring at a Gathering near you. I'm hoping to convince Tom Someone to make the trip. To our Gathered friends, new and old who came and gave such pleasure in your company, forget about that whole Pole Shift thing! Rhode Island will last forever.
