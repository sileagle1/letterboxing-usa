I am VERY EXCITED to offer this series! It has been great practice<br/>
for me to get out there and plant more boxes (my first box<br/>
disappearing so quickly kinda put a damper on that "planting part"<br/>
of my soul!). I've also tried to use several different "elements"<br/>
including a micro-box, a piggy-back box, a hitchhiker, etc. I've<br/>
tried to make the boxes easy to find, but did want to try writing a<br/>
few more cryptic clues. The stamps are all very lovely (thanks to<br/>
much help from NorthStars family...I just KNEW I was gonna be glad<br/>
that I introduced them to lboxing!).<br/>
<br/>
And...my kiddos are just DYING to start giving away boxes of Girl<br/>
Scout cookies! (My daughter's goal this year is to sell 1,000 boxes<br/>
of cookies and use her Cookie Credits to go to Brownie Camp this<br/>
summer for a whole entire week without her mother! Imagine that!)<br/>
We will also have more cookies available for you to purchase if you<br/>
are interested...our council charges $3.00 per box. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you come down to complete the series, please consider hiding a<br/>
box in our area. I know that we would be happy to "adopt" or help<br/>
you maintain any boxes in our neck of the woods.<br/>
