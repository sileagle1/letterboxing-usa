I dont know if this has been brought up before-I'm new-but  the  stamp pad i <br/>
bought came with an ink roller.  I carry that in my kit  and if i come across <br/>
a dried out stamp pad in a letter box, i will re-ink  for the placer. Just a <br/>
little nicey-nice I can do for others!<br/>

&gt; Is is always proper to place an ink pad in each  box?<br/>
<br/>
The vast majority of letterboxes do not have ink pads.   It does seem <br/>
to be more common out east, but it's VERY rare to find  ink pads in a <br/>
letterbox out west.  And even those that have ink  pads--it's still a <br/>
good idea for a letterboxer to carry their own  supply since the one <br/>
<br/>
in the box might be frozen (in the depths  of winter) or waterlogged <br/>
or any other number of problems.  Or  maybe the ink just plain ran <br/>
out.  Letterboxers should always  carry ink pads with them, and <br/>
letterboxes never need to have them at  all.  =)<br/>
