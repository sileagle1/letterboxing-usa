   We were poking around on the CT DEP webpage the other day and <br/>
found that many of the trail maps for the state parks and forests are <br/>
being revised and/or updated. Many are now in nice colored versions <br/>
with hiking distances, etc noted. You may want to pick one up for <br/>
areas such as Talcott Mtn, Bigelow Hollow, Sleeping Giant, etc. <br/>
<br/>
  To access these try www.dep.state.ct.us   then find <br/>
the "Recreation" link. Clicking on the "Outdoor rec" area brings you <br/>
into state parks / forests.   Its a pretty useful tool!<br/>
