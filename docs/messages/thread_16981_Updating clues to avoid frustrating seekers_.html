                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's good to hear from Webmaster Jay Drew that the "unclaimed-<br/>
letterbox" problem is being addressed by adoptions and by retaining <br/>
older clues in a separate file.  I'm sure that many have hesitated to <br/>
expend much effort on searching for them.  One way that I have just <br/>
started dealing with this in my own boxes, and those maintained for <br/>
others, is to add to the clues the statement "Verified in place, <br/>
(date)".  Fortunately, a well-hidden box in a secure container may <br/>
stay healthy for a long time.  Our Garden of the Gods LB in southern <br/>
IL did so for 2 years without maintenance, and my oldest local box <br/>
locally (Sugar Hill in western and central NY) has also been in place <br/>
2 years.  The latter, tho, has had periodic visits and a couple of <br/>
times been discovered not tightly closed and with some moisture in <br/>
the box.  And I've had a couple of boxes disappear entirely.  So, <br/>
things to happen to them, and maintenance - perhaps twice a year - is <br/>
strongly urged.<br/>
