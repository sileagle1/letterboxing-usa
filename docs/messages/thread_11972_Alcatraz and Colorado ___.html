                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey Petal,  I'm a new LB'er from Colorado as well.  I haven't been in search<br/>
of anything here at home yet.  Just a note to all, though - just got back<br/>
from San Francisco, and am happy to report that The Rock (Alcatraz Island)<br/>
is intact!  This is a fun tour, and a great box - love the clues!<br/>
<br/>
Also, we spent about two hours searching for Ruth's Hybrid.  Either this<br/>
puppy is gone, or we were in the totally wrong spot.  Has anyone found this<br/>
box?<br/>
<br/>
Question from a newbie to the list ... There seems to be no way through the<br/>
LBNA site to contact the box placer to notify them about your finds.  Am I<br/>
missing something?  Do I just post that here?  And is there a way to search<br/>
this site for new boxes and notices about boxes in my area that aren't on<br/>
the LBNA site?<br/>
<br/>
thanks for all the help!  I'm hoping to plant a new box soon myself!!<br/>

 Subject: Hello from a new LB'er<br/>
<br/>
 I'm new to this list.. I was introduced to letterboxing about 2 weeks ago<br/>
by someone on a PSP newsgroup and I was immediately intrigued!  I'm in<br/>
Colorado - anyone else in Colorado on this list?<br/>

If an e-mail addy is not listed with the clues, then you can post to <br/>
the group.<br/>
<br/>
  And is there a way to search<br/>
&gt; this site for new boxes and notices about boxes in my area that <br/>
aren't on<br/>

&gt; <br/>
No. If it makes it to the talk list, it will eventually make it to <br/>
the LBNA Web site because notices of new boxes are culled from the <br/>
talk list.<br/>
<br/>
However, there are an undocumented number of cuckoo or bonus boxes <br/>
throughout the country. These are spread by word of mouth or a boxer <br/>
finds a box that IS listed on the LBNA Web site that also contains <br/>
the location of a cuckoo box. <br/>
