I am officially voicing my disapproval of Martha Stewart doing a show<br/>
about Letterboxing! Understand that I am totally crazy about Martha,<br/>
though! Although she may have personality issues in some areas, she <br/>
has done an immense service for creative homemakers everywhere. I do <br/>
follow some of Martha's advice and admire her in many ways, but I <br/>
also really love Martha jokes, Martha gags, and Martha satire as <br/>
well. <br/>
<br/>
The image attachment on your earlier post...#10862, I think, is no <br/>
longer there. Is there any way you could post it again? I would love <br/>
to see it!<br/>
<br/>
Where has this hitchhiker been sited in recent days? I would be <br/>
thrilled if she made it to South Texas!<br/>
<br/>
About a year too late,<br/>
 Busy Bee...<br/>
(who has a Martha picture that she hopes to carve into a stamp later <br/>
today!) :)<br/>
