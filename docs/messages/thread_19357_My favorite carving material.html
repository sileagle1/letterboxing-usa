throw in my two cents.<br/>
So far the best and cheapest carving material I have found comes from<br/>
Dick Blick Art Supplies. I know that that they have store fronts<br/>
somewhere but I order through the web at dickblick.com<br/>
The carving material that I like is called Soft-Kut. It is about 1/4<br/>
inch thick grey rubber material that cuts really nice. Other stuff<br/>
that I have tried is too crumbly, except Speedball's pink stuff which<br/>
isn't bad but pricey.   Soft-kut costs $1.29 for a 4x6 block or $7.69<br/>
for a 12x18 block.  Dick Blick also sells carving tools, I prefer<br/>
speedball's wooden handle over the big industrial red one. The wood<br/>
seems a nicer size for carving small soft things like letterbox stamps.<br/>
Also my favorite book on the subject is, The Weekend Crafter: Rubber<br/>
Stamp Carving: Techniques, Designs &amp; Projects<br/>

Happy Carving!<br/>
