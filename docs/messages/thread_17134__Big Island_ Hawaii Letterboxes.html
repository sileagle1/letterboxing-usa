<br/>
We just got back from a vacation on the "big island" and are pleased <br/>
to report we found 5 of 6 possible letterboxes.  No luck with <br/>
the "Mystery" box, although we did read in another logbook that <br/>
someone thought it may have been destroyed by fire.  We can't confirm <br/>
since we're not certain we even visited the right place.<br/>
<br/>
The other 5 were all in great shape and added a little extra fun to <br/>
our vacation!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, unfortunately the mystery box did burn in a wildfire last July--<br/>
the fire occured about 5 days before we visited.  All we found that <br/>
remained of the letterbox was the metal logbook spiral spine that <br/>
goes to a sketchpad logbook in the exact location as described in <br/>
the clues--it was in about 2' deep of ashes.  The only thing left in <br/>
the area was a mostly charred skeleton of a tree, a bit of a 75% <br/>
burned Pepsi can and a singed vehicle hubcap.  We attempted to <br/>
notify the placer with the sad news but never got a response.  Glad <br/>
you enjoyed the other letterboxes.  Oh, what we'd do to be able to <br/>
go back there for a bit...  ;)<br/>
