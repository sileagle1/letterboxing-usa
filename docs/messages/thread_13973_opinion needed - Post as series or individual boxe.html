I would say that if you have to DRIVE from one box to the next, you <br/>
should post them as separate boxes.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; From what I can tell, series are usually listed as boxes where <br/>
&gt; you can hike from box to box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can anyone think of an exception?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

You're right, usually when you see series, they are all in one park.  <br/>
But I have a series of 3 boxes in VA called In The Park that is in 3 <br/>
neighborhood parks within about a 1 sq mile area.  The clues have <br/>
directions on how to drive from one park to the next.  Anyone reading <br/>
the clues can see that the boxes can be done in a different order.  I <br/>
have a big series of 11 boxes coming up (if I ever get the initiative <br/>
to actually place the darn things) that will be in a bunch of <br/>
different parks.<br/>
<br/>
So, I'd say you could post them either way - as a series or as <br/>
individual boxes.  <br/>

If you can park in one location and walk to all the boxes, then they <br/>
can be all posted on one clue sheet.<br/>

<br/>
I would also add - that you could *connect* the separate boxes in <br/>
the body of the clue copy like this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Uno Box (1 of 6)<br/>
First in the Silly Name Series<br/>
Location: FooBar Park<br/>
<br/>
and then - listed as a separate Box<br/>
<br/>
The Dos Box (2 of 6)<br/>
Second in the Silly Name Series<br/>
Location: Hungadunga Park<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
... see?  That would keep the Series thing intact, and yet keep the <br/>
clues separate, letting the searcher know that the boxes <br/>
couldn't/shouldn't be hiked from one to another.<br/>
<br/>
Am I making *any* sense?<br/>

<br/>
well, ACE, you're in luck because 3 are already placed and hopefully <br/>
another will be tonight.  just need to post the clues.  <br/>
unfortunately, they're mystery boxes in Bucks County, so first you <br/>
need to solve them to know where to go!  don't worry, they're not too <br/>
hard!  plus, Bucks County isn't exactly a small geographical area...<br/>

thanks everyone!!<br/>
