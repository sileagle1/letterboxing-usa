We started the day at Hurd Park.  White Elephant, Purple Serpentine <br/>
Dragon, In search of Mokele-Mbembe, and Blue Griffin were all found <br/>
and in great shape.  Unknown Artist seems to be missing.  Not only <br/>
could we not find it, but many entries in other logs reported not <br/>
finding it, either. What a great view of the river at River Vista!! <br/>
and that white rock-WOW!! Home for lunch, and then we went in the <br/>
other direction to Whimsy Walk.  Butterfly's add-on brought us to the <br/>
cute "village" in the bushes- great for kids.  Then on to find <br/>
Drewclan's 3 boxes. Such a pretty spot, and all boxes were found and <br/>
doing well.  The Pine Bench was a bit elusive, and it's log is <br/>
getting pretty full, but there's still some room.  We met some other <br/>
LB-ers on the trail, but we'd already exchanged at the Gerbil <br/>
Gathering.  But they left their stamp on our car, just in case--how <br/>
nice!!!Thanks to the Voyageur duo.  Great Day!!- Sunshine, Swamp <br/>
Yankee, and the Toad Dog :0)   P8F239X48 <br/>
