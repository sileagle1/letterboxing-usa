There's no chance she just couldn't follow the directions because she was there when we hid it! <br/>

Sad to say, please remove this box from the website.<br/>

I liked the stamp, so I will make another, but I guess I'll have to find a different hiding spot.<br/>

after all that confusion I had was finally cleared up and now <br/>
nothing. That's so disappointing. I do hope you will replace the <br/>
stamp. We actually look forward to finding your LBs and your <br/>
stamps.<br/>
