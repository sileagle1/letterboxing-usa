So, this letter arrives in my mailbox last week.... the envelope full of<br/>
notes and postal markings and yellow stickers. The return address is<br/>
not one that I knew, and the letter came to my now defunct PO Box.<br/>
I opened it ~ and the note inside was written on a page-a-day Far Side <br/>
calendar dated May 29 ~ and read it....<br/>
   and then dropped the letter and did the dance of joy!!!!<br/>
<br/>
The opening line:<br/>
<br/>
"Dear Deborah,<br/>
    Found your box at Turville Point. How delighted I was...."<br/>
<br/>
The letter went on to say that the box "seemed to need tending"<br/>
and included the initials of the family that found it, which they were<br/>
using in lieu of personal stamps, and asked if there were more <br/>
clues for Madison....<br/>
<br/>
I could not go out to Turville Point until Monday, and my heart was<br/>
all pit-a-pat because since they had not found it from clues, it could<br/>
have been anywhere out there, it might have been in the lake for all<br/>
I knew, since he said they had been fishing!<br/>
Monday comes, and I get Melanie all in long pants and hat and bug<br/>
stuff and take along a little kit for fixing up the box if I find it ~ wipes <br/>
and<br/>
paper towels, ziplock bags, new postcards and pen.... and head out in<br/>
the late afternoon.<br/>
I've not been out this way since I discovered the box gone last November,<br/>
and the walk is definitely different in June than it is in the fall.<br/>
The trees are fully leafed, and the undergrowth off the trail is thigh-high.<br/>
Once you leave the lot and walk into the woods proper it's dark as if <br/>
suddenly the sun has gone behind a thick bank of clouds. We meet<br/>
a man coming out to the lot and he says the mosquitos are thick.<br/>
I tell him we had bug spray, and he shrugs and walks on as if<br/>
to say "you're gonna be sorry..."<br/>
  Melanie walks the whole way, uphill and down, and doesn't trip on<br/>
any of the big tree roots or rocks in the trail, 6 months has made a<br/>
big difference (well, she is FOUR now, as she will point out at <br/>
every opportunity...)<br/>
  We reach the point where the little trail goes up to the lookout, and<br/>
I peek inside the tree.... the box is there!<br/>
  When I open it, I can see that "seems to need tending" is a polite<br/>
understatement. The box is dry to the touch, but inside the plastic<br/>
bags is a different story. The beautiful notebook (same one Tom and<br/>
Bonita use, I forget the name) is swollen up with moisture, the black<br/>
cardboard cover warped and wet and bleeding onto the next pages.<br/>
The covers also have a light film of white mold. The notebook pages<br/>
are also damp and growing multi-colored stuff of orange, blue, black,<br/>
and rose that rival my daughter's science project experiment in bread<br/>
mold last spring. At this point, of course, I abandon any thoughts of<br/>
fixing it up on the spot, and we head for home. Only 4 mosquito bites<br/>
between us, and I count us very lucky indeed.<br/>
   At home, I bring the treasure inside, inwardly laughing because I<br/>
know if any of my kids brought something like this in the house I<br/>
would have said "Take that out and put it in the trash immediately!"<br/>
  The stamp in its separate ziplock is unharmed and easily cleaned<br/>
up. I put on latex gloves to salvage pages from the notebook...<br/>
the rest goes right back in the bag and into the garbage. I wipe down<br/>
the pages with a damp paper towel, and zap them in the microwave.<br/>
By this time my nose is tickley and my eyes itchy ~ I'm allergic to<br/>
this kind of thing which is why I can't help much when it's time to<br/>
clean out the basement :-)<br/>
  The only notes here that were found by the clues are Steven's and<br/>
my kids, all the rest appear to have been serendipitous finds. There's<br/>
the note from the man who plays with the Madison Symphony and<br/>
knew David Crosby (now I know his name!), and that's all from the<br/>
fall. The next entries begin with March 19, a total of 9 spring entries.<br/>
Some are from people who came to an event at the Dane County<br/>
Coliseum ~ from Detroit (what is a phat party?); a family entry on<br/>
Mother's Day with a notation of a child's first birthday; from the<br/>
handwriting, a note from the person who sent me the letter (visiting<br/>
from Alabama) from this spot they watched an oriole build a nest<br/>
with fishing line; and the last entry, from June 11 (temperature 90,<br/>
humidity 99.9) signed "Moriarty".   <br/>
<br/>
   I was so delighted to get that letter that I'm planning to send<br/>
them handcarved initial stamps as a thanks, and now I have to <br/>
figure out what to do with the letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
Tech notes:<br/>
    Postcards:<br/>
There was only one postcard left in the box (probably because<br/>
it was all moldy), but the only one I got in the mail was from <br/>
Steven. I assume this is because the stamp image was on the<br/>
postcard, and people kept it in lieu of stamping up, maybe)<br/>
<br/>
	It's Not The Heat:<br/>
How do I keep the thing dry? I can't tell what happened to it,<br/>
I don't know if it wintered out there or what, but the bags were<br/>
sealed and the box was sealed.... if this damage happened<br/>
from March to June, though, even considering that this was<br/>
an exceptionally wet spring, I can't see replacing the logbook<br/>
etc. every 3 months? Double-boxing seems like it would be<br/>
too bulky to hide around here.... should I try the silica gel<br/>
packs?<br/>
Think I might try leaving laminated cards for info/address as in<br/>
Steven's Madison box, and maybe leave out postcards...<br/>
<br/>
	INK:<br/>
It seems that the black Marvy Matchable ink, which is not a<br/>
permanent ink, works really well even when wet! The stamps<br/>
that were done in this ink were not faded or runny, and they <br/>
didn't bleed the least bit. I'm not sure which pad one of my<br/>
daughters used, but there was not a trace of the image left<br/>
on the page. Steven's stamp stood up well, too.<br/>

great story &amp; well told.  Reading it makes me itch to get out and find,<br/>

<br/>
So glad you found your box!<br/>
<br/>
If I understand correctly, it was in its original hiding place. So <br/>
probably the family did find it by means of your clues, after all. <br/>
But it was missing when you looked for it last some months ago ... so <br/>
whoever took it out returned it - from remorse, or perhaps simply <br/>
because that person took it home (in the rain?) to stamp up and <br/>
peruse at leisure. In that case, it might have only been out of its <br/>
place for a very short time.<br/>
<br/>
I did that with Rae's letterbox on the cape this April: we took it <br/>
back to our motel room for the night, as it was raining, and put it <br/>
back the next day.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the important thing is that you have the stamp back and can <br/>
resalt the box soon.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should retopic this as Happy Mother's Day!<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

I'm glad you rescued us all from that cliffhanger!!!  I haven't felt like <br/>
that since JR Ewing got shot!!!<br/>

Yuck... I guess I was lucky!!  When I checked my boxes in the Columbia River <br/>
Gorge, I found several had water inside the box, but my zip-lock freezer bags <br/>
had all held tight.  No small statement considering that it rains here for <br/>
about 9 or 10 months out of the year!!  Were yours freezer bags or sandwich <br/>
bags?<br/>

<br/>
Good point... best not to make the postcards seem like a nice souvenier.  <br/>
I've noticed that Thom Cheney always stamps up several pages in the back of <br/>
his guestbook.  That way, if they don't have an inkpad, they can just pull <br/>
out a page as a keepsake.  Not a bad idea!!<br/>

<br/>
What size box are you using?  So far, I've not been double-boxing, but have <br/>
considered doing so.  For a guestbook, I use pads of sketch paper.  The <br/>
Strathmore pads are 3.5 by 5", but there are some other brands available that <br/>
are only 3 x 5".  These smaller pads fit nicely into a Rubbermaid 12 oz <br/>
Servin' Saver #3864 (6"x 3.5" x 1.5").  This container will then fit into a <br/>
Rubbermaid 24 oz Servin' Saver #3865 (7.5" x 4.5" x 2), which is not too hard <br/>
to hide.  You might have trouble getting postcards in there, but I've had no <br/>
trouble getting the pad, stamp, and several folded info sheets to fit into <br/>
the #3864.<br/>

lol! sorry about that! I really -meant- to write sooner!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Were yours freezer bags or sandwich bags?<br/>
<br/>
As I recall, the set up was sandwich/snack bags for the <br/>
different components, and the whole lot nestled into a quart<br/>
size ziplock freezer storage bag, and that in a Rubbermaid<br/>
Servin'Saver (blue top / 1.7 pt, 805 ml)<br/>
I'm thinking the problems were due to wintering out (may have<br/>
compromised the watertightness, (expansion/contraction?) <br/>
but I don't get how the bags got damp inside... and the heat<br/>
of the spring/summer, which caused things to "blossom".<br/>
<br/>

Great idea! I'm making a note of it....<br/>
 Thanks for the suggestions!<br/>

&gt; Dear Deborah,<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  So glad you found your box!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! Me, too! Ecstatic, in fact!<br/>
Now I am: F1/P+1-1+1!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the box was in its original hiding place, but, if one took<br/>
a step to the right and looked inside the tree where it was <br/>
hidden, it was quite visible, which is why I assumed that most <br/>
of these finds were accidental. The clues for the box have not<br/>
been published anywhere since last fall.<br/>
  I think you're quite right, that someone took the box and <br/>
replaced it shortly thereafter.... I must have just missed it!<br/>
It snowed not long after the last time I was there, which is why<br/>
I did not go out again last fall. I'm a couple months behind in<br/>
my "spring" plans, sigh....<br/>
I must say I like the fact that 6-10 people/groups of people found<br/>
the box accidentally, and left it there.... and it wasn't carried off<br/>
by raccoons or washed away in the rain! Trying to decide if<br/>
I should leave it there or find another spot....<br/>

<br/>
And now I just have to go find out how many other<br/>
Madison letterboxers have visited the Majestic Theater<br/>
Letterbox too.<br/>
<br/>
On a technical note - the letterboxes I've been using<br/>
have been of the same "make and model" as Deborah's,<br/>
and they have all checked out fine after a winter and<br/>
spring of similar conditions.  (Except the Cana Island<br/>
one, which has become temporarily inaccessible -<br/>
unless you have long arms that is.  It fell deeper<br/>
into the hollow of the tree it was in!)  I'll check<br/>
the others again now that summer is here with the heat<br/>
and humidity.  <br/>
<br/>
Glad to have you back Deborah, and I'm looking forward<br/>
to more letterboxes from you!<br/>
