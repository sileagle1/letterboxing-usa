&gt;&gt;  This is to let you know that I'm first stamp in your first ten<br/>
&gt;&gt;  letterboxes, the upper and lower Franklin Canyon Series.  I've got<br/>
&gt;&gt;  your "Head" HH, and will move it along shortly.  Thank you for the<br/>

    It took me 120-130 minutes to put the second stamp in all 10 boxes.<br/>
Things were moving along until Lower #4 (seventh overall). It wasn't there.<br/>
Since most of the earlier boxes were exposed, I presumed it plundered and<br/>
went on. I got to Lower #5 and found it very well covered by Buzzard. So I<br/>
went back to Lower #4 (only 100 yards or so) to look again, this time closer<br/>
and with a long stick. Sure enough, Lower #4 was there, hidden as well as<br/>
any box I've found so far. There was absolutely no indication that there was<br/>
anything "foreign" there until I struck the box with the stick. That was<br/>
probably fifteen extra minutes of adventure. The only other delay was five<br/>
minutes or so waiting for a family to leave the area of the last box.<br/>
<br/>
    A strong trail runner could pull it off in forty-five minutes if they<br/>
really really really wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
    This was a fun series and a nice park. The clues were straight forward<br/>
and accurate, as they were meant to be. If only Buzzard had left the HH...<br/>

You know I can't leave the HH, but I'm thinking of leaving it in one <br/>
of Eric's LBs, which I'm going for next weekend.  If you're still out <br/>
west, I believe you'll find the next Gnosis HH in their Peter Strause <br/>
Ranch series, which I have yet to visit.  You mentioned in your post <br/>
that some of the Gnosis boxes were still out in the open.  I found <br/>
most of them that way, and tried to cover them up a little better, <br/>
but I wasn't sure how far I should go with this, because if Gnosis <br/>
wanted to leave them exposed, who am I to butt in.  From what you <br/>
report, it sounds like they're still too exposed, is that right?  <br/>
Happy LBing!!<br/>
