shortly afterward, a certain website got re-organized making it more<br/>
difficult (but not impossible) to decipher the location.  I decided to<br/>
give it until Sept. 1.  If no one had found him by then, I would<br/>
change it from a mystery box to a regular box.  Well, he's now<br/>
de-mystified!  Lobo the Hobo is hidden along the Chautauqua County's<br/>
Rails to Trails.  Complete details on how to find Lobo can be found on<br/>
the LBNA website.<br/>
<br/>
This morning was a sponsored hike along the CCRTT.  One of the<br/>
participants was Jim, the chairman of CCRTT.  I explained letterboxing<br/>
to him and asked if I could hide boxes along the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Jim: This will bring more people to our trails?<br/>
Me: Yup!<br/>
Jim: What does "Rails to Trails" need to do?<br/>
Me: Give permission.<br/>
Jim: That's it?<br/>
Me: Yup!<br/>
Jim: In that case, knock yourself out!  Go for it!<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, I've recently received reports that two of my other<br/>
boxes, "Little Fishie" and "Every Day is Earth Day" have gone missing.<br/>
 "Earth Day" is *still* in place as of yesterday, and I was pleased at<br/>
the number of stamps in the logbook.  I will be checking up on<br/>
"Fishie" later this weekend.<br/>

P.S. Sept 19th is "Talk Like a Pirate Day", or as we refer to it<br/>
aboard ship, "Amateur Night" :D<br/>
