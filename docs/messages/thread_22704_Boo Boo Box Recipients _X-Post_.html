when the Boo Boo Box disappeared.  If I am able to reconstruct the <br/>
logbook, then I may continue on with the Boo Boo Box.<br/>
<br/>
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP!<br/>
<br/>
If you ever received the Boo Boo Box, please send me an email with your <br/>
Boo Boo Box "story".  I will compile these stories and reconstruct a <br/>
new logbook that includes these original stories.  Once that is done <br/>
and a new stamp is made, I can send the newly restored Boo Boo Box on <br/>
to the next deserving recipient and we can continue the tradition.<br/>
<br/>
THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN WITH YOUR HELP !!!  PLEASE EMAIL YOUR STORY TO ME <br/>
ASAP !!!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for your help,<br/>
