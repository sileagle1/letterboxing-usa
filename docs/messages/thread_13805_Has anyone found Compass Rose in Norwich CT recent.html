We've tried a couple of times, using a couple of ways, and end up in about<br/>
the same spot, but no box to be found. I didn't think our compass skills<br/>
were that bad! I love the clue though - something a little bit different.<br/>

Hi Judy,<br/>
    I helped Sue find that box about a month ago.  It is definitely a tricky<br/>
one to find with so many rocks around.  Keep trying, perhaps hunting around<br/>
will help more now that you've got the general area.  Good luck and have<br/>
fun!<br/>
