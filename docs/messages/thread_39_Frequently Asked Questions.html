By popular demand, I have assembled a list of answers to "Frequently Asked<br/>
Questions" for this talk list.  The text of this document follows, and can<br/>

"Letterbox USA" Talk List:  Frequently Asked Questions<br/>
<br/>
1.  What is LETTERBOXING?<br/>
<br/>
	Answer:  Letterboxing is an intriguing pastime dating back to the 1850's in<br/>
	rural Dartmoor, England.  It combines map-reading skills, artistic ability,<br/>
and<br/>
	delightful "treasure-hunts" in beautiful and scenic places.  In recent times,<br/>
	this facsinating hobby has found its way into the hearts and minds of<br/>
Americans,<br/>
	becoming popular with rubber stamp enthusiasts, hikers, orienteering buffs,<br/>
and<br/>
	others who just want to introduce a little fresh air and adventure into their<br/>
	lives.  For more information, visit the "Letterbox USA" website at:<br/>
	http://www.pclink.com/elf<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2.  How do I send messages to the "Letterbox USA" talk list?<br/>
<br/>
	Answer:  Simply address your email to:<br/>
	letterbox-usa@egroups.com<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3.  How do I subscribe to the "Letterbox USA" talk list?<br/>
<br/>
	Answer:  Just send any message to:<br/>
	egroups.com-subscribe@letterbox-usa<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4.  Where can I view the Archive of previous "Letterbox USA" talk list<br/>
messages?<br/>
<br/>
	Answer:  Point your web browser to:<br/>
	http://www.eGroups.com/list/letterbox-usa<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5.  How do I get set up to receive daily digests of the "Letterbox USA" talk<br/>
list<br/>
    messages, rather than receiving each message individually?  (or visa-<br/>
versa?)<br/>
<br/>
	Answer:  The easiest way is to simply e-mail one of the administrators of<br/>
	the talk list and ask them to change this for you.  Send your request to<br/>
	either Mitch Klink, our talk list coordinator, at:  letterboxr@aol.com<br/>
	or Dan Servatius, the host of "Letterbox USA", at:  elf@pclink.com<br/>
<br/>
	The most thorough way to set this and other attributes associated with<br/>
	your membership to the talk list is to go in and edit your member profile.<br/>
	For instructions on this process, see question number 7, below.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6.  How do I un-subscribe from the "Letterbox USA" talk list?<br/>
<br/>
	Answer:  We'd hate to see you go, but all you need to do is send a message<br/>
to:<br/>
	egroups.com-unsubscribe@letterbox-usa<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
7.  What is my group profile, and how do I edit it?<br/>
<br/>
	Answer:  The "Letterbox USA" talk list is hosted by EGROUPS.  If you register<br/>
	with this service, you will be able to modify many aspects of your membership<br/>
	with the talk list.  For example, you will be able to directly change the<br/>
	settings for how you receive messages from the group (digest vs. individual<br/>
	e-mails).  You will also be able to enter the name you wish to use when<br/>
	corresponding with the group (by default, you will be referred to by your<br/>
	email address).  The following instructions will show you how to register<br/>
with<br/>
	EGROUPS and then modify your talk list membership attributes.<br/>
<br/>
	On the Archive page, (see #4 above) press the "Subscribe" button. <br/>
	In order to make changes to your profile, you will need to open an account.<br/>
	Click on the link that says "Register for a FREE eGroups.com account."<br/>
	On the next page, enter your E-mail address, and press "Continue."<br/>
	You will then receive an e-mail message which includes an access code.<br/>
	To set up your account, enter this access code, and some basic info about<br/>
	yourself, into the online form.  You will then be asked to set your password.<br/>
<br/>
	Once you've completed this process, the "Subscribe" button on our Archive<br/>
page<br/>
	will now take you directly to the page where you can specify how you receive<br/>
	your messages.  Set the Read Mode for either "Individual E-mails" or "Daily <br/>
	E-mail Digest".  To set	other attributes associated with your membership,<br/>
press<br/>
	the link at the top of the Archive page that says "HOME".  The next page will<br/>
	show the "Letterbox USA" talk list, and any other EGROUPS talk lists that you<br/>
	participate in.  Put a check next to "Letterbox USA" by clicking in the box<br/>
in<br/>
	front of it.  Then click the Link at the bottom of the page that says "Edit<br/>
My<br/>
	Profile".  This will take you to the page where you set your name and other<br/>
	attributes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
8.  What's so special about "Letterbox USA"?<br/>
<br/>
	Answer:  You are.  The "Letterbox USA" website and talk list have been<br/>
created<br/>
	by letterboxers, like you, in response to feedback received from you and your<br/>
	fellow hobbyists.  Other attempts have been made to provide services for the<br/>
	American letterboxing scene,  but have involved more talk about overhead<br/>
	expenses, membership fees, and publishing rights than letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
	But "Letterbox USA" is different.  It's where the whole American Letterboxing<br/>
	phenomenon began.  It is the only site that has always been directed by and<br/>
	devoted to the people...the adventurers...the pioneers of American<br/>
Letterboxing.<br/>
	Rather than being another capitalistic attempt to monopolize letterbox clues,<br/>
	"Letterbox USA" strives to promote open communications, provide FREE quality<br/>
	services, and, above all, maintain an atmosphere of respect for the needs of<br/>
the<br/>
	hobbyist and for the traditional "spirit" of Letterboxing.<br/>

<br/>
	With regard to the Kid's corner:  GREAT IDEA!<br/>
<br/>
	Sheila beat me to it by a long shot BUT I did begin to carve an ice<br/>
cream cone and a swing stamp to make some map clues for a new box<br/>
somewhere in our village.  On Wednesday nights in the summer the<br/>
traditional New England town green is filled with families (and<br/>
tourists) listening to the 5-town (very rural) band (ages 12-85) play<br/>
from the gazebo.  Bake sales, canoe raffles, chicken barbecues, and<br/>
other folksy activites also brighten the scene.  Because we have so many<br/>
bats, there are no mosquitoes until about 9pm and the sun can set<br/>
peacefully to the strains of Strauss, Sousa and the National Anthem<br/>
(yes, we actuallly sing along).  The box may have to move each week<br/>
because kids tend to travel in packs and the secret would be out in an<br/>
evening but it might be a way to engage several families each week.  <br/>
<br/>
	Funny thing happening here over the past 4 months since the flood, huge<br/>
sasquatch style footprints have appeared (painted) on sidewalks and road<br/>
crossing.  Yesterday, a set of baby prints appeared.  Any ideas on<br/>
incorporating the prints in a latterbox?  Do you think the flood washed<br/>
"IT" out of a hibernation?<br/>

&gt; The FAQs are great - this whole LUSA group is working out so well!  So<br/>
&gt;  much energy being spent CREATING, not squabbling.  One small thing, I<br/>

<br/>
Geez, who do these letterboxers think they are?  Like, I'm really going to<br/>
change our "official" FAQ list just because some letterboxer from New England<br/>
thinks it might be nice.  You'll read your FAQ's in the order that I tell you<br/>
to read them, or you'll do without FAQ's altogether!!!!  Another outburst like<br/>
that, Erik, and I'll have you banned from the Internet entirely!!!   ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Just kidding, Erik... you're suggestions were greatly appreciated.  This is<br/>
what it's all about.. everybody pulling together for the good of the hobby.  I<br/>
think the effort that everyone has put into creating these services is<br/>
fantastic.  Really reflects the cordial, provincial spirit that inspired the<br/>
letterboxing phenomenon in the first place.  I'm glad to have been able to<br/>
contribute something to this project.<br/>
<br/>
I invite everyone to take a look at the latest revision of the FAQ list and<br/>
offer any suggestions you may have:  <br/>
