                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I think we have a quorum on this issue.  The boxes in question<br/>
are the Letterboxer's Tour of Georgetown, a very clever series of<br/>
boxes that I did on a slow Thursday afternoon.  I couldn't snag #1<br/>
because a gardener was literally three feet from its hiding place.  At<br/>
#2 I experienced a boxing first for me:  I ran into other boxers "in<br/>
the wild!"   This lovely family from Lynchburg, VA (hi John, Heather,<br/>
Alyssa and Danielle - although I may have misremembered that last one)<br/>
told me they had found #1 laying in the open and rehid it, but I fear<br/>
my gardener may have reexposed it during her efforts.  I saw a note on<br/>
the board that #1 had already been found by the house staff on at<br/>
least one occasion and replanted!<br/>
<br/>
2 and 3 were found, 3 at the beautiful Tudor Place gardens, a cool<br/>
place I otherwise never would have visited despite living near DC.  I<br/>
did not find 4, 5, 7 and 8.  The majority view seems to be that I can<br/>
note that these locations are very exposed, either to the elements or<br/>
publicity.  The vent cover over #7 no longer exists.  #6 was found and<br/>
looks pretty secure, as long as everyone is cautious in rehiding it. <br/>
9 and 10 were way too public for me to attempt.  10, which I gather<br/>
contains the log, is not only roped off now but is in full view of a<br/>
group of C&amp;O canal reenactors, complete with mules!<br/>
<br/>
All in all a fun if challenging series of boxes.  My only regret is<br/>
that I didn't think to exchange stamps with the other boxers until too<br/>
late!<br/>
