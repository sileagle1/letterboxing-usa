Difficulty - easy<br/>
Time - hardly any unless you see the museum, and we think you should.<br/>
Directions to starting place -  Take Route 9 West from Concord; 9<br/>
East from Keene. At the junction of Routes 9 and 31 North, turn onto <br/>
Route 31 North. The Pierce Homestead is immediately in view on the <br/>
right.<br/>

Something Franklin wrote about his life in Hillsborough<br/>
"I leave Hillsborough with no ordinary regret. There are a thousand <br/>
reasons why it cannot be otherwise - I have hitherto known no other <br/>
home. Here have passed many of the happiest days and months of my <br/>
life. With these streams and mountains are associated most of the <br/>
delightful recollections of buoyant and happy boyhood, and in my<br/>
early intercourse with the generous, independent, and intelligent <br/>
yeomanry of Hillsborough. I became attached to, and learned how to <br/>
highly appreciate this class of community which constitutes the true<br/>
nobility of this country. I need hardly say that I shall never cease <br/>
to remember my birthplace with pride as well as affection, and with<br/>
still more pride shall I recollect the steady, unqualified and <br/>
generous confidence which has been reposed in me by its inhabitants."<br/>
-Franklin Pierce-<br/>
<br/>
Franklin Pierce was the 14th president of the United States and he<br/>
was born and raised in Hillsborough. History tells us that he was<br/>
actually a rather ineffectual president, but we still think it's neat <br/>
that he was a Hillsborough native. The house was built by Franklin's <br/>
father, Benjamin, who was twice governor of New Hampshire and was <br/>
postmaster for Hillsborough. Daniel Webster and Nathaniel Hawthorne <br/>
were both visitors here.  Franklin was the seventh child born to his <br/>
family. Franklin Pierce was the only president to affirm the oath of <br/>
office rather than to swear it.  Interesting.<br/>
<br/>

Clues:		<br/>
Start in the northernmost driveway near the stonewall. Head NNW in<br/>
the grass toward the woods, parallel with the stone wall about 10<br/>
feet to your left. Once you enter the woods (there is no trail) you <br/>
will quickly find two closeish pines. If you stand next to the first <br/>
of the pines, you can see a mailbox on the road at 260 degrees. The <br/>
letterbox is at the base of the tree under a pine needle carpet.  <br/>
Enjoy the box and the town.<br/>
