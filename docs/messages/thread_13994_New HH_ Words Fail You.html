Philadelphia airport yesterday where I was lucky enough to meet Amanda from <br/>
Seattle as we were both waiting for planes. Before we departed for opposite <br/>
coasts, I gave her the Words Fail You HH (which includes a mini-CD of the <br/>
Kris Delmhorst song of the same name).<br/>
<br/>
Considering Amanda's traveling ways, who knows where Words Fail You might <br/>
end up!<br/>
