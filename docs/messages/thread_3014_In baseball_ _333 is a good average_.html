<br/>
Okay, I'll admit it: the hikes are certainly enjoyable, but I sure do like <br/>
the thrill and satisfaction of finding those letterboxes, too! (Akin to <br/>
finding the little toy surprise inside a box of cereal.) So it was with some <br/>
measure of frustration that I found myself unable to turn up two of the three <br/>
boxes that ESAK recently placed at Guiffrida Park in Meriden, CT. Thankfully, <br/>
however, after coming up empty-handed on the "Chauncey Peak" and "Timber" <br/>
boxes (Elmer, I swear that I looked just about everywhere for 'em!) I found <br/>
the third box, "Nosebreaker" and, in fact, was the first person to stamp in <br/>
(great stamp, BTW!).<br/>
<br/>
The first part of this hike is indeed strenuous, but the views from atop and <br/>
along the ridge are worth the climb, even on a somewhat hazy day. I'm already <br/>
thinking about going back in the fall, after the weather turns cooler and the <br/>
leaves change color, to try to find those first two boxes. But for now they <br/>
remain as-yet undisturbed, waiting silently to be unearthed by those whose <br/>
powers of observation are greater than mine!<br/>
<br/>
