                    <div class="plaintext-content">... are not a good place to put Letterboxing HitchHikers.  A while <br/>
back I received an e-mail from a geocacher in another state <br/>
indicating that they had found my "travel bug" but could not find <br/>
him listed at the geocaching site.  Apparently the HH - Lucky Lil <br/>
Lizard, had been placed in a hybrid box and these folks were true <br/>
blue cachers and had no idea what a LB HH was.<br/>
<br/>
I explained to her and asked that they either send it back to me or <br/>
place it in another hybrid box clearly labeled as a LB HH (which it <br/>
had been when I first put it out).  I hadn't heard anything further <br/>
and wrote her a few days ago asking what ever happened to the little <br/>
lizard.  He has apparently become the booty to some geocacher in OK <br/>
or somewhere that way, as they "forgot" that it was a LB HH and <br/>
moved it on into a regular geocache.  <br/>
<br/>
I am not posting this to start a flame war or a debate over the <br/>
virtues of letterboxing over geocaching -- actually, I have nothing <br/>
against geocaching and geocachers.  The MiGO (Michigan Geocaching <br/>
Organization) is a great group and we do not seem to have the <br/>
problems here that are reported in other parts of the country.  I am <br/>
actually working right now with the folks at MiGO to try and change <br/>
a new Michigan DNR policy regarding caches and letterboxes in State <br/>
Parks.  Rather I am posting this in hopes that people will remember <br/>
this is letterboxing.  If you do both, that is cool -- but please <br/>
keep the LB goodies for other letterboxers.  Thanks!<br/>

Have you posted this on any of the geocaching forums? It seems like <br/>
such a well-stated reminder would be even more useful out on the <br/>
caching messageboards and forums. If you don't participate in those <br/>
forums, perhaps people here that do geocaching could volunteer to <br/>
post the message for you. <br/>
<br/>
Just a thought...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I get a chance, I will look up at the geocaching site the box <br/>
where they placed it and see if I can follow a trail to maybe find <br/>
the whereabouts of the Lucky Lil Lizard.  I may put a note out then <br/>
about it in hopes of at least making true blue (non-letterboxing) <br/>
geocachers aware of LB HH, but really I think the responsibility <br/>
lies with letterboxers to make sure our HH don't end up in caches, <br/>
not with geocachers to know what to do with them if they find them.  <br/>
Thanks for the suggestion, I am sure it wouldn't hurt.<br/>
