It's Clement &amp; Elizabeth here...in Pasadena....We went to visit the<br/>
SNAIL today with our 7 year old grandson and our son-in-law.....We had<br/>
a great time.  The water was flowing over the falls (lightly) so we<br/>
had some great poses....then followed your directions until we were in<br/>
the midst of that aromatic eucalytus tree where our grandson found the<br/>
jar/box.  We loved the SNAIL as we do the SNAKE....so...you might<br/>
assume the SNAKE is still with us heading east.  Thank you for the<br/>
wonderful location at Millard Falls......Do you have any others in the<br/>
area (within 40 miles??).....Clement &amp; Elizabeth, Andrew, Steven (our<br/>
daughter Karen Ann was riding her horse so she didn't come with us)...<br/>

We did get your personal reply and were very happy to get it......We'll be<br/>
back on SoCal in September/October and will try more of your locations<br/>
since we had such a good time at Millard Falls..<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
