All are actually in Middlefield, CT - Middlesex County:  (NOT MERIDEN, NEW<br/>
HAVEN COUNTY)<br/>

White Birch<br/>
Wadsworth falls<br/>
Giant's Laurel<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I can tell you the Giant's Laurel is intack and sound - and had a<br/>
travelling letterbox with it on 5/19/02.  Unfortuneately, we still have no<br/>
stamp and therefore did not want to move it.  Hopefully will get stamp soon<br/>
as we LOVE this whole concept!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Guess I'll take this moment to introduce - My name is Toni-Lynn and my<br/>
husband is CA.  Just got into letterboxing and I am fully gung ho!!  Found<br/>
out about this through Connecticut magazine's little margin article, then<br/>
got on line, and BAM!  I'm hooked.  Unfortuneately we cannot agree on a<br/>
stamp design and therefore have not actually "started".  We have found boxes<br/>
and that has just made me more anxious, esp since the first one we found had<br/>
just had a travelling box left with it!!  Anyway, we've ordered a<br/>
"membership" patch and am looking forward to this activity.  We have a list<br/>
of 10 or so places that we feel would be perfect to place some boxes.  We<br/>
have a 100lb yellow lab named Gofur who I hope will be coming along on many<br/>
a journey.  Roo (the cat) I think we'll be leaving at home.  We live in<br/>
Higganum, CT - right in the center of the state and the hot bed of<br/>
letterboxing.  Love it!<br/>
<br/>
thanks.<br/>

That article was written by my good buddy (and fellow Collinsville <br/>
letterboxer) Sugarmaker, who is much too modest to have trumpeted its <br/>
publication to this list. And I'm pleased to note that a copy of my stamp <br/>
(the Red Diner) appears at the bottom of the article. Woo hoo!!<br/>

Just thought you'd like to know.<br/>
