<div>Hi Music Woman,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I just went letterboxing last week in that 
area.  Even with snow (gotta be willing to wear many layers of clothes) we 
found a few (Watson Mystery Box Series, Buddy Attick Park, Maydale Nature 
Center).  If you're staying in the DC area (after the blizzard clears) you 
shouldn't have too many problems; public transportation should be up and running 
again.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I live in central Virginia and we got 4 inches of 
snow with a few inches of ice on top of that.  Thankfully that has blown 
(literally) by us for now.  Four wheel drives are doing okay on the back 
roads.  Its when you get on the main roads that are a problem.  Some 
folks just don't know how to drive in snow and should stay home.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We will be doing some more of the *in town* 
(Chinatown, Smithsonian, etc.) in a little while.  Trouble is we love 
to walk rather than drive and park!</div>

                    <html><body>Hi Lake Anna Lady!  I'm going to DC on Thursday, and boxing in DC (hopefully!) on Friday.  If you aren't working and would like to join me, I would LOVE the company!  Up here in CT, we're used to wearing many layers of clothes.  I've been boxing most of the winter (until the two feet of snow we're getting now!!!), so anything one foot or less shouldn't bother me too much.  I'll just be sure to wear waterproof pants :-)
<br/>
<br/>When I get there, I'm going to figure out if I'm going to box around The Mall on Friday.  I know that I will visit the Smithsonian and most likely Chinatown and National Geographic, but other than that, I do not know what boxes I will be able to find.  I would also like to plant one in Alexandria, VA and Havre de Grace and North East, MD while I'm there, but with the snow, that may be too hard :-(
