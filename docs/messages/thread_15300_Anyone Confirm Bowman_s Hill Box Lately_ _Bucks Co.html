today, with no luck.  The first part of the clues was good fun and we <br/>
got to practice our compass skills with the kids.  But after getting <br/>
to the other side of the fence on the Ecology Trail, we were <br/>
stumped.  We floundered for at least an hour trying to figure out the <br/>
clues and trying to find the landmarks described.  We were up and <br/>
down the trail at least 4 or 5 times.  So we were just wondering if <br/>
anyone has confirmed the box or also attempted it with no luck?  <br/>
Anyone?  Bueller?<br/>

attempt before we try Bowman's Hill. We might not get to it. Depends <br/>
on how hard the rest are, what time we get started, and how fussy <br/>
TrailSnail gets. LOL<br/>
I'll let you know how things work out.<br/>
Have you been to the other boxes in the area. There's at least 8 in <br/>
that general vicinity.  :)<br/>
