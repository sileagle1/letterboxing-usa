I suppose that many of you have seen the scene near the end of the <br/>

Allegedely, they couldn't find a suitable wall for their purposes, and<br/>
actually had to make one just for the movie.<br/>
<br/>
I can believe that, since you tend not to see a lot of stone walls out<br/>
in the open around here (I live in Grantham, NH), they all tend to be<br/>
in the forest and underbrush.<br/>

<br/>
To give a more complete answer to this question...  The Directors<br/>
Notes to Shawshank are available on the web through<br/>
http://welcome.to/shawshank.  The particular page is<br/>
<br/>
http://people.we.mediaone.net/younglee1/scenes_251a.htm<br/>
<br/>
Under "Scene 292A" the director talks about renting the field from a<br/>
farmer in Ohio, harvesting the alfalfa growing on it, building the<br/>
stone wall by hand[1], and letting the alfalfa grow back in time to<br/>
film it.<br/>
<br/>
So it's in Ohio, probably near Mansfield, where the "Shawshank" Prison[2]<br/>
is.<br/>
<br/>
[1] There's a quote in the cited page about "You didn't think we just<br/>
found that wall, did you", which makes more sense now that I know the<br/>
field was in Ohio.  If they were in New England, they might've<br/>
actually found something... (You know, the terrain shown in Shawshank<br/>
did look a little less hilly than most of New England)<br/>
<br/>
[2] Actually the old Mansfield Reformatory, which is rather neat.<br/>
Visit it if your are in the area.<br/>
