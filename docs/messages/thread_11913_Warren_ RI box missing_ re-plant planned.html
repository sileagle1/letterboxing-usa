the original hiding spot can no longer be used. It's taking a little <br/>
longer than I'd hoped to get the re-plant out so let's consider it <br/>
"Temporarily Absent." Last night after dark, after the rain I was out <br/>
standing on a milk crate with a flashlight checking out another <br/>
hiding spot that Mr. Coon suggested, but it might have its own <br/>
problems, mainly being too high off the ground. I'm thinking about <br/>
redesigning the box as a microbox, which would be less noticeable in <br/>
a high-traffic park. I'll post again when it's ready.<br/>
