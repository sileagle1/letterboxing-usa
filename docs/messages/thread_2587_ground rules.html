I have had off-list requests to moderate the list and establish<br/>
ground rules, based on recent language and tone in certain posts,<br/>
after I made a request for "civil behaviour".  I concur with some<br/>
that some of the language and tone _since_ I made that request has<br/>
not been, by my definition, civil.  IMO, such a request should not<br/>
be necessary -- for the request to have been ignored is absurd.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the deal.  Letterboxing is a family activity.  The most fun<br/>
I've ever had letterboxing was when my wife, my 3 year old son, and<br/>
myself found the box at Emory University (college?) in Atlanta.  <br/>
That is what it is all about.  The Valley Quest people in New England,<br/>
in many ways, have figured out what it is all about -- I quote from<br/>
their clue book:  "Adventures in the Upper Valley for the playful.<br/>
For ages 3 to 93".<br/>
<br/>
If, in my opinion, further posts are not suitable for the audience <br/>
described in the previous paragraph, I will moderate you.  Let<br/>
me be clear -- its not about point of view in any political wrangling;<br/>
that is always welcome -- its about word choice, tone, and ad hominem <br/>
attacks.  KEEP IT FAMILY SAFE.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any comments or concerns on this, please e-mail me <br/>
off-list, or discuss it on-list if that is your want, but I <br/>
think most of us would prefer if this dies peacefully, and <br/>
graciously.<br/>
