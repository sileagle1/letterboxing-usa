think that it's a great idea and would promote repeat visits.  <br/>
<br/>
Taking a step back from the idea of upgrading stamps.  In some ways <br/>
it would be nice to rotate stamps encouraging people to visit a <br/>
location more than once.  There is a local refuge that we frequent on <br/>
a regular basis that I have placed boxes in.  Each season there are <br/>
remarkable things that impress me about this lovely gem - the winter <br/>
ice formations, spring flowers, lush summer growth and fall colors.  <br/>
I think that visiting the spot only once to "nab" the box <br/>
shortchanges the location.  I have contemplated emulating <br/>
LoneMassWolf's idea of a seasonal box to encourage people to visit <br/>
the location in different seasons.<br/>
