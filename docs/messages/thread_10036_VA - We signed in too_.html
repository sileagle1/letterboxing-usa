BRRRR -- it is cold out there when the wind blows!  But, it didn't seem to <br/>
bother the ducks and geese floating on the water around this little island.<br/>
<br/>
After wonderful trips to see the Trompe L'oeil exhibit at the National <br/>
Gallery East and a quick swing through Air &amp; Space, we went to look for this <br/>
DC microbox.  It is a cute little box and everything fits in so well!  <br/>
(you're version of this image turned out much, much better than the one I <br/>
tried which was way too bad to be placed in a box).<br/>
<br/>
We had fun be the first to sign into the book and then looking up all the <br/>
signatures of the original Declaration of Independence signers from all the <br/>
different colonies.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, a letterbox has led us to a really neat place that we never <br/>
would have discovered on our own!  Thanks!  BeMa<br/>

one!)<br/>
