                    <div class="plaintext-content">That was my P47! since sept's Hartford Courant article.  It was a <br/>
great day out there. I know there will be another one as a recent <br/>
newbie mentioned one she wants to put out too.  It will be in the <br/>
hollow also. But since the lake is huge and varied the more the <br/>
merrier. We just have to find places above the flood zone. Timmy ( <br/>
Cowboy) was  wondering when Melissa and Dan would find it when we hid <br/>
it.  He was  not suprised to see your reply.  Come and Get It! More <br/>
days of fun in the sun coming. I am doing a school wie workshop in <br/>
our elementary school soon. The boy scouts and girls scouts locally <br/>
have picked it up too.  More and more kids learning about the woods <br/>
and the beautiful town they live in .  I actually carved the stamp I <br/>
his today way back at the winter gathering in Tolland with borrowed <br/>
speedy carving set. That really got me going in carving she was just <br/>
waiting for a good nesting site.   Carol<br/>
