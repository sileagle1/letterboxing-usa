Well, in the spirit of "If you plant them, they will come", I had a great<br/>
time over the weekend planting my very first letterbox - and also the<br/>
first letterbox in the central Missouri area.  I learned about<br/>
letterboxing through the Carving Consortium, and it seems like a wonderful<br/>
intersection of my love of both nature and art -- okay, and puzzles, too!<br/>
:)  Have fun!  <br/>

The Bat Cave Letterbox<br/>
Planted by Webfoot on 8/31/02<br/>
Difficulty: Moderate - not a long walk, but there are some stairs<br/>
<br/>
Rock Bridge Memorial State Park is right in the middle of Missouri,<br/>
located approximately 130 miles from both St. Louis and Kansas City.  It<br/>
should take 2 to 2-1/2 hours, depending on traffic.  From I-70, take<br/>
Providence Road (Exit 126) south through Columbia, about 6 miles.  At the<br/>
first traffic light *after* the road narrows to two lanes, turn left<br/>
staying on Highway 163.  After about 1 mile, the park office and main park<br/>
entrance will be on your right.  This is *not* the one you want.  Travel<br/>
about another mile and the park entrance with the Rock Bridge and Devil's<br/>
Icebox will also be on your right.  This is where the trail you want<br/>
starts.  <br/>
<br/>
Have fun learning about bats, caves,  seeing a couple of interesting<br/>
geological formations and some lovely scenery.<br/>
<br/>
Head toward the Icebox - <br/>
The bats like it cool;<br/>
Or warmish in winter<br/>
When sleeping's the rule.<br/>
<br/>
Up to the right and over<br/>
or through?<br/>
Straight under Rock Bridge<br/>
Is the pathway for you.<br/>
<br/>
You can read about bats<br/>
And stalagmites and caves,<br/>
But please don't disturb <br/>
The endangered; help save!<br/>
<br/>
Then, continue along <br/>
To the bright, yellow "3".<br/>
There's quite a nice view<br/>
