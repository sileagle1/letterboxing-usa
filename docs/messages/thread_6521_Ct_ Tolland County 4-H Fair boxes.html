&gt; What are the hours on the other days? (open-close)Tolland County 4-<br/>
H Fair Aug 9,10,11 you would think I would have put these  in the <br/>
first time but I actually had to look them up. Im usually there very <br/>
early to clean barns and leave very late when cleanup and animals <br/>
quiet for the night.    So here goes. Fri and Sat. 9-10  Sunday 8-3 <br/>
Now that wasn't so hard..... but getting a cow named Millie to stop <br/>
walking on my feet thats another story..... to be continued. To give <br/>
a hint as to how  " Far Out" our fair is, the cows are in the Milky <br/>
Way   we have Lost in Sheep , visit Planet Cluck and buy some Out of <br/>
this world Chocolate milk!  There is the TAC box and  Needle in a <br/>
haystack, thanks Mr. Macnamee and  Flower Garden Project boxes all <br/>
ready  more to come!   Leader of the pack<br/>
