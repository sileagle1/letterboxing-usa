<br/>
     Etiquette, it is all about etiquette! I have<br/>
employed you to find the culprit of a crime; a crime<br/>
of such magnitude, that its very loss is having a<br/>
negative influence on the letterboxing community. <br/>
<br/>
    May I suggest that you concentrate on just what<br/>
the implications of this crime are? The guilty parties<br/>
at this very moment are creating havoc in society. The<br/>
missing Store of Good Manners must be found and<br/>
returned to its proper location! Someone must have<br/>
word that can solve this case!<br/>
<br/>
     Investigator Bacon, have you done your footwork?<br/>
All of your suspects, thus far, have proven themselves<br/>
to be of impeccable character and have presented<br/>
examples of proper etiquette in their search for<br/>
letterboxes. <br/>
<br/>
     Lapse not in the duties for which you were hired.<br/>
The fate of letterboxes everywhere is in your hands.<br/>
The culprit must be found!<br/>
<br/>
     You surely must realize the importance of your<br/>
responsibilities in this matter. I have received your<br/>
latest expense request. Should you really continue the<br/>
search for good manners in clubs?<br/>
<br/>
Truly, <br/>
<br/>
Ms. Emily Post<br/>
<br/>
