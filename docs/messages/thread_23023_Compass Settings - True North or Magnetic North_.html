I think you will find that most folks just line that little 'pointy' <br/>
thing with north and use the degrees as they are shown.<br/>
There have been some clues that indicate that you must use a <br/>
declination, but those are fairly rare.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am one of the people who has used True North, but that's only<br/>
because when I started this hobby, I thought that's what everyone else<br/>
used.  As I've learned, most people use magnetic north so you don't<br/>
have to declinate your compass.<br/>
<br/>
I have considered re-writing any clues I have with compass directions<br/>
so that they reflect magnetic north, but haven't done so yet.  I'd<br/>
recommend if you write clues for the masses, use magnetic north.<br/>
<br/>
When someone reviews my clues from my website, it tells them that any<br/>
compass directions use True North.<br/>

<br/>
I have never seen true north used in either letterboxing or <br/>
competitive orienteering.  In my area, the magnetic deviance is only <br/>
5 deg, so you would have to be traveling a fair distance for it to <br/>
matter.  It is, however, a good thing for the girls to know about <br/>
(especially for those who want to go on to be pilots).<br/>
<br/>
The watch method is also useful in a pinch.  You can teach them to <br/>
hold their watch level and point the hour hand at the sun (they can <br/>
also draw a watch with the correct time on a piece of paper or on the <br/>
ground if they have a digital watch).  Bisect the angle between the <br/>
hour hand and the 12 o'clock mark (or the 1 o'clock mark during <br/>
daylight savings time) to get the north-south line. If there is any <br/>
doubt as to which end of the line is north, remember that the sun is <br/>
in the east before noon and in the west after noon (and due south at <br/>
noon).  I have used this technique when letterboxing without a <br/>
compass (while traveling recently in Texas) and was able to <br/>
extrapolate compass bearings well enough to find the box.  This also <br/>
works fairly well when it's overcast -- if you stick a stick in the <br/>
ground, you usually still get a good enough shadow to figure out <br/>
where the sun is.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and have fun!<br/>
