Your Runaway Kitty has been having a great time. For a while moved from <br/>
one Cemetary to another, got tired of that and shared with many <br/>
letterboxers at the "Haunted Trail,  took a train ride in Windam. got <br/>
off the train in  Lebanon. A long skip and jump and she was in Waterford <br/>
at Jordon Mill where Butterfly gathered her up and has been hugging her <br/>
for a week, not finding a place to her liking. I promise tomorrow, <br/>
Monday, to find the perrrfect place.<br/>
