&gt; I've also wondered if its OK to just put a stamp in there and no log book.<br/>
&gt;  Is this a problem?  I may care less about who's been there (and collecting<br/>
&gt;  stamps for awards) than I do about just providing a "find" for someone.<br/>
&gt;  You know what I mean?  Has anyone else thought about it this way?<br/>
<br/>
Hi, it's me, the compulsive purist, again.  Do I really have to say it... you<br/>
already know what I'm going to say... Oh, well.  Here I go anyway...<br/>
<br/>
I don't like this idea at all.  The most overlooked aspect of Letterboxing in<br/>
our discussions thus far is the practice of jotting a few notes in the book<br/>
when you visit.  It's not ALL about the stamps... it's also about<br/>
communication.  The stamps are just our signatures.  When you send someone a<br/>
letter, you don't just sign a piece of paper and mail it to someone (well,<br/>
unless you're a celebrity, I guess)  Without the book, you don't have a<br/>
LETTERbox... you just have a box with a stamp in it.<br/>
