Black Hill Regional Park, <br/>
Central Maryland<br/>
Placed 17 August 2002<br/>
by two gray squirrels<br/>
Easy<br/>
<br/>
Enter park, Pass visitors center, Turn right on the second entrance Picnic Lane Park in the first lot on right.  (Or go in the first entrance to Picnic Lane and park in the last lot on the left).<br/>
<br/>
You must go into the woods on the black top trail,<br/>
this one isn't for the weak and frail.<br/>
Pass the circle body onto the steps of 4.<br/>
Keep going there's more.<br/>
<br/>
Hope over the logs and turn left between the orange <br/>
You must go toward the lake, for that's what it will take. <br/>
Look for the deer, geese and racoon tracks on the shore,<br/>
it's fun but has nothing to do with what's in store.<br/>
Follow the left woodland path along the bank, <br/>
for this you have Squirrel to thank.<br/>
