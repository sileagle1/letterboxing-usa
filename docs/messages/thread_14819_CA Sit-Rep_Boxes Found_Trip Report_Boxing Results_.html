clues) to get the Castaways Curlew box.  I can't believe I had looked around<br/>

<br/>
On Saturday, my son (Osiris) and I hit up the LA County Arboretum and Eaton<br/>
Canyon.  Results are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
LA County Arboretum Box - Alive and kicking<br/>
<br/>
Succulent Box - Non-conclusive.  There were spies in the area.  One of them<br/>
commented that we had left and come back.  I hid the body in the lake.  The log<br/>
for the Arboretum box said that the box was there but there was no stamp or ink<br/>
pad.  I was unable to get to the box to find out.  I will have to try again later.<br/>
<br/>
Eaton Canyon Hummingbird - Flew the coop!  The hole under the tree was empty.  I<br/>
even pulled out a flashlight to check the dark corners.  There is another<br/>
opening at the bottom end of the hole.  I believe the box may have washed out<br/>
through this hole.  I had found this one before so I know I had the right spot.<br/>
 It is definitely gone.<br/>
<br/>
We started on the 'Other Canyons' series in reverse order since we were coming<br/>
out of the canyon after not finding the hummingbird.<br/>
<br/>
Walnut Canyon - Alive and kicking.  If you are looking for a bit more of a<br/>
physical challenge without having to put yourself in danger, this one is for<br/>
you.  There is some definite bushwhacking going as you head up the streambed. <br/>
It also helps to know what a eucalyptus looks like.  I almost tried climbing a<br/>
vertical cliff to check a tree (at least, it looked vertical from the bottom). <br/>
We were only the second people to sign in since May.  If you're looking for<br/>
almost virgin territory, this is it!<br/>
<br/>
Prohibited Box (in Eaton Canyon) - Also alive and kicking.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, Osiris' whining had gotten to me.  He must have said "We'll never<br/>
find the Walnut box.  Let's go back." about 50 times before we finally found<br/>
it!!!  Seeing that the clues for the other two boxes were more of the same and<br/>
realizing that I couldn't stand to hear that another 100 times, I called it a day.<br/>

Thank you for the report on my boxes.  I just left a post that <br/>
confirms the Los Angeles County Arboretum Succulent Letterbox is, <br/>
indeed, missing (thank-you to Purple Iris).  I couldn't look for <br/>
letterboxes today, and wandered up to Eaton Canyon to check on my <br/>
boxes.  My Meadows and Coyote Canyon letterboxes are still in place <br/>
(which you did not find, per the all too understandible grumblings of <br/>
your son), as well as the Walnut Canyon and other LB mentioned in <br/>
your post--you've got a great stamp!  You reported that the Eaton <br/>
Hummingbird was missing, and I assume you also checked on the Eaton <br/>
Canyon Letterbox, which you've adopted, and which was the first LB I <br/>
ever found, but if you didn't, I checked on it today, and it's in <br/>
great shape--last visited on May 17th by Jelly, of Jam &amp; Jelly fame.<br/>
