Sorry to break the news, but you'll be at least third to come up with this<br/>
idea. A few months ago, I did the same thing (except I glued the pages<br/>
together instead of sewing them) &amp; just recently got permission to place it<br/>
in a local library &amp; posted the clues. I made a new cover for it that says<br/>
it's "The Letterboxing Book" (even included my 'bio' in an "about the<br/>
author" section on the back) &amp; added pages to the front that explain about<br/>
letterboxing. It's tied closed with a piece of ribbon that is glued to the<br/>
cover as decoration too. To see the fancy stamp that I am very proud of (&amp;<br/>
the clues), you can go to my website at www.DogScoutsboxes.com I knew it had<br/>
to go in a book related place! Since it's so new, it hasn't been stamped<br/>
into yet, so please visit!<br/>

Well, shoot, man--that's what I've got on my desk right now, waiting to be<br/>
delivered to a bookstore here in Portland, OR.  My book is not NEARLY as<br/>
fancy/clever as yours, tho.  I won't be sneaking it in tho--I know the<br/>
bookstore owner and got her permission to do this before I even began<br/>
carving<br/>
the stamp.  I've been planning this book-box for many weeks but was<br/>
interrupted by regular life--but it's ready to go &amp; I'll be dropping it<br/>
ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And here I thought I was so darn clever, and I'd be the first to do this....<br/>

That's pretty cool!  =)  I didn't want to alter the outside of my <br/>
book, but I love the concept.  "The Letterboxing Book" is a great <br/>
addition, but I delibrately needed the book in a low-traffic area of <br/>
the bookstore (relatively speaking, at least) so I needed a book that <br/>
is supposed to go in that section.  It can't look out of place if I <br/>
wanted to make sure nobody found it (or moved it)!<br/>

I can imagine hundreds of bookstores around the country suddenly <br/>
filling up with letterboxes because of this thread.  =)<br/>
