<div>2 boxes at Louisville , Ky.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Rated Easy , lets get families out finding them 
here too.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Planted by the Stearns Family of the 
Cock-A-Doodle-Moo 4-H Club</div>

<div>In Louisville there is a beautiful park designed 
by Frederick Law Olmstead. He is famous for his design of Central Park, N.Y. and 
many others. The park is Cherokee Park. Access the park by taking Eastern 
Parkway from the highway  to the park entrance.</div>
<div>   Follow the park's scenic loop by 
car to a pointed park pavillion . Hereyou leave your car at the roadside parking 
spaces.  Enter the trail behind spitting turtles. As you leave the turtles 
travel down the leaf strewn path  at a T in the trail go left , onto a 
smaller trail. You will have a view of the  small stream go on.  You 
take the high road and I'll take the low road  .....and instead of Scotland 
we come together again. I chose the low road. </div>
<div>   At the cross paths go left and 
immediatley right. Next comes a Y in the path ( see the  road to bridge on 
the right)  GO left. then straight at the next junction under some trailing 
grape vines you go. </div>
<div>  While white arrows say left you should go 
right. Step onto a small people only bridge. Look for R.C. your box is behind 
that, gaurded by cement. If you  followed this well you will find  a 
Horse of Course.  Stamp secretly the park is a bustling place , we were 
seen but by a pair of dogs!</div>
<div>      Return  
across the bridge and strsaight up the hill to the motor road. At the road turn 
left to return to your car. The road is one way .</div>
<div> </div>
<div>     Follow the motor  
road called scenic loop to intersection with Park Boundry road. Turn Right. 
Follow about 1 mile it twists and turns go slow here. When you see a bridge over 
a shallow river and a children's playground  to the left go there and cross 
the bridge. </div>
<div>   Park in the gravel parking lot. 
There is a walking path along the back corner  stretching away with shale 
type cliffs to the right. </div>
<div>  In the morning the sun will rise to the 
left over the stream.  Folow this sunny morning trail to the Y in trail 
keep to the right, under the ceder tree that leans and on. </div>
<div>   At the clearing spy a large dead 
tree opposite the trail opening. The Sunrise letterbox in wedged in the cleft of 
the three trunks as they lay rotting on the ground. Be careful  that you 
are not seen. Take the box away a bit to stamp then discreetly hide it again in 
the same location.  We enjoyed hiding these for you while we attended 
the  National FFA Convention 2000. FFA is the organiztion promoting 
Agriculture Education to its 450,000 members nationwide. 49,000 attended the 
convention.  Good Luck</div></body></html>
