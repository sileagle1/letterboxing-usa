in the rump.<br/>
<br/>
Would you be able to make the changes to the merit badge form fairly soon?<br/>
The changes are listed here: <a href="http://hometown.aol.com/mohmers/myhomepage/business.html">LbNA regalia updates</a> <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't keep asking except I keep getting orders and have used up most of <br/>
my extra badges.<br/>
I've got about 5 checks written out to me for Merit Badge orders that I can't <br/>
fill  and I can't just forward the checks to the embroiderer since they are <br/>
made out to me. And I hate to be responsible  for cashing it , sending the <br/>
money and having to refund when things get lost in the mail - its happened before <br/>
with the other embroiderer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the work you have done &amp; sorry about being a pain.  I know <br/>
lots of stuff has come up for you to deal with lately.<br/>
