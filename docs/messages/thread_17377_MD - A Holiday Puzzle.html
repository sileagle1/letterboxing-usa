hasn't had too many visitors, which is a shame because the hike was just right for <br/>
a winter walk, and the stamps were terrific!  We noticed that Knitwit Mom and <br/>
Puppy Boy had been there earlier in the day.  As we were looking for the last <br/>
box, checking out every downed tree to see if it had fungi and twists, someone <br/>
called out to us, "If you're looking for what I think you're looking for, <br/>
it's farther down the trail."  We asked if by any chance she was a nitwit?  (Boy, <br/>
it would have been rude if she weren't!)  It was Knitwit Mom and Puppy Boy!  <br/>
We had fun exchanging stamps and holiday greetings.  Happy New Year to all!  D <br/>
and Shoo<br/>
