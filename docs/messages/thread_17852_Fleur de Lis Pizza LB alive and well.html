of 2/16/2004!<br/>
<br/>
So only one of my boxes is missing - The "Old One".  I planted it <br/>
before cold weather hit, not realizing that the spot was one that <br/>
would be used by homeless people as shelter during the freeze we <br/>
had.  I hope the finder was able to make use of at least the ziploc <br/>
bags and the container.<br/>
