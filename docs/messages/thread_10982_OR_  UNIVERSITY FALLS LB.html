<br/>
John and I headed out to the Tillamook State Forest yesterday to hunt<br/>
for the University Falls Letterbox placed by Ryan.  We wanted Brown's<br/>
Camp, also, but the GPS didn't have fresh batteries and we didn't have<br/>
the topo map.  Funhog informed us that a GPS is not necessary but for<br/>
future Brown's Camp hunting the map is a must.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...We didn't do the LONG 8-mile loop.  We drove straight up to the<br/>
University Falls Trailhead and made it a minor 2-mile round trip hike<br/>
instead and successfully found Porky!  <br/>
<br/>
This waterfall is magnificent!!!  The letterbox is wonderful.  Ryan<br/>
carved a fantastic stamp.  Porky was happy to see us.  However, he has<br/>
been there so long without ANY visitors (it was placed on 9/11/01 - very<br/>
sobering to know that) that he wants to stay happy where he is, but<br/>
hopes others will come say hi and stamp in!  He's worth getting.<br/>
<br/>
Just a note:  If you're looking for a peaceful walk in the woods this<br/>
ain't gonna be it, folks.  This area is multi-use and is shared by<br/>
hikers, equestrians, dirt bikes, motorcycles and ATVs.  No motorized<br/>
vehicles are allowed on the trail itself, though, so you won't be<br/>
runover by motocrossers.  You'll hear them now and then, though if you<br/>
hike on the weekends.  Don't let this stop you, though.  The rewards are<br/>
worth it! University Falls is a sight to behold and Ryan's stamp will<br/>
make you smile.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
