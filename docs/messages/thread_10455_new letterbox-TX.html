National Wildlife Refuge Tivoli, Aransas County, Texas. This refuge is the<br/>
one place in the United States where you are almost guaranteed to see<br/>
Whooping Cranes. During the winter months, North America's tallest birds<br/>
leave their breeding grounds in Canada and come here to feast on blue crabs<br/>
and shellfish, culinary delights you can also enjoy during your travels<br/>
along the Gulf Coast.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: The refuge is located off Highway 35 about 65 miles<br/>
northeast of Corpus Christi. The turnoff is well-marked with a brown sign.<br/>
Once inside the refuge, stop at the Visitor Center to pay the entry fee and<br/>
get a map.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: Park at the Hog Lake Trailhead. Walk the trail until you<br/>
reach the Wetlands pier. Where board meets tarmac walk at 122 degrees until<br/>
tarmac ends. Stroll along the grassy verge for 33 Steps at 200 degrees.<br/>
Across the clearing, 22 steps at 132 degrees should bring you to the<br/>
smaller of two neighboring stumps, home to this North/South traveler.<br/>
Note: Although Whooping Cranes are very territorial, Silver Eagle's Aransas<br/>
Whooper lives close at hand. Visit them both!<br/>
