<p>Planted 2-14-03<br/>By : Leader of the Pack and Pink Trotters <br/>Location: 
Owen’s Mere at the corner of Rte 275 &amp; Seperatist Rd, in Mansfield, Ct. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/ma/queen.htm">Queen of Hearts</a> is 
  in this Park be sure to bring clues to that one too!</li></ul>
<p>Park just outside the gate and as much to one side as to leave a fire lane 
access to the water. This park is owned by Joshua’s Trust ; preserving the land 
of Joshua son of the Satchem Uncas. <br/><br/>Walk around the gate and walk across 
the dam to your right. You come to the brook that flows out of the pond. 
Carefully use the stepping stones to cross. Follow the path to the junction of 
the yellow trail near the bench. Take 36 paces ( count one foot only) up the 
yellow trail. Look to your left for a large forked tree. Cupid is behind the 
tree in a nest of sticks. Cupid has a “parasite” box , a parasite is dependent 
on its host for its needs. So this parasite box is. No ink, no log just the 
stamp that goes with and needs Cupid. So once you have found Cupid proceed up 
the trail past the next yellow blaze then look right for a standing hollow log. 
Cupid’s Parasite can be found here. Use the ink from Cupid and collect both 
images. Return to their own containers and seal well before re-hiding in their 
own stick nests. <br/><br/></p></span></span><span class="370244602-28122002">Happy
