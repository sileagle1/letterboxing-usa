Subject: DC: 2 boxes on Roosevelt Island<br/>
<br/>
Both letterboxes are alive and well on Roosevelt Island in<br/>
Washington, DC.  Several people had stamped in them over this<br/>
weekend, and we found them on July 28 in the very hot afternoon.<br/>
The "Roosevelt Island" box is a little crunched and no longer<br/>
waterproof, but the book is in a baggy and seems to have stayed dry.<br/>
<br/>
The "Teddy's Box" book was full, and another letterboxer (not the<br/>
owner) had kindly placed a new book in the box.<br/>

Here are directions &amp; clues to the new Riverbend Park letterbox, placed<br/>
7/29/02.<br/>
Lee Glassco<br/>
<br/>
  ----------<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Musdrat Ramble Letterbox:From I-495, take exit 44 and go 4.6<br/>
miles west on Rte. 193 (Georgetown Pike) to a right on River Bend Rd. Go 2.1<br/>
miles to a right on Jeffery Rd. and 0.9 miles to the Visitors Center<br/>
entrance on the right. Park in the Visitors Center lot. From the parking<br/>
lot, walk straight down the hill past the picnic area toward the river and<br/>
turn left on the dirt path. Follow this parth about 10 minutes to a<br/>
footbridge (there are many side trails from this parth, but stay on the<br/>
main, riverside trail. Do not cross the footbridge; instead, turn left on<br/>
the narrow path by the bridge and walk a few steps to where it turns right<br/>
to cross the creek. Fire up your compass and, on a bearing of 200 degrees,<br/>
walk 25-30 steps to a very tall tree with several large vines climbing its<br/>
trunk. Now, on a bearing of 254 degrees, walk a few steps to a<br/>
double-trunked tree. Muskrat Ramble Letterbox is in a hollow at the base of<br/>
the trunk on the right.<br/>

Subject: Report on NJ letterboxes<br/>
<br/>
On Saturday, I discovered the following letterboxes:<br/>
<br/>
Into the Woods, Hoffman Park -- the box was fine, as was the journal and<br/>
stamp in their plastic bag, but there was moisture inside the box and the<br/>
"about letterboxing" cards were soaked and could use replacing. Also, the<br/>
clues refer to 2 birch stumps, but only one is standing -- the other has<br/>
rotted away completely. The stump where the box is hidden is also rotting<br/>
away quickly. This box is little visited, but the clues should probably be<br/>
slightly revised. (The poison ivy was ubiquitous, but I trod carefully and<br/>
*so far* don't seem to have brought any home with me <g>).<br/>
<br/>
Ken Lockwood Gorge -- in fine shape.<br/>
<br/>
Round Valley -- in good shape, and I picked up the Backpacker Hitchhiker<br/>
there, too. This hitchhiker seems happy to have finally gotten out of New<br/>
England (it had been found multiple times by various 'boxers, including 4<br/>
times by Wanda &amp; Pete) and wants to go further west. I'll be happy to<br/>
oblige <g>.<br/>

<br/>
The Little Devil Downpour Lettterbox was placed Saturday,<br/>
July 27th, in Shenandoah National Park in Warren County,<br/>
Virginia, by Dan Rinzel and Christine Chumbler.<br/>
<br/>
Find the Cemetery on the trail at skyline mile 19.<br/>
Walk uphill to the first yellow blaze.<br/>
Beyond it, about 50 yards, a pile of rocks<br/>
visible to the left of the trail. You will need<br/>
to look carefully at the pile. If you reach the<br/>
second yellow blaze, you went too far.<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is also a bookcrossing zone.<br/>
( see http://dan2bit.bookcrossing.com ) If you<br/>
find the book, please take it with you. If you<br/>
want to leave a small paperback, register it<br/>
with bookcrossing.com and keep the relay going.<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox could probably use a slightly bigger<br/>
container (half gallon size, maybe?) if the kind soul who<br/>
finds it has such an item.<br/>
<br/>
It's our first effort, so feedback is appreciated.<br/>
A copy of these clues is posted at<br/>
http://2-bit.com/letterbox<br/>

Thanks!<br/>

Yeah, another letterbox in Summit County!!!  I just returned from my<br/>
parents house in Dillon where my mom and I went on our first letterbox<br/>
hunt on the 11-7 trail on Keystone Mountain.  Unfortunately, it wasn't<br/>

&gt; The Peninsula Letterbox<br/>
&gt; Location: Frisco CO, Summit county<br/>
&gt; Placed: July 25, 2002<br/>
&gt; By: The Brown Knight<br/>
&gt; Difficulty: Kid friendly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; An area of land in Frisco is referred to by the locals as The<br/>
&gt; Peninsula. White River National Forest is on part of The Peninsula,<br/>
&gt; but the letterbox is located outside of the gate on city property so<br/>
&gt; as to "leave no trace". From Main St. and Summit Blvd. in Frisco take<br/>
&gt; Highway 9 south. After about a half mile, you'll pass the Frisco<br/>
&gt; Nordic Center on your left. The next turnoff on your left is the one<br/>
&gt; you take and it has a sign which says, "Peak One / Pine Cove<br/>
&gt; Campgrounds, White River National Forest". It's about a mile from the<br/>
&gt; Main St. and Summit Blvd. intersection. Soon after you turn in,<br/>
&gt; you'll see a sign which says, "Campground Boat Ramp" pointing left.<br/>
&gt; Don't take this road. Instead take the gravel road to the right and<br/>
&gt; drive about a quarter mile to a locked gate and park on the side of<br/>
&gt; the road. From the center of the gate at a heading of 175 degrees<br/>
&gt; lies a 3 ft. high round boulder which blocks a dirt road. Walk down<br/>
&gt; this dirt road. You'll pass some large flat rocks on your right. At<br/>
&gt; the first "intersection" take the path heading right due NE up a<br/>
&gt; slope. At the next "intersection" at the top of the slope, follow the<br/>
&gt; path left due N. Take 30-35 steps and on your right is a small 1 ft.<br/>
&gt; high, cubed-shaped rock that is perfect for stamping in. From this<br/>
&gt; rock at about 85 degrees, take about 15 steps and you'll see a half-<br/>
&gt; buried, lichen-covered rock with about one-eighth of it broken off to<br/>
&gt; form a crevasse. Inside this crevasse under smaller rocks is hidden<br/>
&gt; The Peninsula Letterbox.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Save some time to hike beyond the gate where your car is parked. It's<br/>
&gt; two miles to a beautiful view of Lake Dillon.<br/>

Subject: Chicago Letterboxes<br/>
<br/>
Had a great time hunting down our first boxes this weekend while<br/>
visiting the Chicago area -- Chicago Underground and Magic Hedge.<br/>
<br/>
Both boxes are in good condition, with stamps and books intact and<br/>
dry.  Although it was a little harder to find, we were surprised to<br/>
see so few visitors to the Magic Hedge box since it was placed Dec.<br/>
2001.<br/>
<br/>
I purchased the stamp I am using as my personal stamp because I was<br/>
anxious to get started and found the 'perfect' stamp.  Am now working<br/>
on carving my first stamp, a hitch hiker to be planted on our next<br/>
hunt.  Also putting together a few ideas for boxes of our own, to be<br/>
placed in the West Michigan area.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the great info here and on member sites around the web!<br/>

Subject: clue for a new letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Thompson Creek Trail Letterbox #1<br/>
<br/>
This box is in Claremont, California in Eastern Los Angeles County.<br/>
I placed it July 28, 2002.<br/>
<br/>
The Thompson Creek Trail runs adjacent to the Thompson Creek flood<br/>
control channel along the base of the foothills.  For this<br/>
letterbox,  you can best access the trail from  Indian Hill Blvd. or<br/>
from Towne Avenue.  Both these streets intersect Foothill Blvd the<br/>
old Route 66), Baseline Road and finally the trail.   From Towne Ave,<br/>
you will want to walk east,  with the mountains on your left. From<br/>
Indian Hill Blvd,  you will want to walk west with the mountains on<br/>
your right.  The box is on the trail between these two access<br/>
points.  Look for a marking like this:<br/>
<br/>
                  241 + 00<br/>
                    SBM<br/>
                   6" vent<br/>
                  100 &gt;<br/>
                 241 + ~ 698<br/>
                      7<br/>
<br/>
Standing on the trail, with your back to this marking, go forward 30<br/>
paces to the back of the clearing.  Turn left and go 39 paces to a<br/>
tree on your right.  The base of this tree is surrounded by<br/>
shrubbery.  The box is hidden in the rocks at the base of the tree.<br/>
Be careful not to disturb the irrigation system.<br/>

For the life of me, I can't remember if there's another way to get in<br/>
touch with y'all, so forgive me.<br/>
<br/>
The Ravenna Park clues for Seattle, WA, have changed just slightly.<br/>
They up and moved the picnic table mentioned.  Just go straight through<br/>
the clearing (the clues are fine without the table, but if people are<br/>
looking for it, they may think they're not on the right track when they<br/>
are.).<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yahoo Groups, I wonder if there is a digest mode, where I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; receive the<br/>
&gt; &gt; email messages of the day (or other time period) in a batch,<br/>
&gt; &gt; rather than one<br/>
&gt; &gt; at a time, as they are sent?<br/>
<br/>
When I signed up to be a member of this group on Yahoo!, I was asked<br/>
if I wanted e-mails daily, in digest form (many e-mails in one<br/>
massive e-mail), or not at all. You can set up these preferences by<br/>
clicking on "Edit Your Membership" on the Groups area of Yahoo!. Hope<br/>
this helps.<br/>
