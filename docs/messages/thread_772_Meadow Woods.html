                    <div class="plaintext-content">Meadow Woods is a quietly satisfying park that is  Nature Conservancy<br/>
and  Town of Essex. So far, there is one letterbox on an extensive,<br/>
well marked trail system. Figure a long hour and 2 miles for this<br/>
hike. Sorry, no mountain bikes.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: On Connecticut Rte. 9, take exit 3 and follow the Essex<br/>
signs along West Ave. Turn left on Grove St at the library, then left<br/>
again onto North Main St. After about  mile, turn left on Book Hill<br/>
and after another  mile, left on Book Hill Woods Rd. Park at the end<br/>
in the cul de sac next to the sign for the Meadow Woods Park.<br/>
<br/>
Pick up an excellent map in the mailbox at the trail head, and then<br/>
hike in on the green blazed Long Trail for a counterclockwise<br/>
south-to-north loop. Walk up a steep slope and over a small bridge to<br/>
fork left with the green trail. Follow the Long Trail past a silver<br/>
crossover on the right and the orange Hill Trail on your left. Turn<br/>
right (west) on a white blazed crossover trail towards<br/>
Castle Rock, then shortly right again onto the orange blazed Castle<br/>
Rock Trail. Hike along southwards with a ridge line to your left<br/>
(east), which is Castle Rock. Just before the trail drops down to a<br/>
yellow intersection, scramble up the end of the ridge. Bushwack 20<br/>
steps east to a chest-high roundish boulder: the Castle Rock Letterbox<br/>
is against the rock on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Continue south on the orange, and then turn right at the yellow blazed<br/>
Eagle Rock Trail. Follow it around behind houses and down into a steep<br/>
valley before regaining the orange Castle Rock Trail. Turn right and<br/>
cross a small bridge to the blue blazed Canfield Trail. Turn left for a<br/>
straight shot north, back to the trailhead.<br/>
