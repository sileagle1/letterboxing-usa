                    <html><body><div>This box was placed on 1/16/2003</div> <div>By JustBeth</div> <div> </div> <div>It is at beautiful Hop Brook Lake you might want to check out the websight during the spring and summer to see what this park offers, as this is a wonderful place to spend a day with the family or just alone. This park also happens to be pooch friendly, so long as they are leashed.</div> <div>I hope to plant more boxes here in the up coming months. I had learned that there is now a fee to enter the park from Memorial Day to Labor Day. So keep that in mind when you go. However this box is accessible quite easily by foot even when the park is closed. </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div>Hop Brook Lake</div> <div>Route 63 / Straits Turnpike</div> <div>Middlebury, CT</div> <div>This is a quick easy hike for all.</div> <div> </div> <div>Enter park when you see a sign the reads "Recreation Area"</div> <div>park in that top lot and walk down just past the guard house.</div> <div>On your right you will see a gate with a "no parking" sign on it.</div> <div>Follow that trail past the big boulder until you see a "no swimming" sign. (Really it's a fun place)</div> <div>Follow the stream in a SE direction (or left for us compassely challenged folks)</div> <div>along a lovely stone wall.</div> <div>When you come to a set of steps in the wall you have approximately 10 more paces (to a count of left, right, left)</div> <div>Hidden in the wall behind what will be a blooming bush in the spring is the treasure you seek.</div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div>This was my first "solo" letterbox. It's been a healing of sorts for me. I hope you all enjoy.</div> <div>Mike suggested we start a singles letterboxing group...anyone interested?</div> <div> </div> <div>~JustBeth<br/><br/></div></body></html>
