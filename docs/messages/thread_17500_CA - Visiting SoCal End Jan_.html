I highly recommend going to Torrey Pines State Reserve in <br/>
San Diego for my San Diego Sails online box.  The letterbox<br/>
went missing but if you walk the beautiful trail described<br/>
in my clues you can justify downloading the stamp image to<br/>
print and paste in your logbook as a Find.  You can also<br/>
make an entry to my online logbook instead of a physical one.<br/>
Even without a letterbox to look for, this place is special.<br/>
Sounds like a fun trip; have fun!<br/>

In the Los Angeles area (California area 7 on the LBNA map), there <br/>
are some great boxes that meet your requirements for a short hike,  <br/>
short visit, and are child friendly.  I'm recommending boxes that I <br/>
believe are still in place, and/or are multiple series (for <br/>
maximum "F" counts), and/or are quick drive-bys.  <br/>
<br/>
There are so many great boxes in Los Angeles County--cleverly hidden, <br/>
in beautiful locations--that I hope not to offend other SoCal placers <br/>
by not suggesting their boxes; I'm just trying to put together a list <br/>
of a few boxes that I know about that have maximum box gain with <br/>
minimum effort--boxes I consider that can be successfully hit by a <br/>
travelling family.  <br/>
<br/>
Here they go:<br/>
El Dorado Series--five great stamps by Don &amp; Gwen, all in a big, <br/>
beautiful park (you'll have to pay five or six dollars for parking).<br/>
<br/>
The Halloween Series--five stamps carved by me located around the <br/>
city of Pasadena (there were six, but one is missing at the moment). <br/>
Consider whether the macabre settings are appropriate for your <br/>
youngest. Doughnut, a stellar SoCal letterboxer, whom you may have <br/>
met, along with her tribe, at the SLO Gathering, took her similarly-<br/>
aged children on the series, and found ways to get around the scarey-<br/>
factor.<br/>
<br/>
Pasadena Humane Society--a quick drive-by box at the Pasadena Animal <br/>
Shelter (the Dog Pound).  This LB is located outside the animal <br/>
shelter, so the shelter doesn't have to be open for you to retrieve <br/>
it. I warn you, if you go during visiting hours, you will come home <br/>
with a dog.<br/>
<br/>
Swimming in Sierra Madre--another fairly quick box with a great <br/>
stamp.  This is where I dropped off your "Halloween Witch" HH, which <br/>
was given to me by Ash Raven at the SLO Gathering.  Your HH has since <br/>
been picked up by Jam &amp; Jelly, two other stellar SoCal letterboxers.  <br/>
This box happens to be located next door to my Halloween Series Ghost <br/>
letterbox, so if you do that series, pick this LB up as well.<br/>
<br/>
The Strange Stamp Series at Heritage Park--three great stamps carved <br/>
by Jam &amp; Jelly, in a great park with lots of SoCal history, with very <br/>
short (civilized) hiking.<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice trip in SoCal.  At the SLO Gathering, I didn't get your <br/>
stamp in my stampbook--that one picnic table was so full I could <br/>
never get a seat.<br/>

can be busy there, so be discreet.<br/>

I also found the shelter island box, but the one in Old San Diego, <br/>
I believe is missing.  I found the cactus leaf with a name carved <br/>
on it, but there was no letterbox.  Even if you don't have a box, you <br/>

<br/>
I'll just jump in with a few ideas of my own for your vacation.  Don<br/>
mentioned our Swimming in Sierra Madre box.  It's easy, but not very<br/>
spectacular.  <br/>
<br/>
In area 7<br/>
<br/>
Our Biking in Lacy Park, San Marino is a little farther to get to, but<br/>
if you're bringing the kids' bikes, they can ride around a little.<br/>
<br/>
Descanso Gardens in La Canada has 3 boxes, plus a bonus box.  There is<br/>
an entrance fee, but if you are a member at a botanical garden or<br/>
arboretum they may have a reciprocal agreement.  The Gardens feel like<br/>
walking through the woods on a paved path, or in one case a dirt path<br/>
through the oaks.  The walk is easy, the clues were a little hard to<br/>
follow, but we managed to come up with them all.  If you go on a<br/>
weekend they have a small train ride.  http://www.descansogardens.org/<br/>
<br/>
The Los Angeles Arboretum, Arcadia has two boxes.  It also has an<br/>
entrance fee, but they have reciprocal agreements with other<br/>
arboretums and gardens.  It's located close to the freeway, easy to<br/>
get to.  It's one of the few places in L.A. that the kids can stretch<br/>
their legs and run around a little bit. http://www.arboretum.org/<br/>
<br/>
The Millard Falls box in Pasadena has a great California Hike feel,<br/>
but is relatively flat and not too long for kids.  Parking requires an<br/>
Adventure Pass but the campground keeper says they don't check very<br/>
often. Your Mileage May Very.  I took 4 kids ages 2 to 8 and they had<br/>
a great time.  Yes, there are a lot of boulders, but I didn't see any<br/>
Poison Oak, a plus around here.<br/>
<br/>
In area 8<br/>
<br/>
Calico Ghost town would be fun for the kids.  I took my kids before we<br/>
started letterboxing so I can't tell you about the boxes there.  They<br/>
are listed under Barstow ; Ryan's Great Grandpappy and Calico.  The<br/>
Calico clues say that its missing.  The suggestion to eat at Peggy<br/>
Sue's diner is a good one.  http://www.calicotown.com/<br/>
<br/>
Have a Great Vacation, (Hope you haven't left yet!)<br/>
