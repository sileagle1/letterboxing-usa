found 5 of the Gazebo Series, I'd already found the roof. Baltic has <br/>
the only wheel chair accessible gazebo and we had a lovely time just <br/>
sitting there. I guess we were lucky because all 5 were people free <br/>
while we were stamping.<br/>
All scroll's are pretty full and Andover's had fallen to the floor. I <br/>
reattached it but don't know if it will hold. The people of Andover <br/>
must be pretty special to just let it lie there undisturbed.<br/>
Sadie and Russ mentioned that theirs was cockeyed but I'll bet I have <br/>
them beat (grin). We should have a Gazebo Gathering to compare stamps <br/>
(grin again).<br/>
