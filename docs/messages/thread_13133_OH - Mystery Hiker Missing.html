<br/>
I was informed by some people who were looking for John's Mystery <br/>
Hiker in John Bryan Park that it was missing.  I went for a hike a <br/>
couple days ago, and it is definately AWOL.  The board it had been <br/>
hidden under was moved.  No box, no bag, no stamp... nothing.<br/>
<br/>
It was a great box and will be missed.  With Franzsolo's agreement, I <br/>
would suggest the box be deleted. <br/>
