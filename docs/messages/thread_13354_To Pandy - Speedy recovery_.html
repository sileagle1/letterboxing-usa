                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dear Pandy -- Let us add our sympathy and hopes for your speedy recovery!  <br/>
We've caught "the fever" too and kept going on in search of a  box as it was <br/>
getting dark and cold!  That was our infamous Froggy adventure!  Luckily no <br/>
one got hurt, but, we had two little children that we really stopped <br/>
thinking about.  Da and I really learned our lesson that evening!!  Don't <br/>
feel foolish because it has happened to so many people!  We gained a great <br/>
respect for nature that day as well as an additional ten pounds or so in the <br/>
backpack!  (added flashlight, water, mylar blanket, etc.)  You should go <br/>
shopping at the nearest sports/outdoors store.  The section of cool little <br/>
gizmos that you can add to your pack is great.  Most of them are pretty <br/>
cheap and the added security that the first aid kit etc. gives you is great <br/>
too!<br/>
<br/>
Having learned the hard way, Da and I now prepare for our forays a little <br/>
better!  We always try and get a trail map either off the net or at a <br/>
visitor's center.  That day we had not a clue as to where we were or how far <br/>
from the lot etc.  (of course, we did the same stupid thing almost at the <br/>
Scooby boxes even after we swore we would never head out without a map <br/>
again).  The trail map may also indicate the terrain.<br/>
<br/>
We try and read the clues carefully and email the box placer or other boxer <br/>
friends if we have any questions.  There are several families with young <br/>
children in the DC area.  I think we are good about "warning" eachother <br/>
concerning boxes that are tough or very far (it can be very hard to tell by <br/>
the clues.  Some people list every rock and tree you pass -- that's us -- <br/>
and others will let you walk for a mile without a benchmark).  We are also <br/>
quick to recommend child-friendly boxes to each other or offer shortcuts or <br/>
hints.  Perhaps you can hook up with a group of similar skills and desires <br/>
(the old easy versus hard trails, complicated versus straight-forward <br/>
clues...).  You all can advise each other.<br/>
<br/>
Again - we are glad that you survived your ordeal.  It sounds like you are a <br/>
very courageous individual!  Take care of yourself!  BeMa<br/>
