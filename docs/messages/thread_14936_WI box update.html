issues with a couple of my series:<br/>
<br/>
Triangles, Triangles Everywhere - the last box was moved to an easier<br/>
location, but I haven't had the chance to put the new clues in the second<br/>
box yet, so the clues there lead you to the right park, but the wrong<br/>
location of the box.  This should be fixed sometime next week.<br/>
<br/>
Oak Leaf Series - the second box in Estabrook Park has been reported<br/>
missing.  This too should be fixed sometime next week.<br/>
<br/>
Bristol Series - Just a reminder that The Hard Core Trad Stamp clues have<br/>
changed since the band's run at Bristol is over.  If you can't catch Rua at<br/>
Bristol, you might try Irishfest on Saturday 8/16 at 5:00<br/>
(www.wakingmaggie.com)! <shameless plug=""> All the other boxes are available.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this doesn't cause any problems!<br/>
