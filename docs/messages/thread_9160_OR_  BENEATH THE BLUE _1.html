for Lincoln City to nab Beneath the Blue #1 at Drift Creek Falls.  When<br/>
I was last on this trail in the mid-90's they were still building it,<br/>
but now, I'm happy to report it is fabulously finished!!!<br/>
<br/>
THIS LETTERBOX IS NOT TO BE MISSED!  I can't believe we were the first<br/>
to stamp in.  The hike is excellent, the place itself (especially once<br/>
you get to the spectacular bridge) is remarkable, and we can't rave on<br/>
enough about the beautiful stamp that Funhog carved for this letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
This is a wonderful 3-mile roundtrip hike.  We saw rough-skinned newts<br/>
and a very large brown frog while on the trail.  What a delightful day!  <br/>
<br/>
THANKS TO FUNHOG FOR THE INCENTIVE TO CHECK OUT THIS BEAUTIFUL PLACE!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
