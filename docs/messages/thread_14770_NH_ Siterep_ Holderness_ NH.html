After placing this box on a small island in Squam Lake 13 months ago, I had the opportunity this morning to check on it for the first time.  Not only had no one stamped into it since its planting, the only person I know of that tried to find it failed miserably (he was trying it by memory and without a compass, however).  <br/>
<br/>
This is all just as well, I suppose, because the box was completely full of water and the journal was soaked.  This happened in spite of the fact that I double zip-lock bagged the contents inside a premium (or so I thought) Rubbermaid container (the one with the blue rubbery seal around the plastic top).  Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
I will note on the clue that this box will be out of commission for a little while, so those of you who were planning on snagging this one soon--you'll just have to wait a little longer.<br/>
