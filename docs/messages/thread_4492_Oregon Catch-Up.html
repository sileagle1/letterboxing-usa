<br/>
If you could, please, completely remove the clues for the Columbia River<br/>
Slough Series.  Placed by Amanda Briles the Paisley Orca in August 2000.<br/>
State of Oregon, Portland area, Multnomah County.  It's not on a link,<br/>
but it's on the website.  Only one box remains.  The rest of the<br/>
letterboxes in this series will be replaced, but with new clues and on<br/>
trails instead of water.  <br/>
<br/>
Also...Please remove clues entirely of the Van Duzer Corridor in Oregon<br/>
near Lincoln City, Central Coast, Lincoln County.  I think it was placed<br/>
maybe April of last year???  This box is still there but the clues are<br/>
funky as all get out and no one will ever find this box as it stands.<br/>
Its stamp was carved by me, Amanda Briles, The Paisley Orca, and was<br/>
placed by the love of my life, John, or jmaronieh, as he signs in at<br/>
letterboxes.  We are hoping to get to that part of Oregon again in the<br/>
spring to put it in a different spot and make the ever-so-vague clues<br/>
less frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help on this.  We really appreciate it.  Sometimes life<br/>
gets in the way and people have to switch priorities and maybe that's<br/>
what's going on with our West Coast Webmaster.  After all, you folks do<br/>
maintain this site out of the goodness of your hearts and we're thankful<br/>
for any time and effort you're able to give.   <br/>
<br/>
It will be nice to have the map updated again so we don't have to play<br/>
archeologists and dig through the archives or try to remember what was<br/>
new which month.  We really appreciate your help.  There's been a lot of<br/>
letterboxing activity out here lately and no one should get discouraged<br/>
just because their clues aren't posted.  <br/>
<br/>
Also...there are two letterboxes that were placed in New Zealand late<br/>
last year in October by Mark and Beth Bendickson and by John and myself<br/>
in December 2001.  Both are on the South Island. Theirs in Christchurch<br/>
and ours in Kaikoura.  How does that work?  Maybe a hot spot for<br/>
international aside from North America can be created???  Ryan placed<br/>
some in Africa last year also, so those need to go somewhere, though he<br/>
has a link to them.  This sport is growing leaps and bounds way beyond<br/>
Dartmoor and North American borders.  Aint it fun!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
