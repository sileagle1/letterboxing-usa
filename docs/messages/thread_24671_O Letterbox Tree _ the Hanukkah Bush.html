Seattle and are phenomenally carved by South Hill Hendersons and<br/>
Triple T. They represent Hanukkah traditions.<br/>
<br/>
Since Hanukkah begins on December 5th this year, they will be<br/>
available from that date on in or under the Hanukkah Bush located<br/>
between the menorah and dreidel window ornaments and will remain in<br/>
place through January 1st. O Letterbox Tree clues will be posted on<br/>
December 10th and will remain letterbox-decorated through January 1st. <br/>

2007 O Letterbox Tree &amp; the Hanukkah Bush<br/>
The possibility of ocean-effect snow flurries are showing up in our<br/>
local weather forecasts, a sure sign that the time has come to think<br/>
about O Letterbox Tree &amp; the Chanukah Bush once again. We decided to<br/>
give this year's series a theme, a way of getting to know each other<br/>
better: holiday traditions from our families or heritage. We will have<br/>
both our letterboxing Christmas tree decorated and our Chanukah bush<br/>
under the light-up dreidel and menorah ready on the weekend after<br/>
Thanksgiving.<br/>
