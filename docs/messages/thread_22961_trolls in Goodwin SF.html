there that you could give the box a face lift?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well before I decide whether I will give the box a face lift, I need <br/>
to know if it ok! the last time i had was going to do something with <br/>
something that didn't belong to me, I got my head chewed off. I know <br/>
that people as well as I, travel along with plastic bags for repairs <br/>
to boxes, but this box needs everything. it needs a new log book. <br/>
the only thing that can be saved is the stamp. so before i decide to <br/>
do anything, i want to know if it is ok to repair/replace <br/>
everything/anything. i will be back in that area around January 6th. <br/>
I have supplies to repair and im willing to do so if acceptable.<br/>
