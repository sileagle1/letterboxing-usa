                    <div class="plaintext-content">Saturday seemed like a good day to be out.  No rain, occasional blue sky...<br/>
I loaded up 2 likely accomplices and we headed out.   First stop was the<br/>
Nature Park to confirm our April 28th gig.  We checked box #1 to see if the<br/>
park staff had replaced it.  They had &amp; Amanda had been by to stamp up.  We<br/>
quickly checked box#4 and also found it in good condition and with a new<br/>
stamp!  Hiking back out along the trail we noticed someone carrying what<br/>
looked suspiciously like a clue sheet......   We said hello in passing &amp;<br/>
kept on.<br/>
<br/>
Other activities infringed on our letterboxing time, but as soon as the<br/>
basketball game was over, we were back out... With clues in hand, we headed<br/>
to Forest Park in the West Hills above Portland.  With a scant hour before<br/>
dark and the wind rising and threatening rain, all at once, we sprinted up<br/>
the trail.  I told the boys that we would try for all 4 if the light held.<br/>
Box #1 (Skip) came up pretty fast and is beautifully located.  We stamped up<br/>
and rushed on...  box 2 was a little further out and each succeeding box<br/>
that much more.  The wind howling &amp; fingers getting cold by the time we<br/>
located #4 (Spot... a humble fellow in a grand location with great view).<br/>
We finished up and headed back to the truck for hot chocolate.  Finished the<br/>
day with a quick trip to the Audubon Bird Sanctuary to see Syd, the Red<br/>
Tailed Hawk and their newest addition, a Peregrine Falcon with a deformed<br/>
foot.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Amanda!!!  A great series in a great spot!  We notice that you may<br/>
have been there earlier in the day....  did we pass you on the trail at the<br/>
Nature Park?<br/>

It was a full weekend of Letterboxing, all right!  Saturday I was in<br/>
charge of my 7-year-old nephew, Travis, and his dad (my bro) had told<br/>
him about letterboxing so he was pumped and ready to go.  Ken couldn't<br/>
find his name stamp, so I quickly carved out a snake stamp (his current<br/>
favorite critter) and put his name on it, as well.  He liked the stamp<br/>
and we headed out.<br/>
<br/>
He wanted to find the mutts and I wanted to see if my clues were<br/>
child-worthy, so we headed for Forest Park. Thom, you are right.  It was<br/>
a nippy, windy day out there, but that sure didn't hinder the boy I was<br/>
with.  I thought the first box would be the most exciting for him, but<br/>
that was kind of the "learning" box because he wasn't sure what all was<br/>
involved.  <br/>
<br/>
Once Skip was stamped in, his enthusiasm mounted and he was excited<br/>
about finding Rover and the others!  It was so cool to see this being<br/>
introduced to young eyes. We got a great hike out of it and we learned a<br/>
lot from each other.  I discovered his love for school and reading and<br/>
he learned new words he didn't know before like snag, culvert and<br/>
serpentine.  I also learned that 53 adult steps are about 106 kid steps,<br/>
but changing the clues probably aren't warranted since a kid this small<br/>
will probably be with an adult that can pace out the clues for them.<br/>
<br/>
After we got back to the White Stallion (my terribly abused, beat up<br/>
ancient 4-Runner), we gobbled down some lunch that grandma had packed up<br/>
for  us, and, yes!  We headed straight for Tualatin Hills.  TravisI<br/>
wanted more and I wanted him to see other people's fine carved work and<br/>
since we were on that side of town we headed for Thom Territory!  We<br/>
even saw a newt this time.  Not only that, but we saw a friend of ours,<br/>
Michelle, on the trail looking around for the same thing at the farthest<br/>
boardwalk!  She didn't have a stamp or pad, so we whisked her off to<br/>
Peddler's Pack and got her the necessities!  <br/>
<br/>
So...chances are, Thom, you either saw Michelle or Travis and me, or all<br/>
three of us on the trail at some point!  Michelle kind of has longish<br/>
dishwater blonde hair and glasses.  I have short dark hair and glasses,<br/>
I was wearing a dorky hat no doubt, and my companion was the most<br/>
adorable little boy in a baseball cap.  Are you kind of a tall guy with<br/>
a beard?  I did say hi to people on the trail so one of them and their<br/>
kids may have been YOU!  How exciting.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday John and I went up to PCC Sylvania for the sake of finding<br/>
Mitch's collection up there and to further confirm my disdain for<br/>
compass clues.  If it weren't for John, I'd still be up there swearing<br/>
and cursing and wandering off miles from where I was supposed to be.  We<br/>
got the first one, but it got cold and I was not a happy camper because<br/>
of my own personal ineptitude with a compass, so we'll have to bag the<br/>
others later.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, indeed...Letterboxing is alive and well in Portland!<br/>
<br/>

Yup.... that was me.  I was with 2 rambling 8 yr old boys, anxious to stamp<br/>
up and get to the next box.  I saw Travis with trail map and a clue-like<br/>
page at the Nat. Park and wondered...  then when I saw his snake stamp &amp; the<br/>
same date at your pack-o-dog series, I put 2+2 together.<br/>
<br/>
Near miss!<br/>
<br/>
Mitch has planted a stand-in for Rock Creek #1 &amp; I have finally gotten a<br/>
replacement log book to put it back for real.  I believe the entire Rock<br/>
Creek series will be back up and running within the week!<br/>
