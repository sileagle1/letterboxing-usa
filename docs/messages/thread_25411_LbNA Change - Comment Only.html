Two scenarios I run into:</span><span> </span></p><br/><span>1. There are a couple local boxes that aren't mine that I will on occasion take a look at to see if they're OK. Planters are far away or not active. If the box hasn't been found in a long time, it would be nice to just note that the box is OK without recording it as my find. (Unless it's changed, in the past if I logged it as a find, LbNA automatically removes my original find date). </span><br/><br/><p><span>2. I see now that "attempt" = "box is missing." I don't know if someone's box is missing if I never found it before. I probably just read the clues wrong, knowing me. On the other hand, maybe I was at the right location. Who knows? Not me. So I won't log a box as missing. I'm only willing to say I tried and failed. There's a word for that. At any rate, on AQ, I just leave a comment without logging a find or attempt. With LbNA now, all I can do is put the box on ignore so I stop seeing the listing."</span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p></body></html>
