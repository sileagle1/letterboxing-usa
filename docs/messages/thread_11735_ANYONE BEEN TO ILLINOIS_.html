<br/>
                We have a few letterboxers in the area and we wondered who <br/>
has been out this way in the last 12 to 24 months?<br/>
<br/>
                We don't get to all of our boxes very often and wondered if <br/>
anyone had encountered a problem with any of them.  Since spring has sprung <br/>
we are planning to schedule some maintenance.<br/>
<br/>
                    We would also love to hear any fun stories!!!!  We just <br/>
visited two boxes last week and saw five or more letterboxing stamps from out <br/>
of the state (even from the two coasts).  We were so excited!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!!!!<br/>

 PS:  Last spring we had a little trouble with some overzealous geocachers in <br/>
the area picking our letterboxes out as trash and we want to avoid that this <br/>
year and save some of our boxes and avoid the harrassment.<br/>
