PFX 500!  Big happy dance occurred when we returned home and finally <br/>
did the math!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Our adventures during a glorious Pacific Northwest day yesterday <br/>
took us to:<br/>
<br/>
*HH I Love You, SeaTac, WA **since we were at the airport anyway...<br/>
<br/>
*Alder &amp; Cedar LBs, Taylor Mountain, Hobart, WA **great stamps, nice <br/>
hike, good workout!<br/>
<br/>
*Rattlesnake Ledge LB, North Bend, WA **what an incredible view!!! <br/>
Used almost an entire roll of film up there!  The stamp is split in <br/>
two but still functional.  Multiple visitors--some of the same <br/>
letterboxers have returned dozens of times!<br/>
<br/>
We also placed Ouch! Letterbox, Outlaw Tracy Letterbox Series, Catch <br/>
Me! #10 in Renton, WA.<br/>
<br/>
Hope other letterboxers are able to look for these nice letterboxes <br/>
here in the greater Seattle area!<br/>

share of them regarding letterboxing--both good &amp; bad stories)  Long <br/>
story about the acronym, based on a dear friend/college roommate who <br/>
tragically was killed a few years back while serving our country--<br/>
she planned on putting aviatrx license plates on her Hog but <br/>
tragically died right before her bike was delivered.  It's a tribute <br/>
to her as she always seemed so timid, yet lived her life so <br/>
adventurously--truly an example to us all.<br/>
<br/>
rnrB=runner bee--my 4yo DD is a very fast runner and an incredible <br/>
hiker.  Yesterday alone, we logged over 6 miles in 4 different hikes-<br/>
-including 2 major hikes in the region (Rattlesnake Ledge &amp; <br/>
Alder/Cedar-Taylor Mountain--Cascade Mtns, WA) and she made it on <br/>
all of the hikes with plenty of energy to spare after we were <br/>
through.  Incredible what the incentive of a trip to Krispy Kreme <br/>
will do for a 4 year old's motivation!<br/>
<br/>
trkr=trekker--my 17mo DS who is very curious, energetic and enjoys <br/>
hiking, too--although he's a bit slow on the trail because he stops <br/>
every so often to look at neat little displays of nature along the <br/>
way.  However, he really hates hanging out in the backpack--so every <br/>
opportunity he gets to walk (trek) he makes a break for it.<br/>
<br/>
trkee=my dh who is a Star Trek fanatic.  His name started out as a <br/>
joke based on trkr's handle--then it sort of stuck...<br/>
<br/>
So, in a nutshell, those are our handles...<br/>
