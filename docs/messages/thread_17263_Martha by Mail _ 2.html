Its like she knew I was given the task of pulling the boxes with <br/>
christmas decorations from the basement.<br/>
<br/>
Right now she is mulling cider, washing windows with newspaper, and <br/>
making name tags for our table out of corks and pipe cleaners. <br/>
Tonight she has informed me that we will be creating snowflake <br/>
marshmallows and organizing our flatware! How exciting.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow, she shall be headed to the mid-west!<br/>
