                    <div class="plaintext-content">Also remembering now that we had never officially announced on the talklist  that our <br/>
LbNA Lifetime Achievement Letterboxing Award 2007 honoree list has been up and <br/>
running for about a month now ever since Thanksgiving! It's number 127 on our website <br/>
index at   http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html<br/>
<br/>
We hope that this summary of North American letterboxing history as we saw it develop <br/>
will be of interest especially to those newer letterboxers of the past few years who are <br/>
unfamiliar with how letterboxing took on its own style of adventure here on this continent, <br/>
and to whom we owe our special gratitude for this wonderful turn of events! <br/>
<br/>
Certainly there are bound to be those among the newcomers who won't understand at all <br/>
our intentions in honoring these early North American letterboxing pioneers and their <br/>
accomplishments, and will simply need to squawk about why they can't have the stamp, <br/>
too! (or at least that's how it seemed to be in the past, but maybe folks have gained a <br/>
little maturity since then!:-) At any rate, these honorees haven't "won" an arbitrary "Oscar", <br/>
but have by our standards earned  a special place in North American letterboxing history <br/>
for "Lifetime Achievement", so please join with us in applauding their efforts!<br/>
<br/>
And, to those who feel we are simply being "old curmudgeons" who don't like some of the <br/>
directions in which North American letterboxing is currently being pulled (even by some <br/>
former LA-LA recipients - and just take a look at "Joshua's Dilemma" and our "SWOH <br/>
Graveyard" to get a clue about how some of us feel about that!), all we can say is please try <br/>
to honor the ESSENCE of the GAME!  We repeatedly hear from newbies that the game is <br/>
changing, and it's just our tough luck if we "can't keep up with the technology", but we <br/>
believe they are completely missing the point!  It is not the superficial "technological <br/>
trappings" we care about at all, but rather the integrity of the game itself!  All  <br/>
"technological changes" do for games in general is make them more "glitzy", with icons <br/>
and neon lights on the scoreboards, "expert commentators" and astroturf instead of real <br/>
grass, but the rules of engagement for any particular game still remain essentially the <br/>
same - you still need to throw or hit a ball to a certain place to score a point for that <br/>
particular game!  Suppose we suddenly decided, as we have probably all seen little <br/>
children doing in their play games, that you don't have to actually hit the ball to call it a <br/>
"homerun" - just run around the bases for fun, would it still be baseball? Or if people <br/>
decided that they didn't want to bother trying to knock the pins down in a bowling alley by <br/>
rolling a ball from behind a certain line, but just walked down the lane and knocked them <br/>
all down manually,  or decided that rolling gutter balls counted as strikes, would that still <br/>
be bowling??? These are the type of game changes (postals, virtuals, cooties, etc.) we are <br/>
concerned with in letterboxing because they do not preserve the integrity of a game <br/>
whose essence we feel includes a clue, a search and a find!  Yes, as  children, we've all <br/>
bent the rules in games we have played or changed them to suit our whims, but there is <br/>
still general agreement as to what normally constitutes any particular game, and I hope by <br/>
now that most people realize that, for North American-style letterboxing at least, it is <br/>
about the hunt and not just about acquiring stamp images! So, once again, please join us <br/>
in congratulating these special folks who have over the years done so much to help <br/>
establish and play our favorite game so well!<br/>
<br/>
