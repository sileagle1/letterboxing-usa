clues:<br/>
<br/>
San Pedro River Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Azroadie<br/>
Placement date: November  13, 2003<br/>
State:  Arizona<br/>
County:   Cochise<br/>
Nearest city:  Sierra Vista<br/>
Difficulty:  Walk  easy.  Clues  easy<br/>
Walk distance:  about 1.5 miles roundtrip<br/>
<br/>
Box is in San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area (BLM) east of<br/>
Sierra Vista.  From I-10 take State Highway 90 south to Sierra Vista.<br/>
 At Fry Blvd. turn east and continue on Highway 90 about 6.6 miles to<br/>
the entrance to San Pedro House.  Drive south on the dirt road a short<br/>
distance to the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Walk east on the trail that starts between front of San Pedro House<br/>
(visitor center) and restrooms.  At the trail junction where there is<br/>
a bench (1st), go south on the main trail.  At the fifth bench (under<br/>
a Mesquite tree), go exactly East for about 46 paces to a small sign<br/>
with #11 on it.  Facing East go at about 50 degrees for about 54 paces<br/>
to a small scraggly Mesquite tree on top of a steep slope above a<br/>
large Cottonwood tree.  Box is at base of the Mesquite on its south<br/>
side under a large rock and some small branches.   Be alert for snakes<br/>
and scorpions.  Enjoy the view of the pond  you may see a beaver or<br/>
several different species of ducks and geese.<br/>
<br/>
