Somebody that lives near there told me the lake floods<br/>

<br/>
I am from Austin and am wanting to start doing<br/>
letterboxing. I have friends in California that are<br/>
very into it and very excited about it but I am not<br/>
now able to join them in this pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if you would mind my joining you if<br/>
you are letterboxing in Austin or that I might join<br/>
you at some other place in Texas. I can provide you<br/>
with references and will be happy to answer most<br/>
questions about me that you would like to ask.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your consideration Kim!<br/>
