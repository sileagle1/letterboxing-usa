<br/>
Arizona Mystery No. 1 Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Azroadie<br/>
Placement date: November  19, 2003<br/>
State:  Arizona<br/>
<br/>
Go to the land of the Gadsden Purchase.  Go to the county named for a<br/>
tribe and language of the native peoples of that land.  Go to a<br/>
gigantic hole in a mountain with a legend of robbers' loot.  There is<br/>
a fee to enter this high relief playground.  Hungry explorers spread<br/>
their repast at the "little forest".  Walk to the most southerly flat<br/>
concrete slab; then go east a short distance down.  Turn against the<br/>
natural flow.  Continue on the bottom passing a grove of at least<br/>
seven large Saguaros on the steep edge.  At a very large pink boulder<br/>
caressed by a large dead prostrate tree, go up at 90 degrees for about<br/>
26 paces to the first Mesquite tree (three close in a row).  Go at 40<br/>
degrees for about 21 paces to a large Mesquite almost loved to death<br/>
by Mistletoe and with a Prickly Pear cactus growing on its branches. <br/>
The box is at the tree's base on its east side under a rock and some<br/>
twigs.   Be alert for snakes and scorpions.<br/>
<br/>
Contact me if the box needs attention:  <br/>
