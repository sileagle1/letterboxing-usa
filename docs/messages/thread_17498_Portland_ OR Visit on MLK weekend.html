                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay... I'll be in the greater Portland/Beaverton area on MLK weekend <br/>
and hope to do some boxing or maybe even meet up with fellow <br/>
letterboxers, time permitting.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if meeting up will be easy because I will be in Portland <br/>
for a huge dog show that weekend (Fri-Mon)and my schedule will be <br/>
dictated by our ring time each morning/early afternoon and whether or <br/>
not my dog wins Best Of Breed. If she does I'm committed to staying <br/>
at the Portland Metro Convention Center all day/evening. If she <br/>
doesn't win then I am free for the rest of the day. <br/>
<br/>
I will be in my own car (since I'm driving from Tac/Seattle area) and <br/>
able to drive where ever I need to. So if you are local and flexible <br/>
with your times I'd love to meet up and box. Email me and we can plan <br/>
offlist. I should be able to get away from everything on Friday and <br/>
Sunday afternoon easiest.<br/>
<br/>
So...what are some good, local boxes in the Portland/Beaverton area <br/>
where I can do some serious "powerboxing" aka the most boxes in the <br/>
least amount of time or clusters of boxes. I am pretty good with <br/>
directions/maps and have a basic working knowledge of the Metro <br/>
Portland/Beaverton/Hillsboro/Banks area.<br/>
