I just wanted to let folks know that I decided to list the large<br/>
majority of my boxes on the letterboxing USA site again. For a while, <br/>
I had pulled all of my clues and posted them only on our own homepage.<br/>
This was mostly because the clue capability lacked artistic freedom<br/>
and well, both Isosceles and I have now placed enough boxes with all<br/>
different styles and levels, that is is appropriate to have a webpage<br/>
listing that allows us to list clues. <br/>
<br/>
I also would like to minimize traffic to some of the boxes and thus<br/>
they are more difficult, mystery and/or not listed at all. I have gone<br/>
to great care with some of the letterbox placings to ensure that they<br/>
are in keeping with our wilderness of Maine and that they highlight<br/>
the landscape and my interpretation...Others are clues that may be<br/>
obtained from other letterboxers (also called WOM) and/or they are<br/>
urban boxes and require some careful searching. <br/>
<br/>
I highly suggest that when a person searches for boxes, that they<br/>
consider whether or not this box would be appropriate for them/their<br/>
kids/etc. I now divulge myself from responsibility concerning whether<br/>
or not one of my letterboxes is kid friendly or whether or not you can<br/>
push a stroller. I'll be honest, this debate is dead - so if you're<br/>
interested in rating boxes and putting them in categories, then I<br/>
loosely tried to define those clues listed on atlasquest:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying that any of my boxes are offensive, just that there is<br/>
also a certain portion of responsibility that falls on the shoulders<br/>
of those who find boxes. It is up to them to enjoy the experience and<br/>
find the box as well as conceal the hiding location. <br/>
<br/>
The short?<br/>
<br/>
If you see many new boxes in Maine, they're not new - they've all been<br/>
around for a year or so, I've just been lurking on my own site.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to the powers that be for allowing html ref tags in the clue<br/>
listing. Thank you also to Springchick for her informative suggestion<br/>
and examples. <br/>
<br/>
Here's to more great boxes. <br/>
