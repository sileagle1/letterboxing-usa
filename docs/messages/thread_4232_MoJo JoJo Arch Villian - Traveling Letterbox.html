                    <div class="plaintext-content">MoJo JoJo is the arch villian of the Powerpuff Girls! He was sent traveling <br/>
by a mighty &gt;punch&lt; from a flying ButterCup! At the same time 3 travel bugs <br/>
were released from three separate "lettercaches" and a traveling letterbox <br/>
[Professor Utopia At Large] was kidnapped!!!! The three travel bugs, <br/>
ButterCup, Blossom &amp; Bubbles are hoping to rescue Professor Utopia and <br/>
capture MoJo JoJo! <br/>
................................... <br/>
.......................................................... <br/>
MoJo JoJo would like to steer clear of these four. But if you are an upright <br/>
citizen you will do your best to see that MoJo JoJo is brought to justice. <br/>
Please keep him captive and release him only into another properly secured <br/>
letterbox or geocache/letterbox combination. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If , by chance, MoJo JoJo should come into contact with Prof. U. or any of <br/>
the Powerpuff girls .... then I beg you to record their adventures in MoJo <br/>
JoJo's log book. ....................................................... <br/>
Also please stamp MoJo Jojo into any log books you encounter along the way. <br/>
It is possible that his pursuers might visit that very location. Your <br/>
diligence in this matter will surely aid them in their important mission!! <br/>
.......................................................<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, after properly securing MoJo JoJo into another letterbox <br/>
or "lettercache" please send a note stating who found him, when and where to <br/>
letterbox-usa@egroups.com . But do not state where you dropped him off !  <br/>
That could be used by his co-villians in a rescue attempt!<br/>
