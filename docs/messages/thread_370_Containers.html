&gt;  I have dozens of this type of container<br/>
&gt;  that I also store beads in, however they have<br/>
&gt;  tiny compartments (they're originally designed<br/>
&gt;  for fishing fly storage) and don't seal airtight. If I<br/>
&gt;  could find them without compartments, I could<br/>
&gt;  probably attach my own gaskets in the lid. I'd love<br/>
&gt;  to see how that works. Has anyone ever tried<br/>
&gt;  an adhesive on rubbermaid? What works? Is it<br/>
&gt;  vinyl?<br/>
<br/>
I've been wondering also, if a container could be designed<br/>
which opens on the end, but is dimensioned such that a<br/>
postcard could fit inside.  It could be perhaps about<br/>
3 1/2 X 5 1/2 X 1" with a gasket seal on the end cap.<br/>
The cap would be on the 3 1/2" side.  Something light<br/>
weight and durable and non-moisture permeable I think<br/>
would be a good material.  Are cigar humidors ever that<br/>
dimension?<br/>

<br/>
Those seal top plastic bags aren't really waterproof I agree<br/>
<br/>
and there is no perfect container....that I've ever seen..Though old ammo<br/>
boxes were great if a bit bulky !  Strangely the oldest of biscuit tins<br/>
(big old things you could keep 33 rpm LP's in) are watertight if not<br/>
bashed about..I know cos I found a letterbox in one !<br/>
<br/>
I've often wondered if those pneumatic tube containers...those things that<br/>
they used to use in all big stores (before Malls) and in banks and places<br/>
like that ..which whooshed about in long tubes...<br/>
Does anyone remember them..(Dan and I spoke of them ...er a year ago it<br/>
seems...)<br/>
<br/>
There were two types I can recall ..one which opened by rotating the tube<br/>
so two cylinders moved one within the other...and allowed entry when out<br/>
of phase with each other..(I cant help it I have a scientific<br/>
education..pity me !)   But the other type had big fat tops of plastic<br/>
material which had to be unscrewed...<br/>
<br/>
Now I guess these were the nearest thing in size and durability and<br/>
perhaps even water tightness...<br/>
<br/>
But they were in my memory..only....a local hospital junked theirs some<br/>
while ago..and went over to some new fangled computer stuff !<grin> and I<br/>
went just too late to retrieve em all..they'd gone to a landfill !<br/>
<br/>
Now there must be tubes like this...somewhere ?<br/>
<br/>
I use tuppeware..its a bit bulky but it holds a nice size book 4 x 5  ( 4<br/>
" wide) and a good size stamp and post cards and all sorts..even little<br/>
gifts for first finders...and a silica gel bag..oh I am hopeful !<br/>
<br/>
Others on the Moors us Pill Pots ...those that Pharmacists (Druggists) use<br/>
to dispense from...some of these are for 500 - 1000 pills and are about 3<br/>
x 4 and have snap tops...they are free because your druggists just throws<br/>
em out...you just have to ask nicely and wash out traces of  whatever dust<br/>
is left...be careful !!!!<br/>
<br/>
They are a bit small for me and the biggest I can find sold by the<br/>
manufacturer ..are cheap..but are still too small...<br/>
<br/>
So ...I was told by a L-USA member that "in the USA you can get everything<br/>
your heart desires".<br/>
...(I wanted then the poster with the world's largest ketchup bottle on<br/>
it..Yep I got it <grin>)<br/>
<br/>
Now I've tried and tried...to get a nice letterbox pot !<br/>
<br/>
For me my ideal is a  4 and a half inch square cross section, thick but<br/>
flexible plastic jar with a round screw lid say 4 and a quarter inch mouth<br/>
..allows a quarter inch for a tight long thread, the cap must have a nice<br/>
( rubber ? ) seal like those glass jars my ma used to preserve plums (were<br/>
they Kilner Jars ?) They must be be watertight !,   and be about 5 and a<br/>
half inches to six inches  high...be opaque..say brown or green...and be<br/>
tough enough to withstand knocks and the wet and the cold..<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes and cost about 50c each...<br/>
<br/>
Anybody seen anything like that..?<br/>
<br/>
I'll have about 50 please !  <grin><br/>
<br/>
I'll even pay extra for postage <grin><br/>

typically messy Wisconsin winter, but I did notice that one of them<br/>
does not seal properly.  (Or as properly as I think it should, which<br/>
is really what counts!)  The ziplock bags do provide adequate<br/>
protection though, and I haven't noticed any "decay" yet.  Still, I<br/>
also wish there were something a little more reliable like a screw-on<br/>
cap (cylindrical) on a rubbermaid sandwich container (rectangular). <br/>
As you can see, geometrically, we have a bit of a problem.  However...<br/>
and I haven't tried this yet, just brainstorming, what about one of<br/>
those beverage containers?  They have screw-on caps, and are<br/>
rectangular.  Is the circular opening a problem?  I don't know.  Like<br/>
I said, just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
Or better yet, a THERMOS!  It keeps hot stamps hot, and cold stamps<br/>
cold!<br/>

<div>I have been using Skippy low fat plastic containers 
successfully for our city boxes. I clean them out as well as possible , wipe 
them with paint thinner several times,and give them a shot of spray room 
deodorizer. Normally I cover them with colored duct tape to camoflage them. 
Black for dark places, brown for brown backgrounds, silver for concrete 
areas,etc.We don't have bears in Long Beach, but we do have raccoons, possums I 
have never had one of these boxes destroyed by a critter. I am careful where 
they are hidden as many city boxes can't be hidden by just piling on a few 
rocks.Food containers can be used, you just have to use some thought.
