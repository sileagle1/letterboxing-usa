                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am an educator and a 4H leader.  When a local television station <br/>
started featuring geocaching, I called and stated that I'd like to <br/>
tell them about letterboxing because, while similar, the hobby <br/>
doesn't require an expensive GPS. the station wanted to do a feature <br/>
(short, trust me) because the chief meteorologist was especially <br/>
interested in the fact the letterboxing is a 4H project.  (I <br/>
introduced it). He thought all 4H is is cows and chickens--it still <br/>
is, but we do many other very neat things that lead to life-long <br/>
hobbies and interest. <br/>
<br/>
So anyway, he stated he wanted to come to my house and do a story. <br/>
So I gathered my project kids--all three of them--and padded the <br/>
group with parents, grandparents, brothers, and sisters to make <br/>
a 'meeting-looking group' and to make the point that the hobby is <br/>
such a wonderful one because it is very inter-generational and great <br/>
for families to do together; the point of 4H is having adults share <br/>
their hobbies, talents, and interests with children. <br/>
<br/>
The cameraman and meterologist came on a very snowy Sunday and <br/>
watched as the kids carved stamps. I filled them in with the <br/>
materials needed for the hobby and also gave a blah blah about the <br/>
history of the hobby.  In that blah blah, I stressed how important <br/>
it was for letterboxers to be discreet on their quest, etc. The <br/>
meteoroligist wanted to see how to stamp up so I used my signature <br/>
stamp to show him--and that piece showed in the feature.<br/>
<br/>
We traipsed into the snowstorm, selecting the box I had hidden to <br/>
kick off the first 'hide' in the project. One family had found it, <br/>
others hadn't gone out yet. We stood in the parking lot located at <br/>
the beginning of the trail, the celeb read the beginning directions <br/>
with the kids, they showed him to read a compass, and off we went <br/>
down a snowy, woody trail that could have been any snowy, woody <br/>
trail in our state.  The celeb than counted off steps per the <br/>
directions, the kids dug the box out of 12 inches of snow, stamped <br/>
up, end of story, end of what turned out to be a very nice little <br/>
feature in the 9 O'clock weather report.  <br/>
<br/>
This morning I opened up the letterboxing group that people in our <br/>
area use, and to my amazement, I was TROUNCED.  One letterboxer <br/>
wrote,'there goes the neighborhood.'  I was referred to as SHE in a <br/>
long string of negative messages. SHE called the station, SHE is <br/>
telling everyone about this hobby. I know that because I know who <br/>
SHE is.  This is supposed to be secret, we really don't like kids to <br/>
being doing this, especially huge groups that SHE had in the woods, <br/>
SHE should read the directions for letterboxing because obviously <br/>
SHE doesn't know the rules. Parent magazines, the Boy Scouts, etc. <br/>
are promoting this and ruining it and on and on. (I no longer am a <br/>
member of that online group. Quit it this morning).<br/>
<br/>
I believe I do know the 'rules' of letterboxing and since making <br/>
this a hobby and a project, I think I've been downright discreet. I <br/>
invited kids to do this because I've seen pictures of kids in these <br/>
groups' photo albums.  We have found boxes hidden by kids. Kids came <br/>
to gathering we had recently (and loved it.  I was going to invite <br/>
my 4H kids to the gathering and I asked if it would OK. The answer <br/>
was yes.  I didn't take the cameras to anyone else's box but my <br/>
own.  I showed my own stamp. <br/>
<br/>
I did not know that that letterboxing is--at least to some people--<br/>
is a secret society! There is a difference between being discreet <br/>
when one locates a box, but not to tell anyone about the hobby? That <br/>
is absolutely ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be honest with you. I was devestated when I read the kind of <br/>
negativism that I did. I just sat there and cried.  I will never go <br/>
to another gathering in my life. I'll continue the project and my <br/>
family, friends, and will every so stealthily continue our quest for <br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Do you think anyone was really focused on that little story. <br/>
Anna Nicole Smith died on the same day! Who do you think the general <br/>
population is more interested in--4H or celebrity news?<br/>

again.  The tone that I get from them isn't nearly as horrible as <br/>
what you seem to think.  People were initially upset because they <br/>
didn't realize that the planter of the letterbox being sought was <br/>
actually part of the group.  Once that was cleared up, everyone seem <br/>
to feel better about it.  Also, I believe some people were <br/>
using "she" because they didn't know who you were.  The ones who did <br/>
know who you are were trying to protect your privacy so that you <br/>
wouldn't get a whole bunch of email from people who didn't realize <br/>
that it was your box.  Also, a few people were upset because they <br/>
believe that no publicity about letterboxing is good publicity.   <br/>

planting your own box to show a find. I have heard the secret society<br/>
thing but I have pretty much told everyone I know about letterboxing.<br/>
In fact, 2 people happened to meet by chance at a party and started<br/>
chatting and the talk led to letterboxing...turned out they both<br/>
learned of it thru ME and they realized we were all mutual friends.<br/>
And they both live 1800 miles away from me.<br/>
<br/>
Some people in general have no social skills. Some people on the<br/>
internet seem socially-challenged. It's unfortunate, but what can you<br/>
do?<br/>
<br/>
I think your intentions and motives were good and you did a very nice<br/>
job. I am sure if I had seen your news story I would have found it<br/>
very interesting.<br/>
<br/>
All I can tell you is, I have met many letterboxers in person and<br/>
those people were very nice, cool people.<br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">I really don't feel the comments posted at the regional group were <br/>
as bad as you imply; I certainly would not consider them nasty or <br/>
that you were trounced.  Before the piece aired, there was a lot of <br/>
concern at the regional group about the fact that this would be <br/>
visual publicity, which is very different from a print news <br/>
article.  There was concern about how much would be shown, whose <br/>
letterbox might be compromised, etc.?   These are valid concerns <br/>
considering there have been a couple of print articles published in <br/>
this region within recent months in which specific letterboxes were <br/>
named and clues referenced without the knowledge or permission of <br/>
the box planter(s).  Even so, I think the attitude was more that of <br/>
concern and uncertainty rather than attack.<br/>
<br/>
Once the piece aired last night and a member of the group who knows <br/>
you indicated that the box featured was your own box, this concern <br/>
quickly subsided and the primary comments I heard were regarding the <br/>
fact that there was absolutely no mention whatsoever of being <br/>
discreet, rehiding the box well, etc. and the fact that the <br/>
letterboxing group filmed consisted of at least a dozen people.  You <br/>
mentioned in your post that you had stressed the need to be <br/>
discreet, however I have watched the piece several times and there <br/>
is no mention of this at all, not even an inference.  Furthermore <br/>
taking a group of a dozen people out on a letterbox hike certainly <br/>
does not promote the concept of being discreet.  I do understand <br/>
what you are saying about wanting to point out the multi-<br/>
generational aspect, etc., however it would be reasonable for people <br/>
who watched the spot and became involved in letterboxing as a <br/>
result, to emulate your process and think that this is an activity <br/>
that would be suitable for large groups of people, and it really is <br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
The other factor is that most of the people at the regional group <br/>
had no idea who it was doing this piece.  If you are concerned about <br/>
what they are saying and their reaction to your decision to promote <br/>
this in such a visual way, it would have been beneficial if people <br/>
there knew you and were aware of it.  If you want the comaraderie <br/>
and support of a group, it helps to participate in the group -- I <br/>
counted a total of 5 posts from you since November of last year.  I <br/>
realize that the group thing is not for everyone and some people <br/>
prefer to lurk.  There is nothing wrong with that, but in the same <br/>
respect, if that is your choice, then you cannot be surprised when <br/>
the group is less than supportive.<br/>
<br/>
There are many letterboxers who feel all publicity is bad for the <br/>
hobby.  Personally, I don't like the publicity, but do recognize <br/>
that realistically, any good reporter is going to find his story if <br/>
he wants it bad enough, so the best we can do is to ensure that they <br/>
have positive encounters with experienced letterboxers who stress <br/>
the aspects of education, being discreet, rehiding boxes well, etc.  <br/>
However, due to the conflicting opinions on publicity, you have to <br/>
accept that there is going to be some backlash from the community <br/>
when you choose to participate in a publicity piece about <br/>
letterboxing, particularly when the above-mentioned aspects are not <br/>
even mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry if you felt attacked by comments that were made by members <br/>
of the group, but looking at it from the other perspective, many of <br/>
those members felt betrayed by your decision to actively pursue the <br/>
publicity, particularly in visual format.<br/>
<br/>
You are each entitled to your perspective.<br/>

&gt; I am an educator and a 4H leader.  When a local television station <br/>
&gt; started featuring geocaching, I called and stated that I'd like to <br/>
&gt; tell them about letterboxing because, while similar, the hobby <br/>
&gt; doesn't require an expensive GPS. the station wanted to do a <br/>
feature <br/>
&gt; (short, trust me) because the chief meteorologist was especially <br/>
&gt; interested in the fact the letterboxing is a 4H project.  (I <br/>
&gt; introduced it). He thought all 4H is is cows and chickens--it <br/>
still <br/>
&gt; is, but we do many other very neat things that lead to life-long <br/>
&gt; hobbies and interest. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So anyway, he stated he wanted to come to my house and do a story. <br/>
&gt; So I gathered my project kids--all three of them--and padded the <br/>
&gt; group with parents, grandparents, brothers, and sisters to make <br/>
&gt; a 'meeting-looking group' and to make the point that the hobby is <br/>
&gt; such a wonderful one because it is very inter-generational and <br/>
great <br/>
&gt; for families to do together; the point of 4H is having adults <br/>
share <br/>
&gt; their hobbies, talents, and interests with children. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The cameraman and meterologist came on a very snowy Sunday and <br/>
&gt; watched as the kids carved stamps. I filled them in with the <br/>
&gt; materials needed for the hobby and also gave a blah blah about the <br/>
&gt; history of the hobby.  In that blah blah, I stressed how important <br/>
&gt; it was for letterboxers to be discreet on their quest, etc. The <br/>
&gt; meteoroligist wanted to see how to stamp up so I used my signature <br/>
&gt; stamp to show him--and that piece showed in the feature.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We traipsed into the snowstorm, selecting the box I had hidden to <br/>
&gt; kick off the first 'hide' in the project. One family had found it, <br/>
&gt; others hadn't gone out yet. We stood in the parking lot located at <br/>
&gt; the beginning of the trail, the celeb read the beginning <br/>
directions <br/>
&gt; with the kids, they showed him to read a compass, and off we went <br/>
&gt; down a snowy, woody trail that could have been any snowy, woody <br/>
&gt; trail in our state.  The celeb than counted off steps per the <br/>
&gt; directions, the kids dug the box out of 12 inches of snow, stamped <br/>
&gt; up, end of story, end of what turned out to be a very nice little <br/>
&gt; feature in the 9 O'clock weather report.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This morning I opened up the letterboxing group that people in our <br/>
&gt; area use, and to my amazement, I was TROUNCED.  One letterboxer <br/>
&gt; wrote,'there goes the neighborhood.'  I was referred to as SHE in <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; long string of negative messages. SHE called the station, SHE is <br/>
&gt; telling everyone about this hobby. I know that because I know who <br/>
&gt; SHE is.  This is supposed to be secret, we really don't like kids <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; being doing this, especially huge groups that SHE had in the <br/>
woods, <br/>
&gt; SHE should read the directions for letterboxing because obviously <br/>
&gt; SHE doesn't know the rules. Parent magazines, the Boy Scouts, etc. <br/>
&gt; are promoting this and ruining it and on and on. (I no longer am a <br/>
&gt; member of that online group. Quit it this morning).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I believe I do know the 'rules' of letterboxing and since making <br/>
&gt; this a hobby and a project, I think I've been downright discreet. <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; invited kids to do this because I've seen pictures of kids in <br/>
these <br/>
&gt; groups' photo albums.  We have found boxes hidden by kids. Kids <br/>
came <br/>
&gt; to gathering we had recently (and loved it.  I was going to invite <br/>
&gt; my 4H kids to the gathering and I asked if it would OK. The answer <br/>
&gt; was yes.  I didn't take the cameras to anyone else's box but my <br/>
&gt; own.  I showed my own stamp. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I did not know that that letterboxing is--at least to some people--<br/>
&gt; is a secret society! There is a difference between being discreet <br/>
&gt; when one locates a box, but not to tell anyone about the hobby? <br/>
That <br/>
&gt; is absolutely ridiculous.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll be honest with you. I was devestated when I read the kind of <br/>
&gt; negativism that I did. I just sat there and cried.  I will never <br/>
go <br/>
&gt; to another gathering in my life. I'll continue the project and my <br/>
&gt; family, friends, and will every so stealthily continue our quest <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; P.S. Do you think anyone was really focused on that little story. <br/>
&gt; Anna Nicole Smith died on the same day! Who do you think the <br/>
general <br/>
&gt; population is more interested in--4H or celebrity news?<br/>

<br/>
I would like to add, as one who has NOT read the regional board, but who has<br/>
had to try to quell such topics as they go out of control, that if you<br/>
haven't actually read the board in question, it is probably best not to jump<br/>
on the bandwagon.  In the first place, I think/hope that the OP's purpose in<br/>
writing was to vent, not to be divisive.  Secondly, without an objective<br/>
view of all the facts, how can any of us who haven't read the board decide<br/>
who were acting like jerks or being ugly?<br/>
<br/>
I certainly understand that Robert feels wronged and I'm very sorry he feels<br/>
that way.  However, we can easily say "sorry you feel badly about the<br/>
comments" without jumping in and commenting on the character of the ones who<br/>
spoke out.<br/>
<br/>
The way these things often play out is 1) someone vents.  2) bunches of<br/>
folks jump in and say "those people who offended you must be horrid," 3) the<br/>
people who spoke out get upset that they are being called horrid when all<br/>
they felt they were doing is voicing their opinions.  4) lines are drawn and<br/>
sides are taken and silly things are said.  5)  the originator calms down<br/>
and feels better and realizes they might have overreacted just a little.  6)<br/>
the "horrid" people realize they possibly could've been a little less<br/>
"spirited" in their comments.  7) and while they are sorting out their<br/>
differences, war rages all around by people who weren't involved in the<br/>
first place.<br/>
<br/>
Let's cut out all the middle stuff and be supportive of both sides.  I'm<br/>
sure we all know and like quite a few of the people on the board in<br/>
question.  And without knowing anything about Robert, I think I would like<br/>
him too given that he likes to do kid-work just like I do.<br/>

sympathy.  As a letterboxer from the UK I find the 'secretive' <br/>
attitude that many hold towards letterboxing to be, quite frankly, an <br/>

<br/>
The idea behind letterboxing is for a box to be placed in order for <br/>
others to find, end of story - the idea is not for the box to be <br/>
hidden for a select few to find - clues to Dartmoor boxes (which, may <br/>
i remind you is the home of letterboxing) are publicised in a <br/>

Know I now your going to argue that non-letterboxers may find the box <br/>
and vandalise/steal it! Get over it, the amount of boxes that go <br/>
missing from Dartmoor each year would scare you silly - thats the <br/>
price we pay for placing them in public places that are accessable <br/>
by.........the public!<br/>
<br/>
As for introducing younger generations to the pastime?  Personally I <br/>
think you deserve a pat on the back!  Raising an awareness of <br/>
letterboxing is vitally important.  But more crucial is the fact that <br/>
you are introducing these youngsters to the great outdoors and all of <br/>
the adventures that can go with it.  Along with this we can teach the <br/>
younger  ones a respect for the outdoors, the environment and <br/>
wildlife.  This education is paramount, now more than ever, if we are <br/>
to curtail the damage that we have already inflicted.<br/>
If letterboxing can be used as a medium for getting these children <br/>
out into the wilds then I say do it.<br/>
<br/>
I realise that some of you will not like, or agree, with my comments <br/>
and no offence is intended, but I would ask you this one <br/>
question:  "What is more important - An individuals feelings or a <br/>
little rubber stamp in plastic tub?"<br/>

I disagree. Look at the subject title. "Help me out with this!"  <br/>
If she was just looking to vent I don't think she would have worded it <br/>
that way. Maybe "Listen to this!" or something similar.<br/>
I think she was feeling like everyone was against her on the other <br/>

I also have read the posts on the other board (as this was unfolding; <br/>

As for introducing younger generations to the pastime? Personally I <br/>
think you deserve a pat on the back! Raising an awareness of <br/>
letterboxing is vitally important. But more crucial is the fact that <br/>
you are introducing these youngsters to the great outdoors and all of <br/>
the adventures that can go with it. Along with this we can teach the <br/>
younger ones a respect for the outdoors, the environment and <br/>
wildlife. This education is paramount, now more than ever, if we are <br/>
to curtail the damage that we have already inflicted.<br/>
If letterboxing can be used as a medium for getting these children <br/>
out into the wilds then I say do it.<br/>
<br/>
I realise that some of you will not like, or agree, with my comments <br/>
and no offence is intended, but I would ask you this one <br/>
question: "What is more important - An individuals feelings or a <br/>
little rubber stamp in plastic tub?"<br/>

&gt; This morning I opened up the letterboxing group that people in our <br/>
&gt; area use, and to my amazement, I was TROUNCED. One letterboxer <br/>
&gt; wrote,'there goes the neighborhood.' I was referred to as SHE in a <br/>
&gt; long string of negative messages. SHE called the station, SHE is <br/>
&gt; telling everyone about this hobby. I know that because I know who <br/>
&gt; SHE is. This is supposed to be secret, we really don't like kids <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; being doing this, especially huge groups that SHE had in the woods, <br/>
&gt; SHE should read the directions for letterboxing because obviously <br/>
&gt; SHE doesn't know the rules. Parent magazines, the Boy Scouts, etc. <br/>
&gt; are promoting this and ruining it and on and on. (I no longer am a <br/>
&gt; member of that online group. Quit it this morning).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I believe I do know the 'rules' of letterboxing and since making <br/>
&gt; this a hobby and a project, I think I've been downright discreet. I <br/>
&gt; invited kids to do this because I've seen pictures of kids in these <br/>
&gt; groups' photo albums. We have found boxes hidden by kids. Kids <br/>
came <br/>
&gt; to gathering we had recently (and loved it. I was going to invite <br/>
&gt; my 4H kids to the gathering and I asked if it would OK. The answer <br/>
&gt; was yes. I didn't take the cameras to anyone else's box but my <br/>
&gt; own. I showed my own stamp. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I did not know that that letterboxing is--at least to some people--<br/>
&gt; is a secret society! There is a difference between being discreet <br/>
&gt; when one locates a box, but not to tell anyone about the hobby? <br/>
That <br/>
&gt; is absolutely ridiculous.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll be honest with you. I was devestated when I read the kind of <br/>
&gt; negativism that I did. I just sat there and cried. I will never go <br/>
&gt; to another gathering in my life. I'll continue the project and my <br/>
&gt; family, friends, and will every so stealthily continue our quest <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; P.S. Do you think anyone was really focused on that little story. <br/>
&gt; Anna Nicole Smith died on the same day! Who do you think the <br/>
general <br/>
&gt; population is more interested in--4H or celebrity news?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">while i do not agree with everyone taking their clues off line i do believe<br/>
in the somewhat secretive nature of letterboxing. i can see your point uk,<br/>
that the clues are available in a catalogue available to anyone that wishes<br/>
to buy it. the vast majority of clues here are on line for anyone who wishes<br/>
to look.  i don't think the issue here is the availability of clues, or even<br/>
the secrecy of clues, but rather the respect of the letterbox and the nature<br/>
of the game. not sure what you mean by the "secretive" attitude of<br/>
letterboxing. do you mean secretive as in "i am a letterboxer", secretive in<br/>
guarding the clues, or secretive in the actual search for the treasure?<br/>
<br/>
i do not hide the fact that i am a letterboxer, tho i am cautious of how<br/>
much information i hand out. after all once you know letterboxing is out<br/>
there the rest is up to you. do the research, find the box, learn the game.<br/>
judging  by the many personal web sites i would say that being a letterboxer<br/>
is not all that secretive. secretive in guarding clues, i suppose a person<br/>
is free to do what they want to do. there is a factor of just plain fun when<br/>
you receive that wom, or a box that is not published in the ordinary way.<br/>
secretive in the actual search, i should hope so. is this part different in<br/>
the uk? or do you show others where you found the letterbox at? <br/>
<br/>
it all comes down to respect, in the uk or in the us. respect of the game,<br/>
respect for eachother. <br/>

<br/>
**************I think you hit the nail on the head.  We had a reporter who<br/>
wrote an article about letterboxing in my county a couple of years ago.  She<br/>
contacted all of the planters in the county (three of us at that time) and<br/>
we wound up talking among ourselves.  We agreed the article could be done<br/>
responsibly, and we agreed to certain things we should stipulate.  It was<br/>
indeed done very well.  The key was that each of us who had boxes that would<br/>
be placed at risk by the article agreed to accept the risk.<br/>
<br/>
By the same token, when I take scouts letterboxing, I let them cut their<br/>
teeth on my boxes because I don't want to jeopardize anyone else's.  I don't<br/>
try to hide from them how they can find more information, but I don't spoon<br/>
feed them the information they need either.  The boys I've taken along with<br/>
me are now skilled enough they could do it on their own, but I still don't<br/>
plan on handing them clues, but giving them the resources they need to find<br/>
clues for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The wrong publicity can be and is, at times, damaging, whether it is<br/>
broadcast or print or word of mouth.  I think we all have to bear in mind<br/>
that publicity in general has a ripple effect and that it is respectful to<br/>
at least give notice to other boxers who may be affected.<br/>

those in that area who really could do without your 15 minutes of <br/>
fame.  They are equally entitled to their opinions, but THEY kept <br/>
them on the regional board instead of coming here to stir up a <br/>

calling or anything of that nature.  They simply expressed their <br/>
opinions and sometimes with understandable exasperation.<br/>

If you had been a regular reader on this board you'd have known the <br/>
general consensus about publicity.  It has been hashed and rehashed <br/>
ad nauseum,  Instead, you want to what--gain people to go to the <br/>
regional board to defend your decision?  That's just wrong!<br/>
<br/>
I'm with inkidinkystamper on this one--keep things that happen on <br/>
other boards, on those boards.  Defend yourself and your actions.  If <br/>
you unable to do that, perhaps you need to examine your motivations.<br/>

&gt; the comments, that is exactly what some of the people on this board <br/>
did.<br/>
&gt; I also have read the posts on the other board (as this was <br/>
unfolding; <br/>
&gt; not after the fact) and I watched the news clip. Before anyone <br/>
jumps on <br/>
&gt; any bandwagons, I suggest they do the same.<br/>

thing I can conclude is that the person was hopin' to start a few fires.<br/>
<br/>
And I love how anytime someone who wants their clues spoon-fed to 'em gets<br/>
upset with folks who don't list their boxes on LbNA or atlasquest, suddenly<br/>
there's always this Secret Letterboxing Cabal.  A few folks need to get off<br/>
their big fat butts and do a little more research to find the clues.  Oops!<br/>
That's not instant gratification if we do *that*.<br/>
<br/>
Open wide.........here comes the Marshall Field's truck!  Let's keep that<br/>
spoon-feeding comin' now.   Oops!  Oh dear.  No more Marshall Field's.<br/>
*Now* whatever are the parents going to use to get the kiddies to eat their<br/>
peas?  I know!  Atlasquest!  LbNA!<br/>
<br/>
Open wide..........here come the atlasquest clues!   See?  That works.  Peas<br/>
all gone.<br/>
That terrible terrible cabal trying to deprive starving children in America<br/>
of clues.<br/>

I'm with inkidinkystamper on this one--keep things that happen on<br/>
other boards, on those boards.  Defend yourself and your actions.  If<br/>
you unable to do that, perhaps you need to examine your motivations.<br/>

have many boxes that are "pin-up girls" and although I wouldn't<br/>

might be a little much for a small child. So they are listed as WOM. I<br/>
also have a couple of boxes where the place is SO COOL but very<br/>
sensitive in nature, that it's best to have lower traffic to the box.<br/>
So I make it WOM. In my experience, many people don't take the time to<br/>
ask for WOM clues so I only end up giving them out once in<br/>
awhile..just perfect for those locations.<br/>

<br/>
Just a heads up for anyone who is looking at my logbook of WOM clues.<br/>

&gt; !!!!!Shocking!!!!!  You mean the clues/boxes are not guarded like <br/>
&gt; precious jewels to be shown only to your closest friends?!?!?  And <br/>
&gt; just ANYONE can go and hunt without knowing the secret handshake or <br/>
&gt; living next door to the placer?  How common.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ;-D  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some folks here in the US have suggested that everyone should take <br/>
&gt; their clues off-line completely to prevent box loss.  I guess that <br/>
&gt; means you need to personally know the placer to obtain clue...IMHO, <br/>
&gt; WOM is fun sometimes, but one of the things that attracts me most to <br/>
&gt; this hobby is that I can create something - hopefully a little work <br/>
&gt; of art - and put it out there in the world and folks I don't know and <br/>
&gt; will probably never meet will find and enjoy it.  Also, living where <br/>
&gt; the sport is not widely played, I have to travel to play, and don't <br/>
&gt; always have a personal connection to hit up for clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OK, back to lurking - I await the slings and arrows of outraged <br/>
&gt; boxers.<br/>

I (and especially my BF) would be very interested in collecting your <br/>
pin-up girls someday.  Did you use Vargas as your inspiration?  I'll <br/>
bet they're lovely!  Perhaps (since I'm unlikely to ever come to your <br/>
location) you could email me a photo off-list?  Thanks!<br/>
