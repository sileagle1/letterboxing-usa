Favorite toys from the childhood of many of my contemporaries were the acti=<br/>
on figures <br/>
and animals from the Marx Johnny West and Best of the West series.<br/>
<br/>
These 12" figures included our hero, Johnny, Jane his wife...daughter Josie=<br/>
 (and later <br/>
Janice)...his boy Elroy (no wait, that was somebody else)...his boys Jay an=<br/>
d Jamie...bad man <br/>
Sam Cobra, and noble Native Americans Geronimo, Chief Cherokee, and later F=<br/>
ighting <br/>
Eagle and Princess Wildflower. Later came Custer and the Calvary, a couple =<br/>
of Sheriffs, and <br/>
a variety of UK, Canadian and Mexican versions. These figures exhibited ful=<br/>
l articulation <br/>
and molded on clothes, and came with a host of vinyl and poly-plastic acces=<br/>
sories. The <br/>
series ran from 1965 to 1975. Somehow my parents neglected to buy these for=<br/>
 me at the <br/>
time, but like a good boomer, I am happily acquiring them now.<br/>
<br/>
This series of stamps (five so far) celebrates these figures and takes them=<br/>
 down off the <br/>
collector's shelf and puts them back into the Western landscape they love. =<br/>
Yee-haw!<br/>
<br/>
As our story continues, Chief Cherokee has tracked Sam Cobra to his hideout=<br/>
 and is on a <br/>
vision quest to summon the forces of good to come to the aid of his good fr=<br/>
iends, Johnny <br/>
and especially Jane West, who as you recall, is trapped miles away in the b=<br/>
arren wilds of <br/>
Valle del Fuego.<br/>
<br/>
After finding Best of the West Series #5: Sam Cobra, return to trail by the=<br/>
 tree with the <br/>
organic steps that led to his hideout. Go 60 paces down the dirt trail at a=<br/>
 bearing of 45 <br/>
degrees. Leave the main trail and follow a rocky path that hugs the cliff 4=<br/>
4 paces.<br/>
<br/>
Chief Cherokee is under a small rock ledge on your left behind three rocks.=<br/>
 You will know <br/>
you are in the right spot by taking in the vast view down the mountain at t=<br/>
he road <br/>
"snaking" up the hill towards "a full moon that never fades." Beware of pow=<br/>
erful totems <br/>
and leave them be!<br/>
<br/>
BONUS: Marx Toys Logo Intra-Series Hitchhiker<br/>
Keep your eye out for a lil' extra stamp of the Marx Toys logo to complete =<br/>
the Best of the <br/>
West series. When you find it, stamp the logo on your Best of the West imag=<br/>
e, as shown on <br/>
the cover of the log book, and count that box as one "f" and one "hh." You =<br/>
may take the <br/>
stamp with you and leave it in the last series box you visit, otherwise lea=<br/>
ve it for the next <br/>
finder, thanks!<br/>
