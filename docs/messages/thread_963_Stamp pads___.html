                    <div class="plaintext-content">Jay, my favorite ink pads by far are ColorBox.  The range of colors is phenomenal <br/>
and the quality is excellent.  They cost more than your standard office-quality <br/>
stamp pad (about $6.00) but last forever.  The colors are well saturated and they <br/>
leave a nice, solid impression.<br/>
<br/>
You can read about them here:<br/>

<br/>
For carving stamps, try out a few different rubber erasers available at your <br/>
local art supply or office supply store.  If they are thick you won't have to <br/>
mount them on wood.  I like the white Mars erasers but they are a little too soft <br/>
for my taste. Last year I found a tougher blue one (I forget the brand now) that <br/>
I found easier to carve because it resisted a little more.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
