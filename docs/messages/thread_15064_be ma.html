I love your posts!  I am new at this and excited to read of others boxing<br/>
with their kids.  I currently have a 6yo, 4.5yo and 15 mnth old, so am<br/>
sticking to easy trails right now.  It is great fun to read your family<br/>
adventures and think that someday...<br/>
<br/>
How old are your children?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Pam!  Glad to hear from you!  Be is 8 and Ma is 6 and we have a lot of <br/>
fun letterboxing.  There are many other families with young kids and it's <br/>
fun to share tales!<br/>
<br/>
Please don't let the bickering that has been going on lately discourage you <br/>
from posting your adventures, questions, whatever!  Every once in a while a <br/>
conflict stirs up -- sort of like the daily special!  We just treat it as <br/>
part of the daily update call to hubby regarding what is new in the world <br/>
"what's the list uproar about today?!..."<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for emailing!  It's wonderful to hear that you enjoy the stories <br/>
-- sometimes I get to wondering if my bantering is driving everyone up a <br/>
wall!  But -  we've got to be ourselves and live and let live.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, that is how most of these little "controversies" end -- everyone <br/>
agrees to disagree and respect the fact that we are all different in little <br/>
ways (life is much more interesting that way!)<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!  BeMa<br/>

letterboxing with small children.  DS (Lawrence of Asquiddia) is 6 &amp; <br/>
I also have a 19mo that does very well in a backpack carrier.  I've <br/>
printed out some of BeMa's clues since they seem appropriate for our <br/>
family.  There are so many boxes in this area, but it's sometimes <br/>
hard to tell from the description which ones will work with <br/>
little'uns.  Happy stamping!<br/>
