<br/>
Also, are you mounting the stamp?  If yes, is there any way you can position<br/>
the two pieces close enough together when mounting so that it comes out<br/>
stamping like one stamp? I did that once also.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to go overboard sometimes in my carving when I should just. leave.<br/>
well. enough. alone.!!  Sometimes it just pays to go to bed.  Or if it's<br/>
mid-morning, then sometimes it just pays to go *back* to bed.<br/>
