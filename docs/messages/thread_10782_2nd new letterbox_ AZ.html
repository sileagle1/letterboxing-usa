                    <div class="plaintext-content">On February 10, 2003 Funhog placed the Saguaro Sunset Letterbox near Tucson, Pima County, Arizona. This <br/>
box is hidden near a small watering hole. It's a great place to watch desert wildlife, especially at dusk and <br/>
dawn.  You may even be lucky enough to see one of my desert cousins, the javelina, having a drink here. It <br/>
should only take you a few minutes to find the hiding place along a short, level path. <br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: From Tucson go west on Speedway, over Gates Pass and right on Kinney Road. Continue past <br/>
the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. About .25 mile past the entrance to the Red Hills Visitor Center, you will <br/>
see a parking area on the left. The trail begins here just to the left of the recycling bin.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: When water equals life, fork to the right. A tree festooned with mistletoe shades cement. <br/>
Step behind the tree. At 280 degrees you will see a saguaro enmeshed in the embrace of a departed friend. <br/>
The letterbox lives at the feet of the friend, protected by bark, rocks and twigs.<br/>
