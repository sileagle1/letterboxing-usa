to miss it. The common cold came visiting and turned nasty on the <br/>
Cowboy. His 102 temp kept him to the couch for the weekend.( Dr.s <br/>
visit today should have him on the mend) Our thoughts were with you <br/>
and we hope to cross trail with some of you throught the fall. It <br/>
really is my favorite time to be out in the woods hiking and enjoying <br/>
New England. See you then and Bon Voyage to the psychokiwis our good <br/>
friends who will watch the sun when we can't now.   Leader of the Pack<br/>
