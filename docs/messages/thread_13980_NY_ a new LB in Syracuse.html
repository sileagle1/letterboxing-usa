Difficulty rating: Moderate, not suitable for families with small<br/>
children.  There are some difficult rocky areas.  <br/>
It took us about 1 1/2 - 2 hours, we were not rushing, and were<br/>
familiar with the area.<br/>
The park has a carry in -  carry out policy with garbage bags<br/>
available at the ticket booth.  We picked up litter along the way when<br/>
planting this box and carried it out.  Always a good idea on an outing.<br/>
