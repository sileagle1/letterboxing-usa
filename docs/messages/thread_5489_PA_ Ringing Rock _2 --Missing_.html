box I found (Feb 2002); however, at the time I didn't have a stamp or log<br/>
book.  Since I was back in the area (found the 3 Haycock boxes), I decided<br/>
to stop by and stamp the Ringing Rock boxes.  Ringing Rock #1 was still in<br/>
the same place it was in Feburary, however, we were unable to locate box #2.<br/>
Since we had found the box before, we were sure we were looking in the<br/>
correct place; however it wasn't there.  Acorrding to box #1, the last group<br/>
of letterboxers came through on 30-Mar-2002.  Has anyone seen box #2 during<br/>
the past two month?<br/>
<br/>
Just a note on Haycock box #2.  It is now sharing its home with a Turkey<br/>
Vulture.  Before you go in after it, you might want to make sure the Turkey<br/>
Vulture isn't home.<br/>

<div>SpaceTraveler,</div>

<div>My hiking partner Timshel found Haycock #2 while I 
was looking for #1 so I missed the bird.  However, according to her, it was 
making a lot of noise and before she could look in the box's hiding place, the 
vulture flew out.  We found lots of feathers, but we didn't notice a 
nest.  We quickly stamped our books, and left before it 
returned.</div>
