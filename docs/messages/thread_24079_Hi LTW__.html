gona do it in NH but I never got around to it until now. I now have to brave<br/>
the spider and alligators and snakes..OH MY! *smile* <br/>
<br/>
How many have you guys found and have you planted any?? I just found my<br/>
first one today. There are a few in this area but they don't seem to change<br/>
much so once I have found them I will have to travel to find more. I can't<br/>
wait to learm enough to plant my own boxes and get some fun started! There<br/>
are some neat ones in LongBoat Key but I will have to find a whole day to<br/>
spend out there to do taht. It is about 45 minutes north of me..<br/>
<br/>
Hey again to you karolyn!! Love you guys and miss you all so much!!<br/>
