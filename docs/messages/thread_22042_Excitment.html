                    <div class="plaintext-content">I surely do!  It was in a park my family went to visit<br/>
often, down a trail I had been down many, many times. <br/>
In fact, when I read the clues, I could almost tell<br/>
you exactly where it was!<br/>
<br/>
It was very difficult for me to believe that there was<br/>
something hidden along that very trail that I thought<br/>
I knew so well, so when we went digging, I fully<br/>
expected to come up empty-handed.  Lo and behold,<br/>
exactly where the clues said it would be was the box -<br/>
with everything in it that I thought was going to be<br/>
there!<br/>
<br/>
I visited that box again recently with some friends<br/>
who I had just introduced to boxing.   We had been on<br/>
a long, arduous hike - one of those hikes that seems<br/>
like it is uphill the whole way - and the letterboxing<br/>
came at the very end of the hike.  I knew that if we<br/>
had gone in the other direction, we could have been to<br/>
the box in five minutes or so, but we were out<br/>
participating in Scouting's Jamboree On The Trail, so<br/>
it seemed fitting that we take the long way.  Both of<br/>
my friends had about had it with hiking and they both<br/>
sat down on a log to rest.  I started homing in on the<br/>
box - buried behind the log right under their rear<br/>
ends!  I had to laugh at them as they jumped up,<br/>
startled to find they had been sitting on my mission! <br/>
I remembered how unsuspecting I had been when I found<br/>
that box too...<br/>
<br/>
As a bonus, I flipped through the logbook and found<br/>
that my family had been FF's on that box - and we had<br/>
used store-bought stamps.  Our first day letterboxing<br/>
had been the only time we had used store-bought and I<br/>
had completely forgotten that we had ever used them. <br/>
Wow!   <br/>

You bet I remember my first! It was a mystery box by Cherokee Rose and I <br/>
was sooo excited when I found it that I accidentally stamped the log <br/>
book with its own stamp instead of my own! I was about 30 shades of red <br/>
and I DID explain it to the owner and I DID stamp in with my own stamp <br/>
as well. That was 3 months and many many boxes ago. I have been a true <br/>
addict ever since and love every second of it (welllll-maybe not hiking <br/>
on the side of a cliff to get a box and maaaaybe not walking on wet <br/>
slippery rocks) but I love the rest of it!<br/>

California. It's an 'indoor' box and was hidden, unbeknownenced to anyone <br/>
inside, in a VERy off-limits place. You really had to be sneaky. In fact, since it <br/>
was my first box, I was chicken to go for it and had to come back the next day <br/>
with a  look out to cover my back! I even had her take a photo of me getting <br/>
it and it's in my log book.<br/>
<br/>
A few months after I found it, another unlucky finder was discovered, assumed <br/>
to be a terrorist and the place was locked down and the cops called! It now <br/>
resides "behind the desk" of said establishment but--what fun is that!? (no <br/>
wonder it has been adopted--the owner never wanted to be identified!) <br/>
<br/>
I'm so glad I was able to find it in the original, exciting, spot! <br/>

To this day, it is still thrilling to think about. As I sat <br/>
stamping in, my palms were sweating, worrying about <br/>
putting the thing back in its stealthy hiding place. I <br/>
figured out what direction I should be facing when I did <br/>
it and how to do it as quickly as possible. The stamp was <br/>
no stunning work of art but it is hand carved, the clues <br/>
very clever, the hiding place was brilliant. I do hope the <br/>
creator of this box knows what a memorable box they <br/>
hid!  Funhog<br/>
