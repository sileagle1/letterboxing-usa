                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sadly the information that is forthcoming about the proposed Cape Cod<br/>
gathering is a little discouraging.  The Yachtsman has been feverishly<br/>
trying to find us all a spot to meet on that date, but apparently to<br/>
no avail.  After believing that he had a commitment for a "pavilion"<br/>
in Nickerson State Park (Brewster), he found out that there was a<br/>
glitch in the plans.  He then tried a place near the Cape Cod canal as<br/>
an alternative site, but that one required all attendees to "camp",<br/>
which was not going to happen.  The short synopsis is that no<br/>
protected site was available for that weekend.  Therefore, we are<br/>
going to have to postpone this happening to a later date.  We are<br/>
suggesting Sunday, June 2nd at this time and investigating<br/>
possibilities.  It looks like we shall have to give up on the idea of<br/>
a pavilion being available anywhere on the Cape, as they are all quite<br/>
expensive to rent, and we don't want to incur the expenses up front<br/>
and then have nobody come.  So the thought is to have the gathering in<br/>
a picnic area, and to bring a large tarp with poles to erect over the<br/>
site.  Obviously we are going to have to explore several places that<br/>
might accomodate such a gathering in more detail.  Hence there will be<br/>
a delay in this gathering.  Incidentally, several other letterboxers<br/>
are already hard at work designing some new boxes at different sites.<br/>
 So when it actually happens there will be some new spots to check out.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is planning to go to the Cape on May 3, however, there are<br/>
already many boxes out there waiting to be found!  <br/>
