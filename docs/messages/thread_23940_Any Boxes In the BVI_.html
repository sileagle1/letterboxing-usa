We're heading down to the British Virgin Islands (Virgin Gorda in<br/>
particular) next week and were wondering if anyone knew of any boxes<br/>
that weren't posted on the main sites. LBNA has one listed on Tortola<br/>
but I'm not sure if we'll get a chance to go for that one. We will be<br/>
taking one with us to plant so all you Caribbean Cruisers will have a<br/>
