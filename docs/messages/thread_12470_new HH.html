Both were safe and dry. I left my new 'Hitchhiking Toad' in one of them. Two things to note... BUG SPRAY!!!!!!!!!! I was SWARMED by mosquitos at the Skidaway box so go prepared, and both boxes list dead oaks as clues, both oak trees are alive and leafy. Thanks to both boxers! The Railway Trail was a hybrid geocache, my first one, and a pretty walk. Debean<br/>
