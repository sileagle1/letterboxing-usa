<br/>
A few centuries ago, JugglerMouse and I sent forth the Cheese Racing <br/>
set. Of course the better cause (though not the better carved) was <br/>
the NO CHEESE RACING. <br/>
<br/>
We just wondered were the set was and perhaps we should have it back <br/>
for inspection and service.<br/>
<br/>
Please send any sightings to me here.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Sir Balthazar<br/>
