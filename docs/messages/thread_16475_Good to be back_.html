<br/>
Well, the after an incredibly busy and taxing summer with (boo hoo) no letterboxing at all, the Alphabet Bandits are getting back in gear.  We've planted the first box in our Alphabet Series.  <br/>
<br/>
Talking Turtle's 'puter's been actin up, so alas we haven't had a chance to post the clue.  For anyone interested being the first to be our first visitor, you can e-mail me for the clue.  Our "B" box is located in the Hudson Valley of New York on Mt. Beacon.  Beautiful view, and nice hike,  moderate in it's energy requirement, but easy in difficulty.  Very kid friendly.<br/>
<br/>
If there are any Halloween gatherings in the NorthEast, Please let us know, we missed the Gerbil and PotteryWorks and Riverbend gatherings and we're itchin' to meet up.  Fright Fest sounds great, but that takes road trip to an all new level!<br/>
<br/>
BTW... Where's Ryan?<br/>
<br/>
Have a Boxious Day!<br/>
<br/>
Talking Turtle<br/>
