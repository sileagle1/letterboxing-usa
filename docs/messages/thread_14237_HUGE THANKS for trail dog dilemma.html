                    <div class="plaintext-content">I want to thank EVERYONE for their excellent advice regarding my <br/>
trail dog dilemma.  I'm going to nix the dog biscuit option and get a <br/>
sturdy walking stick.  I am particularly appreciative of the knee to <br/>
chest manuever (disable, but not harm).  Having studied the martial <br/>
arts for 20+ years, I am adept with a bowstaff and can use it <br/>
effectively to disable but not harm.  I may be little (5'2" and 100 <br/>
lbs wringing wet), but I'm fast and mighty.  I feel much better now <br/>
knowing specifically WHAT to do, having never owned a dog.  As far as <br/>
reporting to the trailmaster, I usually carry a disposable camera.  <br/>
As I dislike confrontation with another human (whose personality I do <br/>
not know and cannot quickly assess my opponent), the reminders about <br/>
dog trail rules and etiquette may inflame the owner, then I'd have <br/>
two adversaries.  I think I'm going to try a passive/aggressive <br/>
approach and when the fur has finished flying and all is calm, I'll <br/>
ask to take a photo of "good doggie" and owner.  Turn photo into <br/>
trailmaster.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone !!!<br/>
