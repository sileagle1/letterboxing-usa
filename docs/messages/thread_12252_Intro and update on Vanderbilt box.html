<br/>
We've been lurking for a couple of weeks and went out on our first hunt today.<br/>
<br/>
We are the Alphabet Bandits, Talking Turtle (me),  Cheetah Chick, Daring Dragonfly, Beautiful Butterfly and Krazy Kiwi.  Lacivious Lion had to work.   The other half of our group is still working on their handles. We are a group of two homeschooling families in the Hudson Valley.  We are in the process of starting a series of boxes in our area.  The clues to the first one will be published sometime during the next couple of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
The day turned our to be a bit chillier than predicted, especially on the banks of the Hudson River. Thankfully the few raindrops that made us panic on the way there subsided as quickly as they appered.  We almost gave up, due to rapidly deteriorating moral... Daring Dragonfly was drooping.  After bypassing our landmark, and walking a loooooooong way past our mark,  we backtracked to find the box in good condition.  Just a note to anyone visiting the box, read "rock wall" as "natural rock wall" and you'll be fine.   In an area of former farmlands, we were looking for manmade objects.... we even found one, a good about 15 minutes past our mark.  Thank goodness we didn't keep going!  We forgot to see when the last entry was (sorry).  The lid of the box has a tiny crack at the edge, but the box and it's contents were dry.  We stamped in repacked and rehid.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Katydid for a great first experience.  If you are need us to replace the box, let us know, as we'll be headed back that way in a week or so, (Lacivious Lion wants in on the act), and can do it for you.<br/>
<br/>
Ready for next week's jaunt...<br/>

Hopefully you guys will put some great boxes in the<br/>
area.  Im in D.C. for school and I won't be home for<br/>
another month or so, so if you guys do happen to pass<br/>
by replacing it would be lovely!  There are some great<br/>
trails in the area... I was thinking of putting some<br/>
along the trail from vanderbilt's to FDR's home. <br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
