letterbox nearby me, that is set on a nature trail.  The local troup <br/>
of boy scouts put up nature info signs, and marked trails, but <br/>
unfortunately, thought that where the letterbox was placed would be <br/>
not seen by people, being that it was on the oppposite side of a rock <br/>
wall, and they vandalized with paint.  I think my response to this is <br/>
not only in appreciation to your sons remark (how smart and witty for <br/>
a young boy!), but also an embellishment to the Leave no Trace rule, <br/>
considering we DO leave stuff:  If possible, make it better than when <br/>
you found it.  I've called the troup, and they've made arrangements <br/>
to clean the area they disturbed, and I'd be happy to help.  In any <br/>
case.   On another note.... I dreamt about letterboxing... now THAT'S <br/>
obsession.  Anyone having this issue?  I think maybe it is because <br/>
it's raining here all week, and I have to compensate for the staying <br/>
inside factor..... <br/>
