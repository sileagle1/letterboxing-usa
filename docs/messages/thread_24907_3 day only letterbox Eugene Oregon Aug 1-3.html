So I am on the east coast in Beantown and will be travelling to Eugene <br/>
Oregon to sell my artwork at the festival Faerieworlds <br/>
(www.faerieworlds.com) and figured i would do a special letterbox for <br/>
the event, so if you happened to be in the area and are so inclined to <br/>
enjoy up to three days of wonderful music and such, come see me for a <br/>
limited time box. you can recoginize my booth by checking out my <br/>
artwork at www.lennonstudio.com and if you see me and call me dragonfly <br/>
I will give you the clues. hope to see you there!<br/>
