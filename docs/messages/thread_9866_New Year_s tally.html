an end-of-year tally of the total number of existing boxes?  That <br/>

We're really growing by leaps and bounds! In October I went through <br/>
and counted them all up, but never got around to updating the front <br/>
page of the website. The tally then was 3925. 2002 has been, by far, <br/>
the biggest year of expansion for letterboxing.<br/>

Happy New Year!<br/>
