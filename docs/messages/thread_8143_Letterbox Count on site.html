<br/>
<br/>Got a question for the web masters. How often do you update the counts of boxes in states and around the country? I noticed that it hasn't changed since July, and lots of boxes have been launched since then. If this is something you guys would either want or need help with, I could give it a go. :-)

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, Mike! We'd love some help with this. We used to have a "script" <br/>
that went through and counted, but nowadays it's done by hand, one <br/>
state at a time. (there are also some non-state pages to look at, <br/>
like hitch hikers, international, mystery, carribean). Some states <br/>
(like CA) have the count on the main page while others (like CT) are <br/>
mixed in to the regional pages.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what it adds up to and I'll update the home page. You're <br/>
right that there has been a big increase in the numbers!<br/>
