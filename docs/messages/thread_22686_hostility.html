(or more p.c. "sportspersonship") have largely lost their meaning. We see it<br/>
when irate parents attack coaches or players on the field; we also see it<br/>
when people attack each other on this list. It doesn't hurt to be nice,<br/>
pleasant or gracious. It actually feels good (I promise!) and makes the<br/>
world a just a little bit better.<br/>
