&gt; <br/>
&gt; From I-40 going toward Birmingham, exit on I-65 south to the first <br/>
&gt; Old Hickory Blvd. exit. Take a right and go to Granny White Pike, <br/>
&gt; then right on to Otter Creek until it dead ends.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Park in the lot and continue up the hill on foot. About the time <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; run out of breath, there will be a Handicapped Parking sign on the <br/>
&gt; left. Turn there and head down the path, with the water out to your <br/>
&gt; right. About half way down on the right, there is a dead tree <br/>
covered <br/>
&gt; with ivy in front of a smaller leaning tree.<br/>
&gt; On the left is a tall stump with the top burned away. The letterbox <br/>
&gt; is behind this, covered with bark.<br/>
