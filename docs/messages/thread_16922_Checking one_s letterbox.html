Check it as often as you'd like.  I've placed boxes that I have no <br/>
intention of EVER checking up on (particularly those in Africa).  The <br/>
only time I really go out of my way to check my boxes is if I've <br/>
gotten reports that it might be missing.  Otherwise, I leave sleeping <br/>
boxes alone.<br/>

Here are some considerations:<br/>
CLUE TYPE<br/>
For those whose style of clue writing involves natural (temporal) landmarks that <br/>
change over time it would be wise to check it seasonally if not more often. I <br/>
recently found that one of my most cherished places is in jeopardy of severe <br/>
erosion and the trail will most likely be gone in the not too distant future. That <br/>
for one is a consideration (initially) when placing a box.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some examples:<br/>
-fire<br/>
-flooding<br/>
-blowdowns (when a tree is uprooted and falls)<br/>
-ice storms<br/>
<br/>
For those of you not living in areas that are greatly influenced by 4 distinct <br/>
seasons well, then you're lucky. But for most of us we experience some mild <br/>
hurricanes, flooding, blowdowns and changes in the natural landscape.<br/>
<br/>
It would be wise to write a clue sheet that can be modified upon periodic <br/>
surveys of these changes. If it is a nearby area that you frequent it's easier. In <br/>
the case of an out of state box, I recommend that the placer recruit a "monitor" <br/>
or someone that can "caretake" this particular location and notify you (the <br/>
placer) when things change.<br/>
<br/>
For a mystery box/location - your best bet is to sit on it for awhile to see if <br/>
anyone can 1) solve the mystery and 2) to see what the feedback is.<br/>
<br/>
So - the natural landscape changes sometimes very slowly and other times <br/>
very suddenly - it depends on whether or not you want to leave your box in the <br/>
hands of mother nature and rely upon clues that do not change - or if you are in <br/>
a position to check on your box more frequently then be prepared to update <br/>
those clues more often.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

Yes, but there's an undeniable thrill in finding you've had visitors to your <br/>
very first box.   I didn't expect anybody to find my first one for months, but <br/>
I checked it after 3 or 4 weeks, just to be sure it was staying covered and <br/>
was so tickled to find people had been there already!   So if you have the <br/>
urge, go ahead and check it.<br/>

I think I'll take the advice of 2 different responders. I'll check in <br/>
a couple of weeks for maintainance/giggles, then every 3 to 4 months.<br/>
