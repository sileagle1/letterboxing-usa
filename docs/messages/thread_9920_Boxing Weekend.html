Saturday after a few weeks sans letterboxing.  First, we stopped at <br/>
Lily of the Valley, and despite the warning, got covered with ink!  <br/>
Next, we headed downtown to check on Mr. Jefferson's Microbox, and <br/>
we're happy to say that it's still in fine condition.  Our next stop <br/>
was a second attempt at finding Orion ... and I must say it's easier <br/>
in the daylight!  We headed across the Mall to plant the Independence <br/>
Microbox (clues forthcoming), and then down to the waterfront to find <br/>
the Ghost From the Titanic as the sun set over the river.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to the DC area gathering in 3 weeks ...<br/>
