<div>I have enjoyed reading everyone's interesting 
posts, and love seeing new clues for my area.  I think the "discussions" 
are great, regardless of topic.  My only problem is that I don't have 
enough time to read it all.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Has anyone established talk groups that are 
regional in nature?  I like keeping up to date on new clues, as well as 
being alerted to problems with boxes in my area (so I avoid too many 
disappointing searches).  I am also keeping a lookout for problems or 
questions people might have about boxes I have planted.  These are the main 
reasons I've stayed on the newsgroup.  I enjoy the witty banter, but it's 
not my main reason for logging into the group.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Are there any smaller groups out there for folks 
just in the North East, or state by state?  I don't want anyone to take 
this the wrong way, but I'm overwhelmed with messages to wade through.  
It's great that so many new people have come aboard!  I just don't like 
spending all afternoon (on a lovely day like today) trying to find relevant 
info.</div>

anyone be interested?</div>

I would be interested in a group that allowed only on-topic posts<br/>
and all complaints sent to the owner of the list only--and offenders <br/>
get put on review status.  However, I<br/>
would not be interested in a regional list because I think we learn<br/>
so much from reading other people's clues and experiences even if<br/>
they are in a different part of the country.  One way to stay happy<br/>
on a list like this one that does not have those restrictions is to<br/>
read the subject lines and delete the messages UNREAD that do not interest<br/>
you.  I mean, my delete finger is swollen today from deleting all<br/>
those messages with "newbie" in the subject line!!  <br/>
