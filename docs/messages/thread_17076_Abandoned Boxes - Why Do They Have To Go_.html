Letterboxes being deleted from the main list was<br/>
discussed and I'm not sure what was ever decided.<br/>
I expressed one solution to create a website to<br/>
house the clues and some people thought that was<br/>
a good idea, but others did not.  This got me to<br/>
thinking; why do we have to create a new place to<br/>
house clues that have existed for many years on the<br/>
main site just fine?  I can't believe they are being<br/>
removed because the website is running out of space.<br/>
If the reason is only because no valid email address<br/>
exists as an owner of the box, I still don't understand<br/>
why.  Based on past experience, many of the boxes with <br/>
owners currently active in letterboxing will become<br/>
abandoned in the future as they leave the hobby or<br/>
change email addresses.  If the reason is because<br/>
no owner is around to take care of the box, I still<br/>
don't understand why.  Many boxes (some of mine, too)<br/>
are placed so far away from an owner's home that they<br/>
are not likely to ever be checked on.  Does this make<br/>
them unworthy of posting on LBNA?<br/>
I am surprised how little attention this is getting<br/>
on the talklist considering we stand to lose a significant<br/>
number of boxes, some of which are very special and <br/>
represent much of the hobby's heritage.<br/>
I don't want to start a debate, I just want to save boxes.<br/>

I don't know the answer to all your questions, but the abandoned Lb's<br/>
are housed in their own little place here:<br/>
