WELCOME! This is a wonderful hobby full of great people. I have copied some information from Don's recent post to another new boxer. It's great stuff so check out the links below. Also, what area are you in? There are regional talk lists that have info on boxes and gatherings specific to your geographical area. With regard to stamp size I believe standard wisdom is not bigger than 3 X 5. But really, that's even a little too big. Lot's of folks plant micro boxes and use cash register tape or hand made small logs and the bigger your stamp, the less they will see of you image in their log. My son carved our team stamp and it's a little too big but I love it and will use it until it falls apart. But I would suggest keeping it on the small side. Lot's of folks carve erasers and they seem to stamp nicely in any log. Just my 2 1/2 cents. I am sure several others will have differing opinions.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, do what feels right to you for your image and hope to meet you on the trail someday!<br/>

here is about the size of an index card. A lot of us<br/>
use a ringed index card book as a letterbox log book.<br/>
You will find some smaller but those would be the<br/>
exceptions. My stamp could probably fit 4 images on an<br/>
index card. If I had to choose a new personal stamp, I<br/>
would personally go even smaller. Something small that<br/>
you can put in your pocket. The less you have to carry<br/>
the better.In the end though, it's all up to you and<br/>
what you want.....Chuck and Molly  <br/>

Daniel,<br/>
<br/>
As the owner of the Texas list, I highly recommend<br/>
setting up your own list for NM.  Our list is about a<br/>
year and a half old and it is growing by leaps and<br/>
bounds, but when I set it up there were a very small<br/>
handful of boxes and boxers!  When I set the list up,<br/>
I knew very little about letterboxing, having just<br/>
been at it a few months; however, I knew a little<br/>
about moderating a list.  I never claimed (and still<br/>
don't) to be the final authority on letterboxing, I<br/>
just made a place for all of us in Texas (and we have<br/>
a nice little contingency from Louisiana on our list<br/>
too) to gather and talk.<br/>
<br/>
If there are boxes, there are boxers, they just aren't<br/>
organized into a "group".  And even if there aren't<br/>
many, knowing and meeting one another will help the<br/>
ones that are there reach out and bring in other<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the Texas group goes, I invite you to join;<br/>
however, most of the boxing here is done in the<br/>
Eastern half of the state and our few lone West Texas<br/>
boxers really struggle.  In fact, they would probably<br/>
welcome a NM list!<br/>
<br/>
Stay with it Daniel, it'll be worth it!<br/>
