the mystery. I like taking out my hiking books and<br/>
checking maps, and realizing the error. I have enjoyed<br/>
reading the different types of clues. They give me<br/>
insight into the creator of the box, and often help me<br/>
to find the box when arriving at the appointed spot. I<br/>
personally like the loose structure of clue giving. It<br/>
gives me a chance to be Sherlock Holmes at times, or<br/>
just following step by step if my spirit leads me in<br/>
that direction. No matter what, it has  been fun<br/>
searching, and I thank you all for placing.<br/>

I do have one question: I noticed some people sign<br/>
