The site seems to say that you bring your own stamp and stamp the book in the box.  I think that the second is right, but what does everyone else think?<br/>

Hi ~*Sailor Moon Beam*~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No-one else has answered you yet ..so here's a reply from over the pond !<br/>
<br/>
I'm only a Dartmoor Letterboxer ..but the answer to your conundrum is,<br/>
"Both answers right!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.  The letterbox itself contains a stamp which "you" the letterboxer use<br/>
to take an impression.............<br/>
<br/>
............This goes in your COLLECTORS book and proves that you've been<br/>
there (to the box)  and "you" get a nice "impression collection" to show<br/>
off ..and get a nice F count.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2.  You have a personal ID...(Sailor Moon I presume ! <grin>) and "you"<br/>
make "your own" personal stamp for your identity...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3.   When you find a box ..You should find that it also contains a<br/>
VISITORS book !  SO...then also impress "your ID"  stamp  into THE BOX'S<br/>
vistors book !<br/>
<br/>
This proves to the next letterboxers that you have been there..and you<br/>
might leave them a message too !<br/>
<br/>
A stamp impression exchange in fact ..!  Nice !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On Dartmoor we pull in our boxes ..so as not to be litterbugs ..after say<br/>
2 years ..and the box owner gets to keep their VISITORS BOOK...<br/>
<br/>
The record in the vistors book makes a cool record of all the letterboxers<br/>
who followed their clues to their box too !  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Easy Peasy !<br/>
<br/>
And its so much just plain crazy fun!<br/>
<br/>
The game ..(as someone here says most times) ..is afoot  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
... Bilbo to the recsue !<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing<br/>
