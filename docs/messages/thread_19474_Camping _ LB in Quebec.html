                    <div class="plaintext-content">    Excellent timing, this.  Diane and I planted a box on the Ile d'Orleans, and we need to get the clues onto the website.  There's also Poutine, which I mentioned before (maybe before Anna's time) which we found but the stamp was missing so I carved a new one.  I'll write you privately about where to get good poutine and caribou stew and letterboxes!<br/>
    Meanwhile, don't anyone ever worry about the language barrier in Quebec City - it's a tourist destination and gobs of hoteliers and store folks and waitstaff and all are bilingual.  Like most of us, they only look for simple courtesy.  I've seen less patience here in the States with folks who are struggling with English.<br/>

  We're considering traveling to Quebec to camp and sightsee (mostly around the Southern parts) in a couple weeks and wondered if there are any kind souls on here who like to share information and would have fairly recent experience with this. If so, thank you in advance for emailing me privately at annalisa@fast.net   Sounds like there's not much letterboxing activity up there, but I'd like to know about that too. Will check teh archives.  Possibly we could plant some.   With such short notice, I'm wondering how challenging it might be to find camping spaces, and also how much of an obstacle my rusty French will present in terms of finding such places to stay.
