I'm considering doing some boxing this weekend, after I drive my daughter to Montpelier, VT. <br/>
<br/>
Any recommendations for boxes along the way? I'll be driving up 93 and 89 from Somerville, MA through part of NH. <br/>
<br/>
Sadly, I sprained my ankle last weekend, so can do anything too strenuous. But I've been missing the hunt and am considering coming out of retirement. <br/>
<br/>
Now, if only leger would. Sigh.<br/>

<br/>
You could try for Rolling Rock and Braintree Panther boxes. They were the 2nd and 6th boxes in Vermont. They are only about 10 minutes away from Exit 4 off I-89.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could go the Kimball Library in Randolph and look for the KPL Letterbook. If you decide to try for this, you will want to do some research online before you go, I think. Please let me know if you decide to do this, and I will check with the librarian and make sure everything is in place for you.<br/>

Have a great week-end in any case.<br/>
