The more simple ones encourage me to put away my fears and try my own <br/>

The Mad Chef box we placed yesterday features a comic creation by my <br/>
11 year old - carved by her as well. She did a stamp carving at <br/>
Moosehill Audobon Art camp this summer, so she instructed us on <br/>
finding the proper tools. <br/>
Both my children to have more artistic talent than I, so in our <br/>
family it is often my kids who are encouraging me with undeserved <br/>
compliments than the other way around. <br/>
<br/>
I think their attitude is good - you just have to try and you usually <br/>
get something attractive, if not a professional masterpiece.<br/>
<br/>
Most of all, I try to have fun with this. It's a family activity for <br/>
us.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">---We started out with store bought stamps just because we were <br/>
anxious to get hunting. I wanted to see how others did their stamps <br/>
without missing out on the thrill of the find.  Now that I have a <br/>
good idea, we have started carving our own.  I used to be intimitated <br/>
by the quality of the stamp. Now I'm just nervous about how to write <br/>
up my clues.  The Turtle (age 12) says not to fear she has it all <br/>
figured out. Such a comfort!!!!  <br/>
