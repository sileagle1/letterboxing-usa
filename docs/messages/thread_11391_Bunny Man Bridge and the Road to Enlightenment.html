On Friday, Johnny Nomad and I along with my mom, Winky, headed out <br/>
for some hunting.<br/>
And lo and behold... WE were the first finders of the Bunnyman Brige <br/>
Box! *happy dance* Living in Clifton, I knew where the brige was, <br/>
before the updated clues. :) <br/>
Then off to the library to seek the Road to Enlightenment. And we <br/>
were successful there as well. <br/>
But the Letterbox Book, after 2 and a half hours was still not ours <br/>
to find. Maybe next time.<br/>
<br/>
All boxes were is great shape! Happy hunting, all!<br/>
