&gt; &gt; 1. A few letterboxers have expressed that their letterboxes <br/>
should be on<br/>
&gt; &gt; their own web page, since the clues may be part of the design.<br/>
<br/>
I would think, as was suggested by someone else, that the original <br/>
clue pages could still be linked to.  Couldn't there be a cental <br/>
database, including fields such as name of box, state, county, <br/>
difficulty, date hidden, mystery location, owner/contact, kid <br/>
appropriateness (?), and probably others too.  A search would simply <br/>
return a list of links to the clue pages.  The box owner, when <br/>
submitting the clues could decide which field to populate.  Some <br/>
clues (mapsurfer, drew, orient express,...) will not lend themselves <br/>
to be databased, but most will.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2. Letterboxes are considered "copyrighted material", so cannot be<br/>
&gt; &gt; centralized into one database.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think that would be a concern if the clues aren't copied or <br/>
changed.  If the owner submits fields and links to the database, I <br/>
can't imagine anyone objecting.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3. A few letterboxers fear others "profiting" from their <br/>
letterboxes (by<br/>
&gt; &gt; providing advertising, selling a book, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
www.letterboxing.org is ad-free so if the database resides there, <br/>
there shouldn't be any concern.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; (did I miss anything?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>

I think you correctly identified the issues that were raised at the <br/>
time.  As stated above, I think they're fairly simple to get around, <br/>
although I lack the technical expertise to do so.<br/>

Eric, Jeremy, Jay, others?, does any of this make sense?<br/>

I guess the "spin the bottle" of responsibility has been foisted on me<br/>
to announce... well, actually not much.<br/>
<br/>
The group of us that comprise the "webmaster" list have been tossing<br/>
around the database &amp; tabular clue "maps" for several weeks now.  We all<br/>
agree that the current map dots and laborious updating method is very<br/>
near to being overloaded. Mitch and others have presented some<br/>
interesting working models that we are trying to reach concensus on so<br/>
we can present something to the general list.  At present, the best I<br/>
can offer is "stay tuned"...<br/>

Thank you for your brief update of the "behind-the-scenes" <br/>
discussions that are on-going.  I don't think those preclude a <br/>
healthy debate in a more public forum like this list, and allows for <br/>
those who may have ideas/input/expertise to contribute that.  Seems <br/>
harmless to me to discuss these issues in public...<br/>
<br/>
Along the same lines, do the "webmasters" have any procedure in place <br/>
that allow the members of this list (well over 150 now) to be <br/>
regularly updated on  their activities, or perhaps even "listen in" <br/>
on their discussions?<br/>
<br/>

No harm &amp; we certainly aren't trying to keep anything secret!  I believe<br/>
the archives are open to public viewing.  As you know John, we have the<br/>
webmaster list in place so we keep the nuts &amp; bolts off this list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Along the same lines, do the "webmasters" have any procedure in place<br/>
&gt; that allow the members of this list (well over 150 now) to be<br/>
&gt; regularly updated on  their activities, or perhaps even "listen in"<br/>
&gt; on their discussions?<br/>
<br/>
Again, I think the webmaster list archives are open to the public.  We<br/>
are just trying to keep the day to day maintenance &amp; minutae off the<br/>
letterboxing list.  While this move will be much more than trivial, most<br/>
of the subscribers in the past have felt that this list should be <br/>
reserved for letterboxing &amp; not website construction!<br/>
<br/>
As for viewing the tabular models, I'll leave that up to the various<br/>
creators.  As stated before, we are really trying hard to come to a<br/>
consensus on how everything will fit together to meet everyone's needs.<br/>
