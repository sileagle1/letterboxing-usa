                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just visited an historic landmark administered by the USDA Forest <br/>
Service.  I told them about letterboxing and they were very exited <br/>
about the prospect of having a letterbox on their site with clues <br/>
based on interpretive information from the tour of the grounds they <br/>
give.  The administrator had her laptop available and went right onto <br/>
letterbox.org while I was there.  I think this could be the beginning <br/>
of a beautiful relationship.  It might be just the foot in the door <br/>
that U.S. letterboxing needs in order to create a mutually beneficial <br/>
relationship with public land management agencies. <br/>
<br/>
Now here's the neatest thing about this place I was at. (BTW I'm not <br/>
going to name it in case they want to make it a mystery box.)  On the <br/>
grounds of this landmark is an historic building that is know as "The <br/>
Letter Box!"  Can you believe that?!?!? It's what actually got me <br/>
thinking about letterboxing.  When I saw the picture of the building <br/>
on the interpretive sign by the parking lot labeled "Letter Box" I <br/>
thought it was a clue to the location of a box on the property.  I <br/>
went into the gift shop and asked a uniformed employee about it and <br/>
quickly surmised that there was no connection to letterboxing.  As I <br/>
explained it to them their eye grew wide with excitement.  I'm going <br/>
to check into their web site to continue the dialog.<br/>
<br/>
The Forest Service only administers 2 historic landmarks in the whole <br/>
country.  Can you figure out where it is?   <br/>

Cool! I found it! Now I gotta go there! This would be an ideal place for a<br/>
letterbox, and I am thrilled that your conversations with the folks there<br/>
were positive!<br/>

That's a good question.  Right now there's no uniform policy that I <br/>
know of among public land managers.  It's reception is likely to <br/>
depend on the discretion of the individual manager.  That will depend <br/>
on what their first exposure and understanding of letterboxing is.  I <br/>
would suggest that if you want to approach a specific area's manager, <br/>
do it before you've taken the time to plan out the box.  <br/>
<br/>
You want to make their first impression of letterboxing a good one.  <br/>
Just make general inquiries as to whether or not they've heard of it <br/>
and try to sell them on the advantages.  <br/>
<br/>
The main one is that it brings people there.  That's their "bread and <br/>
butter."<br/>
