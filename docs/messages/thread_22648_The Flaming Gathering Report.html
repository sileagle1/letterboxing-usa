After looking at your wonderful 'report' of the Flamingo Caper, it is obvious <br/>
all of you involved have set the bar very high concerning letterboxing <br/>
events! The photos were fabulous!!<br/>
<br/>
I only have one things to say: Having had the pleasure of meeting Deanne when <br/>
she was out here in California last year, and now finding out she was the <br/>
concept person for this spectacular event, you ALL MUST get her to change her <br/>
trail name. The Lazy Letterboxer simply doesn't suit her as it's obvious it took <br/>
a great deal of time and most of all her creativity! <br/>
<br/>
Kudos to you, Deanne and all who participated in this amazing event!! <br/>
