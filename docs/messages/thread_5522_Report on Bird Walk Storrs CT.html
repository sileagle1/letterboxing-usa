has a hole in it. Didn't have one on me to replace it. The Great Blue <br/>
Heron had a bit of water in it almost like moisture. Nothing was <br/>
damaged and I dried it out with a paper towel. Might want to check it <br/>
out. I can't figure out how any water got in at all. I think it also <br/>
needed a new plastic bag. Great walk. Molly really enjoyed the <br/>
Fenton. You can't keep a Lab from water. Thanks for two enjoyable <br/>
boxes.....Chuck &amp; Molly<br/>
