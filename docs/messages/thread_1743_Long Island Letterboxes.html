                    <div class="plaintext-content">Spent a long time Sunday morning hunting the Green Belt Trail #1 <br/>
letterbox.  We're satisfied that we found the right fallen tree, but <br/>
found no sign under all the snow of the letterbox.  This was my 2nd <br/>
hunt for this box, but came up empty again.<br/>
<br/>
Greenbelt #2 "Whisper" was found and I was the first to stamp in.  <br/>
Neat to be first, but a shame this one hasn't had more visitors in <br/>
almost a year.  It's a great trail and seeing "Whisper" (better known <br/>
to me as The Smithtown Bull) brought back memories.  Looks like <br/>
Whisper is surviving the youth of today better than he fared in the <br/>
60's and 70's.  The town was forever having to repaint....well, best <br/>
left at that.<br/>
<br/>
Didn't make it to Montauk....that'll be another trip.<br/>

FWIW, I stamped in at Whisper on 7/11/99.  Perhaps the log book<br/>
had been replaced.<br/>

Yes, I guess it has...perhaps when it was moved to it's new spot in <br/>
March, 2000.  Sorry, Randy.<br/>

I thought I would post here that two new letterboxes have been placed<br/>
