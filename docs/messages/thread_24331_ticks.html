In all honesty, welcome to the great outdoors.  Ticks, mosquitoes and <br/>
other nasty bitting insects are commonplace here. <br/>
<br/>
Here is a list of suggestions for preventing them:<br/>
<br/>
-Wear light-colored clothing so you can more easily see ticks.<br/>
-Wear long sleeves buttoned at the wrist and long pants tucked into <br/>
socks. Take a hat to protect your head.<br/>
-Walk in the center of trails to avoid brushing up against dense <br/>
vegetation where ticks hide. Avoid sitting directly on the ground, use a <br/>
blanket or towel.<br/>
-Do a tick check every few hours or more often if in heavily infested <br/>
areas. Visually check clothing and exposed skin. At the end of the day, <br/>
do a final, full-body tick check.<br/>
-Use an insect repellant containing DEET. Lightly spray clothing, <br/>
especially children's, and avoid direct contact with skin.<br/>
-Remove ticks as soon as you detect them. Do not touch them directly, <br/>
use a tweezers or tissue and do not crush the insect until it is <br/>
separated from the skin and placed in a disposable container.<br/>

<br/>
I've heard that taking garlic pills can keep ticks off of you. It's <br/>
supposed to take 2-3 weeks for the pills to take full affect -- some <br/>
people double the dose the day before and of their outdoor activities.<br/>
<br/>
It also seems to be fairly common for dog owners to feed garlic pills <br/>
to their pooches as a natural tick deterrent.<br/>

To remove the tick flip the body over( not turn it around but flip it) and <br/>
pull out. That straightens the pinchers and they come outthe way they go in. <br/>
Truly!!!<br/>
Maybe someone can explain it better.<br/>

 -Use an insect repellant containing DEET. Lightly spray clothing,<br/>
 especially children's, and avoid direct contact with skin.<br/>
 -Remove ticks as soon as you detect them. Do not touch them directly,<br/>
 use a tweezers or tissue and do not crush the insect until it is<br/>
 separated from the skin and placed in a disposable container.<br/>

The best tick preventive I know of is 100% pure DEET insect repellent.  <br/>
Lesser concentrations are effective against most other biting insects <br/>
(skeeters, gnats, black flies, horse/deer/moose flies, et c.), but DEET <br/>
in it's highest concentrations (90%) works best against TICKS.<br/>
Especially when combined with long sleeves and trousers -- blouse your <br/>
trousers into your boots/sox for the ultimate fashion statement/tick <br/>
protection... :p  By the way, try to minimize applying 100% Deet to <br/>
your skin (some folx, and most young children, are sensitive to it) by <br/>
applying it onto your clothes: on a hat, at the collar, wrists, waist, <br/>
ankles, any other "openings" where ticks will find a way under your <br/>
clothes.<br/>
<br/>
I, of course carry bug dope (yep, 100% deet) but choose shorts, t-shirt <br/>
and sandals for 'boxing and rarely use bug-dope...your milage may <br/>
vary. ;)<br/>

&gt; In all honesty, welcome to the great outdoors.  Ticks, mosquitoes <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; other nasty bitting insects are commonplace here. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here is a list of suggestions for preventing them:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -Wear light-colored clothing so you can more easily see ticks.<br/>
&gt; -Wear long sleeves buttoned at the wrist and long pants tucked <br/>
into <br/>
&gt; socks. Take a hat to protect your head.<br/>
&gt; -Walk in the center of trails to avoid brushing up against dense <br/>
&gt; vegetation where ticks hide. Avoid sitting directly on the ground, <br/>
use a <br/>
&gt; blanket or towel.<br/>
&gt; -Do a tick check every few hours or more often if in heavily <br/>
infested <br/>
&gt; areas. Visually check clothing and exposed skin. At the end of the <br/>
day, <br/>
&gt; do a final, full-body tick check.<br/>
&gt; -Use an insect repellant containing DEET. Lightly spray clothing, <br/>
&gt; especially children's, and avoid direct contact with skin.<br/>
&gt; -Remove ticks as soon as you detect them. Do not touch them <br/>
directly, <br/>
&gt; use a tweezers or tissue and do not crush the insect until it is <br/>

<br/>
I don't know about that -- 100% seems awfully <br/>
high for use on your skin. The CDC says to "Use <br/>
insect repellent with 20% - 30% DEET on adult <br/>
skin and clothing to prevent tick bite." Another <br/>
study showed that "Repellents containing more <br/>
than 33% DEET have not shown to be significantly <br/>
more effective than lower concentrations." I've <br/>
used 100% DEET on my skin and invariably would <br/>
end up with a rash when I did. Also, 100% DEET <br/>
also eats through nylon, so you have to watch out <br/>
if you apply it to clothes or boots.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;By the way, try to minimize applying 100% Deet to<br/>
&gt;your skin (some folx, and most young children, are sensitive to it)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but even worse -- seizures have been <br/>
reported in young children who have come into <br/>
contact with high concentrations of DEET. DEET is <br/>
a neurotoxin and can be dangerous to the old as <br/>
well as the very young. The American Academy of <br/>
Pediatrics warns that children not be exposed to <br/>
any insect repellent containing more than 10 percent DEET .<br/>
<br/>
I think it's more prudent for an adult to stick <br/>
with a repellent with 29-33% DEET (and children <br/>
to use one with 6.5% DEET with frequent <br/>
reapplications) in conjunction with wearing <br/>

rollers. Roll it all over yourself (and your boxing partners) and it <br/>
will pick up any ticks which are on your clothing.  You can roll it <br/>
over yourself after you've removed your clothing too for good <br/>
measure.  The captured ticks can then be dispatched via any of the <br/>
aforementioned methods (burning them is my personal favorite).<br/>
<br/>
I've also used permethrin spray with good results, though it takes <br/>
advance planning since your clothes need to be treated ahead of time.  <br/>
Note that this is only for treating clothing, not for treating skin.<br/>

<br/>
When you get home, remove your trail clothes immediately and throw<br/>
them into the DRYER for a cycle.  I don't think ticks can live through<br/>
that like they can a wash cycle.<br/>
<br/>
Then of course, do the full body check when you get home.<br/>
<br/>
I've also read that you can carry one of those sticky lint<br/>
removers...the tape type removers and run that over yourself, skin and<br/>
clothes, before getting into your car.  The adhesive should be strong<br/>
enough to hold captive any loose ticks.<br/>
<br/>
Use Deet!  It's nasty but ticks are worse.<br/>

necessary.<br/>
<br/>
In 1984 Gwen and I were on our first Grand Canyon raft trip and none of <br/>
the small group had ever been on the canyon. This made for scouting <br/>
most of the rapids and also a terrific adrenalin burn. Really highs and <br/>
lows were the order. We had but three boats and 5 folks so the trip was <br/>
pretty exhausting as there was work every day and no off days. In those <br/>
days Gwen wore contacts and due to the dryness of the canyon she had to <br/>
slosh eye drops in several times to keep her eyes moist. On evening <br/>
number 12 I woke up to her screaming "you trying to kill me!!!!"<br/>
She had put %100 deet into one of her eyes in the middle of the night. <br/>
Fortunately she had contacts on. The deet had totally destroyed the <br/>
lense but better the lense than her eye.<br/>
<br/>
Small %100 DEET bottles are the same size as eye drops, and when you <br/>
get that tired you do strange things. <br/>

&gt; high for use on your skin. &gt; Yes, but even worse -- seizures have <br/>
been <br/>
&gt; reported in young children who have come into <br/>

&gt; a neurotoxin and can be dangerous to the old as <br/>
&gt; well as the very young.<br/>

We used to get ticks when we were kids on weekends and vacations "up <br/>
north" (a term used to describe just about anywhere in the northern <br/>
half of Wisconsin).  However the yuckiness of getting a tick was offset <br/>
by the fun of burning them.  After we removed it, my parents used to <br/>
let us kids light a match and burn the tick to kill it!  The other <br/>
approach we used in our tents at night was to keep a spring-type wood <br/>
clothes pin in each of our tents.  If we found a tick at night we would <br/>
squish it with the clothespin (not as much fun as burning!).<br/>
