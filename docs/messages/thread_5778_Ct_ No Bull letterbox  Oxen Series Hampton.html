                    <div class="plaintext-content">Come to pastoral Hampton .Ct. via rte 6 and turn onto Rte 97. This <br/>
will lead you into  the village of Hampton , a idealic community of <br/>
old time New England not tarnished by 20th century to any degree. <br/>
Pass the Grange Hall , Post Office and General Store and follow the <br/>
rte to the junction of Station Rd. Bear left on Station. You will <br/>
come to the junction of the rail trail and see the station  off to <br/>
the right behind trees &amp; such. You will take the left trail near the <br/>
blue house, there is parking here.  Soon upon this 1.3 mile trail you <br/>
will pass between two ponds covered in pond lilies. Then again <br/>
dipping into the woodland where the trail narrows and the raspberries <br/>
cling to your pant leg. Well that may only be if you have a  team of <br/>
oxen pushing you toward them. Wish they had been ripe! We are out <br/>
here recreating our families 1772 journey from Killingly to <br/>
Mansfield ,Ct.  Two teams of oxen and two boys and Mom. We travel <br/>
down the trail noting old stone walls and other remnants of farming <br/>
in a bygone era.  The woodland  is close. When you come to a section <br/>
of trail where the woods opens up and on the right you look far down <br/>
in to a wooded glen  look here for a pile of cement and stone someone <br/>
left. The pile a little larger than a campfire hides the No Bull <br/>
letterbox. If you reach the White trail crossing you went to far <br/>
backtrack a little. Here , where we met Chuck, Molly and Chickabirdie <br/>
who helped to hide this box we rested oxen and weary feet and enjoyed <br/>
the good company of friends.  This is the No Bull box as oxen are <br/>
castrated cattle of any breed used for draft work. We have Scooby <br/>
Doo, and Shaggy with us . The second team is Ben and Al,( Al went <br/>
home tired as he is much younger than the others ). Ben came along <br/>
the rest of the way solo. If you continue on you will arrive at 11 <br/>
Section Rd. then it is another 1 1/2 miles to Goowin Forest State <br/>
park. Or you can turn back. Thanks all  and goodluck . <br/>
