                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last week Crawdaddy and I went out to the West Virginia/Virginia<br/>
border and hiked from Wolf Gap to Big Schloss.  BEAUTIFUL View!  2.2<br/>
Mile hike one way - (4.4 miles up and back).<br/>
<br/>
We HAD to place boxes there, because there were none on the LBNA site<br/>
for that area.  So we placed one in Hardy County, WV and the other in<br/>
Shenandoah County, VA.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, we posted the boxes we placed on the LBNA site, but one<br/>
doesn't show when you see the list of VA boxes, so I thought I'd let<br/>
you know about them.<br/>
<br/>

necessary) the address below into your browser.<br/>

Directions to both boxes are below.<br/>

The Guardian of Big Schloss<br/>
Placed by: Poison Ivy<br/>
Placement date: Aug 2 2003<br/>
State: Virginia<br/>
County: Shenandoah<br/>
Nearest city: Columbia Furnace<br/>
Number of boxes: 1<br/>
Clues<br/>
This 2.2 mile (one way) trail starts at Wolf Gap Campground.<br/>
Take exit 279 off I-81, turning West on SR 675.<br/>
Follow SR 675 to STOP sign at VA42 in small community of Columbia Furnace.<br/>
Turn right on VA42, then left off VA42 back onto SR675, now called<br/>
Wolf Gap Road.<br/>
Make sharp left turn after crossing one-lane bridge to stay on SR 675.<br/>
Go 3 miles and bear right after trash collection station.<br/>
Ascend, still on SR675, for 3.4 miles.<br/>
Wolf Gap Campground is on your right in the gap. Park there.<br/>
<br/>
At Wolf Gap campsite 9, take orange blazed trail marked with a sign<br/>
that says Big Schloss and Mill Mountain.<br/>
Follow the trail for two miles.<br/>
You'll come to another sign that says Mill Mountain 4 with an arrow<br/>
ahead, and Big Schloss 1/4 with an arrow right. Turn right and follow<br/>
the trail up to Big Schloss - you're almost there.<br/>
<br/>
Once you reach Big Schloss, sit down, enjoy the view. It's absolutely<br/>
fabulous.<br/>
Once you can breath again....<br/>
<br/>
Go to the Northern most point of the rocky outcrop.<br/>
Turn around. Almost due South is a large dead tree growing in the<br/>
gully of Big Schloss.<br/>
Just South of that is a crevice in which two smaller trees are growing.<br/>
At the second tree, look up to where the branches begin to split.<br/>
There, to the left of the brances, is a shelf of rock. In that shelf<br/>
behind another wedged rock is the Guardian of Big Schloss.<br/>
You'll have to climb a little to reach it.<br/>
I hope you can find it. If you can't at least the view was worth it.<br/>
<br/>
AND since you're here, you just passed the Wolf Gap letterbox placed<br/>
by Crawdaddy!  Let me know how you liked Big Schloss.<br/>

You'll come to another sign that says Mill Mountain 4 with an arrow ahead,<br/>
and Big Schloss 1/4 with an arrow right.<br/>
<br/>
At the sign, look into the woods at 100* and you will see a dead tree<br/>
about 10 yards in.<br/>
Behind this dead tree, about 15 feet up on the rock ledge is the Wolf<br/>
Gap stamp.<br/>
<br/>
To get to the stamp, take 23 steps up the Big Schloss trail.<br/>
At the protruding rock in the path, turn right off the path and walk<br/>
past the dead tree to climb up the hill to get up on the rock ledge<br/>
that is directly next to the tree.<br/>
The box is hidden in the ledge?s rock wall opposite the dead tree.<br/>
<br/>
While you are this far up the trail, only 1/4 further is Big Schloss.<br/>
The view there is amazing, and Poison Ivy?s - The Guardian of Big<br/>
Schloss stamp can be found there.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you thought of the view at Big Schloss -<br/>
