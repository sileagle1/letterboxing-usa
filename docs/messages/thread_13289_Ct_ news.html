Search of The Dragon of Krafow."<br/>
The stamp is soooo great. A nice sweet walk on the woods road.  Got to <br/>
get out my maps and see where that road  goes.  !  I always wonder what <br/>
is just around the cornor .   Nice rocks, little water falls and <br/>
wildflowers. Thanks Chuck and give a pat to my buddy Molly.<br/>
Happy days.<br/>

Today a crew of us went out and braved the heat, mosquitos and deer <br/>
flies as we felt we were really on a Safari..  The Elephant Stamps made <br/>
the whole hike worth while . As we swatted at bugs and oohed and ahhhed <br/>
over each stamp, we moved along, drinking all our water, and finding no <br/>
energy to hunt up The In Search of Sasquatch.  So back we will go <br/>
another day.  It was great fun to be in the company of Snow Angel from <br/>
Ohio in Mansfield on a visit. Leader of the Pack along with Cowboy and <br/>
Cody made up our troupe in the wild south Safari in School House Park in <br/>
Mansfield.  It was a fun day . Thanks to Chuck and Molly for a great <br/>
adventure and wonderful stamps.  Leader of the Pack picked up the Cuckoo <br/>
, I was as excited as she. I was the first to find it a year ago last <br/>
Christmas and   have wondered about it ever since. Now they will have <br/>
the fun of finding its nest  It is a Jay Drew adventure and so much fun. <br/>
Enjoy it, Leader of the Pack.  and thanks to all for a fun day.<br/>
