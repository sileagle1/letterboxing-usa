If - I don't think the event stamp will come to my state, and<br/>
If - I'm pretty sure that the event stamp will be quite nice, and<br/>
If - I was contributing in some way to the event<br/>
Then - I wouldn't be shy about asking (nor would I jump on anyone else who wanted) to get an image of the event stamp.<br/>
<br/>
I greatly admire the craftsmanship of my fellows in the hobby.  It would help me to commemorate the happening of the event.  I wouldn't count it as anything, just enjoy the work put into it.  For some, it's not about the numbers, but appreciation.<br/>
