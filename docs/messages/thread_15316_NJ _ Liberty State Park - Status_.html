First off, it shouldn't be listed in NJ as officially it's in Kings County NY.  But that <br/>
aside, the box is missing, and from researching the archives, it appears to have gone <br/>
missing as far back as July 2001.  I have asked the webmasters to either remove the <br/>
listing, or add a line at the top that it may be gone since it requires effort, time and <br/>
money to reach this non-existant box, but I just checked and it doesn't appear to <br/>
been changed.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Princess Lea...  I had seen the archived messages from June <br/>
and July 2001, but thought perhaps they were cases of "just couldn't <br/>
find the box."  But it sounds like this one isn't going to be worth <br/>
the time and effort, and most likely is long gone.<br/>

I'm sure this technicality doesn't change the fact that the Statue is considered to be part of New York but I found it amusing that New Jersey could steal the Statue of Liberty with garbage.  : )<br/>
