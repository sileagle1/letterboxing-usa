I enjoy reading everyones adventures and finds.  I understand this is <br/>
supposed to be a secret society:) but I think with all the media <br/>
thats gone, but I will enjoy sneaking around bushes like a secret <br/>
agent.  I don't know if I'm brave enough to do the fly arms thing <br/>
(YET)<br/>
<br/>
My children and I are going on our first hunt today. Bok Towers.  I <br/>
can't wait until I find some boxes so I can get a feel for what goes <br/>
into them.  Then FL will have a few more boxes to find.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have any boxes in my backyard per say however know of some <br/>
geocaches.  I don't have a GPS so really can't search for them until <br/>
I can invest. (Not for a while)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry so long winded.  Look forward to becoming an active lbxer.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Kat, welcome! :) I am also one of the 'Family Fun newbies'.And like <br/>
you and your children, my grandson and I are going on our first hunt <br/>
today. We are in South Texas, and Texas doesnt have all that many <br/>
letterboxes either...122, I think... and being such a large state, <br/>
many are much to far flung to be able to just 'pick up and go' to <br/>
get them. In our area, there are only 6 planted within drives of <br/>
about an hour in various directions. <br/>
<br/>
If things go right today though I should be able to plant the 7 I <br/>
have made though. After we find our first letterbox, we plan to <br/>
drive to another area and plant them. Then my #3 son and I hope to <br/>
drive to yet another area and plant more later this week, if I <br/>
manage to get more stamps carved and boxes filled. He was at the <br/>
area overnight yesterday, and scouted around for some good locations.<br/>
<br/>
I can't answer any of your questions, but I 'think' a 'micro-box' is <br/>
one that is very small, such as a plastic film canister or an <br/>
Altoids box... maybe. The letterboxes I have made and hope to plant <br/>
today, are one regular sized one (Rubbermaid square box) and six <br/>
film canisters. I was greatly encouraged by the postings about it <br/>
not being necessary to include a stamp pad in planted boxes.... <br/>
therefore, the small film canister letterboxes...<br/>
<br/>
Well, it is time to go pick up my letterboxing partner. I hope to <br/>
hear how your hunt went later today.... I know I will report as soon <br/>
as I can when we get home. ;D<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!!!!<br/>
