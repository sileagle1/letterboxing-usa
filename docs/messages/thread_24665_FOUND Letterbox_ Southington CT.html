<br/>
My name is Jeff, I am a geocacher.  I have found a few letterboxes also.  I was recently out <br/>
Geocaching in Panthorn Park in Southington CT and my search brought me into and area that <br/>
I found a Letterbox in.  The container was opened and all the contents where spread around <br/>
the area.  I did not find the stamp that was in the container, but I was able to recover the log <br/>
book (although damaged severely from being in the weather) and the container and a few <br/>
items that were on the ground in the area.  <br/>
<br/>
The name of the Letter box had worn off and I could not figure out whose it was by searching <br/>
all the clues to all the Southington Letterboxes in the area.  <br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering if anyone here has a Letterbox in that park or knows anyone that does.  <br/>
If no one claims it in a couple of weeks I am just going to get rid of the stuff.<br/>

First - thanks for the recovery and using this talk list to find the rightful owner.<br/>

Can you describe the stamp's image. We've boxed there before and hopefully we can help. <br/>
You can contact us directly (off list) at our email address in the header of this post.<br/>
