through <br/>
&gt;   LbNA. The problem is there is nothing to tell me which letterbox <br/>
they <br/>
&gt;   are writing about. <br/>
<br/>
This problem is even more compounded when the update refers to a <br/>
series of letterboxes.  The link sends you to the clue page but it <br/>
doesn't mention which particular letterbox in the series to which <br/>
the letterboxer refers in their comments.  Is there a way to further <br/>
specify to which specific letterbox in a series the 'contactor' <br/>
refers?  That would make life much easier for the planters of many <br/>
boxes/series of boxes out there.  I have one 'multi-box' series in <br/>
particular that often experiences this problem--it involves 6 boxes <br/>
and rarely, if ever, do visitors specify which letterbox they <br/>
visited or failed to find in their comments to me.  At some point in <br/>
the future, I figure I'll go separate and individually list all <br/>
these multi-box series  to avoid this problem in the future.<br/>
