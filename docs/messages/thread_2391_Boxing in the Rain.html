Striker play and the games are called for rain....go boxing, of <br/>
course!<br/>
<br/>
Less than 5 miles from the hotel where I said goodbye to my daughter <br/>
who would be spending a long, boring afternoon and evening "cooped <br/>
up" with a U-17 boys team from Long Island, NY (YIKES!) is Fort <br/>
Belvoir and the Accotink Bay Wildlife Refuge.  This area is the site <br/>
of numerous short, but lovely trails and three letterboxes.  I was <br/>
able to add two of the stamps to my journal despite the rain and <br/>
flooded trail.  The Beaver Pond Trail was flooded and roped off <br/>
between "Beaver" 180 and P "9" L.  Figured there was more than one <br/>
way to bag this box so I retraced and reversed the loop until I could <br/>
pick up the rallymaster's clues.  This format was a lot of fun!<br/>
<br/>
I'll be heading back up tomorrow hopefully to watch some soccer, but <br/>
if not, there's always Leesylvania State Park and five boxes to hunt.<br/>

carry a large clear plastic bag with me. I have one that is roomy <br/>
enough to put my arms inside all the way up to my elbows so that all <br/>
the rest of the business of stamping in stays nice and dry. A crude <br/>
