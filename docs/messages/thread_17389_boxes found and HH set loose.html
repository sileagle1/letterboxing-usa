<br/>
While vacationing in Pennsylvania this week we went in search of my <br/>
5oth letterbox.  And we found it!!!!  the Battle of 1775 boxes are in <br/>
great shape and fun to find.  The only concern was that we had to go <br/>
around a chain and a sign that posted "private  property" to get to <br/>
Captain Moore's Insignia.  If I hadn't been so desperate to get my <br/>
50th before the new year I might not have gone through with it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, while we were there I placed my hitchhiker, "Just A Note".  If <br/>
you are kind enough to give it a lift, I would love to hear of it's <br/>
travels; "just a not" will do....<br/>
