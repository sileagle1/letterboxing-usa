OK everyone... All of you folks who got skunked<br/>
on the Art Guru event by Ma Nature, <br/>
hop on the next plane to Oregon. We've been <br/>
suffering from unseasonably warm and <br/>
dry weather. As awful as the drought will be <br/>
next summer, having 70 degree days and <br/>
cloudless skies in March is glorious.  <br/>
<br/>
There are at least a gazillion letterboxes <br/>
in the Pacific Northwest just waiting for <br/>
frostbitten letterboxers. Just be sure to bring a <br/>
couple of barrels of snow as luggage to melt <br/>
for water. There may not be enough on hand <br/>
here to drink.<br/>
<br/>
Wait one dang minute! Who needs water? This is <br/>
the land of the microbrew. First round is on the <br/>
Hog!  <br/>
<br/>
Keep warm, Funhog<br/>

Speaking as a frostbitten letterboxer who has previously ventured to<br/>
the Pacific Northwest (aka Letterbox Heaven) during a freezing Midwest<br/>
Feburary, I will agree with our little piggie of all things fun, on<br/>
all counts.  There ARE at least a gazillion boxes in the PNW ... and<br/>
the Hog knows where to find great adult beverages. (Long live the Free<br/>
Range Red microbrew!)  <br/>
<br/>
I must warn you though, after boxing in the PNW, getting addicted to<br/>
garlic fries, and meeting the most wonderful fellow boxers, I've never<br/>
been the same (hey! not like THAT!) and I can hardly wait to go back.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
