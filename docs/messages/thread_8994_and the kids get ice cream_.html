The last time we went on a hunt, the kids got cream puffs for lunch.<br/>

What is life with out a couple of desserts for meals every once in a while?! <br/>

Those are good cream puffs. The cream puffs that my kids wanted are <br/>
sold at a Japanese food store in San Jose, CA. They are big, fresh <br/>
and YUMMY. We give them an A++.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &gt; &gt; P.S.  I hear there's a new frozen custard place opening -- maybe <br/>

<br/>
Yum that sounds good! Maybe one day for breakfast, but I would have <br/>
to take a red eye flight since I live on the west coast.;) <br/>

  We just traveled all the way down to Florida with <br/>
&gt; two kids under 8 to get cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory (o.k. <br/>
so the <br/>
&gt; trip was really to see Great Grandma -- but the chocolate chip <br/>
cookie dough <br/>
&gt; cheesecake was up there too!)<br/>
<br/>
Your reward for traveling such a long distance with kids.<br/>
Bookworm has always been an excellent traveling companion, but <br/>
Lizardbutt gets bored very quickly.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; P.S.  This is one of the really weird things about these lists -- <br/>
it seems <br/>
&gt; like everyone is just around the corner when they may be miles (and <br/>
miles <br/>
&gt; and miles) away!<br/>
