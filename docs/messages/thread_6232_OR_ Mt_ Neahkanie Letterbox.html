stamp. The box - including the logbook - was pretty wet but <br/>
salvagable at this point. We replaced the baggie, hope that helps. <br/>
We would have tried to dry the logbook a little more but Grace <br/>
wasn't cooperating as she loves hiking but only as long as we are <br/>
moving. Perhaps the next visitor can try to dry it out better.<br/>
