                    <div class="plaintext-content">It would seem that two of the five boxes in our series are a bit too<br/>
popular, now having gone missing for a second time. I've decided it is<br/>
pixies, enchanted by them - the kids aren't buying it, but I still like the<br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
Since neither of those box locations has any "good" hiding spots that<br/>
haven't failed us, we are going to be making some fake rocks to test out. We<br/>
actually intend to place a fake rock in a high traffic area nearer to us so<br/>
we can keep an eye on it closely to make sure our attempts at Sir<br/>
Balthazar's tips turned out realistic enough. So for at least the next week<br/>
or two, the last two boxes (Spider and Gnosis) are missing from this series.<br/>
