NAME:  Double EIGHT (Ditto?)<br/>
       Second Box in the Nolde Forest Series<br/>
<br/>
LOCATION:  Nolde Forrest Environmental Education Center, located on<br/>
           PA Route 625 south of Reading, Berks County, PA.<br/>
<br/>
DATE PLANTED: October 2002<br/>
<br/>
Nolde Forest Environmental Education Center is designed and <br/>
maintained to promote environmental education.  Bicycles and <br/>
motorized vehicles are not allowed. Please hike only on designated <br/>
trails. All route choices use existing Fire Roads, Trails, or Paths <br/>
(FR/T/P).  All boxes in this series are located close to trailsides. <br/>
All routes involve elevation changes. Maps of the center are not <br/>
entirely accurate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
START HERE: From the location of Double Seven, continue on the <br/>
(FR/T/P) in the direction that you were heading until you meet <br/>
another (FR/T/P). Turn right, and continue until you see the Double <br/>
Arrows. (EE 25 means you have gone too far  Double Back!)  From the <br/>
Double Arrows, follow MAH plus 90 degrees, ignoring the (FR/T/P) <br/>
coming in on the left until the FR/T/P meets others. Take a sharp <br/>
right, ignore the (FR/T/P)'s coming in on the left and pass the gray <br/>
stone structure on the left. Continue until this (FR/T/P) meets <br/>
another.  Turn right, pass a (FR/T/P) coming in on the right, and <br/>
continue to a triangle with trees in the middle at the top of <br/>
the "steps".  Go right at the triangle, then take the first left and <br/>
continue until you find this point(P):  SS/ FF and EE and LL. Near <br/>
this point find the Double Numbers 00 and 44. Note the two digit <br/>
number following 00 and the two digit number following 44; subtract <br/>
the smaller from the larger, divide by 2 to get a number(#) of <br/>
paces.  Return to P,  Double Back at heading 340 degrees for # paces <br/>
to where 00 and 44 are at 200 degrees and a rock is at 160 degrees. <br/>
Look at heading 270 degrees, between Double Logs, to find Double <br/>
Eight.<br/>
