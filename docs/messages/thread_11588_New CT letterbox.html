                    <div class="plaintext-content">Letterbox Name: Book Barn <br/>
Placed by: Christi, Jeff and Liam<br/>
Number of boxes: 2<br/>
Date: March 29, 2003<br/>
City: Niantic<br/>
County: New London<br/>
State: CT<br/>
Time needed: 15 minutes to find the two letterboxes, endless hours to wonder <br/>
around and find wonderful books<br/>
Directions from North or South Interstate 95 to the Book Barn Take exit 72, <br/>
for Rocky Neck State Park. At the end of ramp, turn left at traffic light. <br/>
Proceed 2.1 miles and the shop will be on left. From 395 or Route 9, proceed <br/>
South to Interstate 95 and then follow the above.   <br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in finding out more about the store visit their web <br/>
site<br/>

<br/>
       As you enter the grounds of Book Barn go up the stairs on your left <br/>
into the main building.  Enter the building, make your way to the back corner <br/>
of the barn to find the door that leads to the basement (downstairs). You'll <br/>
have to leave the building through the backdoor for a moment to get <br/>
downstairs.  Follow the stone stairs down to the door at the back of the <br/>
barn.  Find your way to the corner with books about Birds, Horses and Kitty <br/>
Literature.  Notice the hole in the corner with the cement ramp.  You will <br/>
find the Book Barn letterbox nestled in the hole under the shelves/bench.  Be <br/>
careful not to push it to far under the shelves or the next person will not <br/>
be able to reach it.  <br/>
       Head back out of the basement once you've replaced the box.  Retrace <br/>
your steps to the main floor of the barn.  Feel free to look at the many <br/>
wonderful books on all three floors. Once you have gone back out the front <br/>
door head past the friendly goats on your way to the Last Page.  You may want <br/>
to stop first at the Underworld just to read the sign.  It always makes me <br/>
crack up.  Once you enter the Last Page here are your clues:<br/>
       Letterboxing is no laughing matter but you'll find the More than <br/>
150,000 books letterbox in the Humor corner. I'm 5ft 6in. and I can reach the <br/>
letterbox, there are stepping stools around if you have trouble. Please place <br/>
the letterbox back where you found it.<br/>
        When you leave the Last Page check out the other buildings, there is <br/>
truly something for everyone here.  I hope you enjoy Book Barn as much as we <br/>
do. Make sure to say Hi to the many animals and Randi, the owner, too.<br/>
