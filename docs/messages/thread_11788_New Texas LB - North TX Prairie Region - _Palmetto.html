Palmetto State Park takes its name (so does this letterbox) from the <br/>
dwarf palmettos which thrive in the park's swamp areas.  The Civilian <br/>
Conservation Corps (CCC) built a huge outdoor pavilion in the park, <br/>
as well as a water storage tower and hydraulic pump, picnic tables, <br/>
grills, walkways and rock entrances.  Palmetto is a great bird <br/>
habitat for almost 250 native and migrant species.  The park also <br/>
offers many hiking trails, camping, fishing and showers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
The "Palmetto" letterbox is located in Palmetto State Park, close to <br/>
I-10 near San Antonio, Texas.  From San Antonio, go east for 60 miles <br/>
to Hwy 183.  Turn right (southeast) on Hwy 183 for about 6 miles, <br/>
turning right on Park Road 11 for 2 miles to the park.  Pick up a <br/>
brochure at the headquarters, and check out the 1st area of the park <br/>
(where the Oxbow Lake is).   Then proceed to the second section of <br/>
the park, parking your near Palmetto Trailhead, by the Picnic area <br/>
and CCC building.<br/>
