<br/>
It is my personal opinion, that as long as you have created your stamp to the best of your:  ability, capabilities and satisfaction, it does not matter what it looks like. I am in no way shape or form an artist... I'm arts and crafty, but most of my drawings are piteous at best.  We cannot compare our stamps to anyone else's as we are all so different in our abilities, whether they be physical, mental or financial.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm now sorry we posted the images, as I'd hate to think the ones posted so far have deterred anyone from sending what they were previously satisfied with.<br/>
<br/>
Warrior Woman, I love yours... it is simple, elegant a straight to the point.  When a person sees it, unless the live on a small island off the coast of Pago Pago, they should recognize it.<br/>
<br/>
Kerri, I'm sure your stamp is great, please don't change it on account of something you've seen posted.<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm done and taking the lemur with me.<br/>

I'm thinking though I should rethink my subject, and pick something more<br/>
pointed toward my abilities, something with lots of straight lines, for<br/>
instance. Please, don't worry about discouraging me, when I see such great<br/>
stamps, it encourages me to try harder, and analyze how you all got such<br/>
great results. I doubt if I will ever get much better than I am as I refuse<br/>
to spend very much on my medium (Navy wife, 3 kids, 2 race cars, there's not<br/>
a lot to go around) but I'm determined to be the best eraser carver I can<br/>
be! LOL! I've already found a new image to attempt, and will let you know<br/>
how it goes. Thanks for the words of encouragement,<br/>
