<br/>
Team BeMa (at least the young and spry members -- Dad had to work...) got up <br/>
early to splash in the dawn dew with Puddle Duck (when you have little kids <br/>
they get up REALLLLLY early even if it is school vacation and, somehow, <br/>
especially if it is a weekend!...).<br/>
<br/>
We got there before the library opened and were actually very excited to see <br/>
other cars there thinking they might be more boxers to meet (having overcome <br/>
our initial shyness we are now like grandma BeMa who talks to EVERYONE <br/>
[grocer, dry cleaner, person next in line...])  Unfortunately and <br/>
fortunately, they were just dog walkers and assorted joggers.  <br/>
Unfortunately, because we are psyched to get more exchanges and fortunately <br/>
because we were able to be the first ones to log into Puddle Duck.<br/>
<br/>
We had good luck with the clues (we tried to read them very carefully this <br/>
time and put up our "hand-L" to verify right and left and found the box all <br/>
snuggled in with its head under its wing or at least its Tupperware under a <br/>
nice pile of leaves, twigs and bark.<br/>
<br/>
We took the opportunity to run over to the box office of the Alden Theater <br/>
at the community center next door.  Even though it was closed (doesn't <br/>
everyone keep the same hours as Target, 7-11 and us?) we were able to get <br/>
the latest listing of shows.  They have some great and very inexpensive <br/>
programs (good for younger kids because they are short yet the theater looks <br/>
like a real theater so they can learn proper "show behavior"....)<br/>
<br/>
Now it's back to writing up the clues for our box which is already planted <br/>
and waiting to be discovered!<br/>
<br/>
