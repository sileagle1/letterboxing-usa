                    <div class="plaintext-content">I add ink and just when it was getting expensive I found my first <br/>
drew box and they had a litlle square ink in it. I checked our local <br/>
rubber stamp shop and they carry little oval ones which are much less <br/>
expensive and take up very little space. I found I can do a multiple <br/>
color image if I choose too. If someone inadvertantly finds the box <br/>
as we found one yesterday they are all set to carry home an image <br/>
whether they have letterboxing supplies with them or not. Just 2 more <br/>
cents. In any event if its a budget thing plant the box  I'd rather <br/>
have more to look for than have it skipped over an ink pad. By the <br/>
way I found that even in deep snow and very cold the ink worked a pen <br/>
from a box we had to chip ice from to remove wrote too. I was <br/>
amazed.April school vacation right around the corner I can't wait! <br/>
Letterboxing without freezing I hope. Be on the lookout for my new <br/>
boxes coming vacation week.   Carol - in counting days til vacation<br/>
