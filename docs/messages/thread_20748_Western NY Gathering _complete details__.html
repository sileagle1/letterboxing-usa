Here's all the details for the Western NY Gathering...make sure to <br/>
RSVP to dasprite222@yahoo.com if you're coming or you want to make a <br/>
box to send to us gor the gathering (using the theme "Something I'm <br/>
Thankful For").<br/>
<br/>
General Info: It's still on November 13th from 11:00 to 6pm (might be <br/>
changed for daylight savings time) at Royalton Ravine County Park. <br/>
It's on Gasport Road in Gasport, NY, but has no number address, so <br/>
just look for the chunk of green on your map. Here's the link from <br/>
Western NY Regional Info. http://www.wnyrin.com/c_niag/comm/park-<br/>
rec/park/royat_roya.html<br/>
<br/>
Boxes: Boxes will be placed all over this park for this event, most <br/>
of which will be picked up a month afterward. Clues will be available <br/>
to print off from our website the week of the meet (don't worry, <br/>
those of us living around here have promised to wait until Saturday <br/>
to search!).<br/>
<br/>
Accomodations: The nearest larger towns are still basically villages, <br/>
but they do have some accomodations. Lockport &amp; Medina will put you <br/>
within 15 or 20 minutes of the park. Here's a link for bed and <br/>
breakfasts in Medina: http://www.bedandbreakfast.com/medina-new-<br/>
york.html<br/>
<br/>
As far as cheap hotels, there's one in Medina called <br/>
Dollinger's...you can check that out here<br/>

<br/>
If you're coming from the east, you'll end up taking the Pembroke <br/>
exit off the NYS Thruway to take Route 77 up here, but you'll also <br/>
pass the exit at Batavia. Right at both exits, there's a few chain <br/>
hotels...the first two on this link are right at the Pembroke exit <br/>
itself, basically...not sure about the others <br/>

<br/>
Getting Around &amp; Other Boxes: If you want to make a weekend out of <br/>
it, don't forget that Niagara Falls is only about 40 minutes away <br/>
from where we'll all be, so you've got quite a selection of boxes. <br/>
Check out LBNA for the permanent boxes in Niagara, Orleans, Genesee <br/>
and even a little Erie &amp; Monroe counties (Buffalo &amp; Rochester, <br/>
respectively) or just do a city search of Gasport, NY on Atlas Quest. <br/>
Mapworks sells an EXCELLENT map of the Western New York area with all <br/>
the little side streets and rabbit runs, so you might want to invest <br/>
the 4 or 5 bucks on one.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know (Team Dakota, the Elba Onions, or the Sprite &amp; the <br/>
Highlander) if WE can be of more help. We're thrilled to be having <br/>
our first gathering and are putting out more than 30 boxes for you to <br/>
find at the park and the surrounding areas. If you know of anyone <br/>
else that's interested, please feel free to pass this info along to <br/>
them! We have about 20 people coming, some of which are from as far <br/>
as CT, MA and Canada...you could be one of them! (Mansfield's Monster <br/>
Mash was about a 6 hour drive for us, so use that to help you gauge <br/>
your trip time!)<br/>
