                                The Old L&amp;N  Railroad Depot<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      I had originally intended to take you on a walk up a section of the railroad, past the type locality for "Canton Schist", a <br/>
silvery garnetiferous rock, then on to the remains of a water tank foundation. An old dam, the foundation for a hydraulic ram, <br/>
and part of an old pipe that carried water to the tank are that's left of the days of steam trains on the old L&amp;N railroad that had <br/>
a spur through Canton. It must have been around 1946 that the steam trains were replaced by diesel engines.<br/>
<br/>
     I checked the CSX information pages and found that the current operators consider the <br/>
railroad to be business property; moreover, they consider walking on the railroad bed to be <br/>
trespassing. Whups! Delete Plans! Go to Alternate B!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox Name: The Old L&amp;N Railroad Depot<br/>
<br/>
Location: Holly Springs, Cherokee County, GA<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Very easy. You can park within a few yards of the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Date Planted: July 12, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Planted by: Jimmus and SpikesMom<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
1. If driving north on I-575, get off at exit 14 and turn right. Go to Holly Springs, and you will see the old train depot on the left.<br/>
<br/>
2. Turn left and drive around behind the depot and park.                        <br/>
<br/>
3 . The depot has been restored and now serves as a community center for olding meetings.<br/>
<br/>
The building can also be rented. The Cherokee Beekeepers Club held a holiday dinner function at <br/>
the depot some years ago, and it is elegant inside. The meeting was wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
Walk around the building and examine the architecture. Isn't it lovely? At Woodstock, to the south, the depot has also been <br/>
restored, but at Canton the depot was demolished. Can you imagine the days when trains ran on regular schedules, when <br/>
passenger coaches were included on the trains? Can you imagine the huffing and puffing of the steam engines? The sound of <br/>
the train whistle as it approached the station? Alas, those days are gone forever. I wish that you could see and hear those <br/>
trains... nostalgia, nostalgia...<br/>
<br/>
4. Now for the letterbox! First, find a marker that commemorates the birth place of Julian Hughes. Read the inscriptions, what <br/>
he said about Cherokee County. Indeed there are still some <br/>
beautiful areas in the county.<br/>
<br/>
5. Subtract the day of Mr. Hughes' birth from the first two digits of the year he was born. The result is the number of paces you <br/>
should take, on an azimuth of 110 degrees from the <br/>
marker, to get near the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
6. The letterbox is to your right,behind a pillar of the old freight house. After you have exchanged stamp impressions and <br/>
written any comments you wish, please replace the box carefully.<br/>
<br/>
Look at the different materials used as pillars for this building: bricks, field stones, sections of wood...in the days when these <br/>
buildings were put up there were no "Home Depot" or other building supply stores. You simply used whatever was available! <br/>
<br/>
Jimmus and SpikesMom hope that you have enjoyed this vist. Look around this small but beautiful town. You may find a store <br/>
that has exactly what you have been seeking.<br/>
<br/>
Please Note: The usual disclaimers apply: You are responsible for your own safety. Do not <br/>
trespass on private property. Be aware of animals, plants, and environmental situations that <br/>
might put you, and others with you, in danger. It is a good policy to wear brightly colored <br/>
vests and caps in the woods during hunting seasons.<br/>
