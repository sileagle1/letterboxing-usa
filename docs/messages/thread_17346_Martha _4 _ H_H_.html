                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I got the best surprise today when I came home from a trip to the outdoor store for more camo tape! Martha was waiting by my mailbox. Thankfully it wasn't too cold and I hadn't been gone long, but she was still giving me that 'look', like how dare you make me wait OUTSIDE!, but she kept looking between me and the house, I didn't quite understand that till later.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I hustled her in and she was visibly upset by the condition of our home. The day after Christmas and not a single decoration (if you don't count the holiday cards I hung on an interior door). I tried to explain that we hadn't planned to be in our home for Christmas, we were going to be with family. Also, having 4 dogs and a mischievous cat in the house, I worried that decorations would be damaged or ingested- that's when the earlier look registered as "WHY are there no decorations out here!". I also explained that my husband had caught a case of that nasty flu bug, so we didn't get to visit with family and decided to 'post pone' our celebration till he felt better. I could tell she wasn't buying any of my excuses.<br/>
<br/>
That's when she noticed the tumble weed size balls of pet hair rolling across the floor. I was really concerned that she would have a nervous break down right then and there! But then her demeanor changed. She shoved a package she had been clutching into my hands and started collecting the hair, muttering something about a sweater...and hat...and gloves...<br/>
<br/>
I tried my best to tidy up, but knew it was in vain. Meanwhile my husband is coughing so hard I thought a lung might come up. Martha stopped collecting fur and set to work making him some herbal tea that she assured us would have him dancing in no time. (I had to suppress a giggle at the thought of my husband dancing :-)<br/>
<br/>
While he was sipping his tea, he let it slip that I had been a police officer. That's when Martha vanished! I swear, one minute she was there, the next she was gone! I thought I heard her yell something about it being safer in MA, but I can't be sure. She didn't even take the fur she collected!<br/>
<br/>
Then I realized I still hadn't opened the package she gave me. I was again delighted by my luck, as it was the Maine Event Hitch hiker! Well, needless to say, with Martha likely in the next county already, it would be up to me to get this hitcher moving. I noticed some nice sized containers I had brought in from the woods and found one that the hitcher was comfortable in. I'll be setting those containers back out very soon. That should get it going again.<br/>
I'm sorry Martha couldn't have stayed longer, but to be quite honest, her visit was stressing us all out! :-) Look out MA!<br/>

"Martha doesn't live here...it's a good thing!"<br/>
