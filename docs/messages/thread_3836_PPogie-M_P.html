                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br/>
After a day of household chores on Saturday......I decided that today I'd <br/>
revisit the Merrill Creek boxes in North West New Jersey.<br/>
Both are in great shape and I am sorry you "missed" the first one but I was <br/>
delighted to see your stamp in "Charmed".<br/>
If you decide to go again, think of a "water or feed trough", for large <br/>
animals, easy to see with out the leaves on the trees, I was surprised to <br/>
see how low the water was, no eagles this time.<br/>
I know, I'm not supposed to give hints...ruins the fun.....but it is more <br/>
fun to find the letterbox!! Besides it's in the clues already....<br/>
Early this week on the way home I checked "Durham Furnace" and saw you had <br/>
stamped in there. Glad you found it, it was the "three bridges over water" <br/>
that I liked, wished I could have found a prettier spot to hide the box, oh <br/>
well....In the summer there is a rope swing close to the box that brings <br/>
much pleasure to folks of all ages who use it to swing out over the Delaware <br/>
and splash in to cool down!!!<br/>
Enjoy Life! 'Box On!!<br/>

                    <html><body>Glad to hear that "Foundations" is there.  Mary and I will have to go back and give it another try one of these weekends soon.  Since stamping in at Charmed we've visited a number of your boxes, See Joy, thanks!  
<br/>
<br/>For the last couple of weekends we've been letterboxing here in my area (northern New Jersey), but expect to be in Mary's neighborhood soon.  From there (Clinton) it's much easier to explore the Delaware River/Canal area. 
<br/>
<br/>And speaking of the Delaware, next spring we're planning on planting some letterboxes along the canoeable/kyackable rivers of NJ/PA.  I hope there are some boaters out there who are also letterboxers.  Of course, if the weather continues to be this warm, we may get them planted much sooner.
