                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today we went on our very first letterbox adventure!  On Wednesday of <br/>
this week I first read about letterboxing on the internet.  Had to <br/>
convince my dh it would be lots of fun.  Picked what looked like an <br/>
easy adventure at a place dh particularly liked, and off we went.  On <br/>
the way we made a quick stop at a rubberstamp shop and found two <br/>
stamps we could both agree on. (I had already picked our a.k.a. name <br/>
and we found stamps for that theme). <br/>
Arrived at the start of our adventure about 2 hours from home to find <br/>
out it was almost 90degrees.  Not the best weather for a hike in the <br/>
woods with lots of bugs.  Luckily the hike was short and the spot <br/>
chosen was perfect.  <br/>
Even thought the box was only planted a few weeks ago we weren't the <br/>
first to locate it.  Everything was in great shape.  Loved the hand <br/>
carved stamp!<br/>
Thank you Kittlekatz,<br/>

other!<br/>
<br/>
I too had to convince dh that this would be a fun thing to do.  And I<br/>
picked an easy hike in a place that dh likes.<br/>
<br/>
We had no trouble finding Nojoqui Falls and the Turtle.  The weather was<br/>
perfect and the park uncrowded.  We decided that boxers need a secret<br/>
handshake!.  Someone had visited the box just a few days ago, and we<br/>
couldn't help but wonder if there was anyone else searching while we<br/>
were.  The people we ran into on the trail didn't look like boxers, but<br/>
it would have been nice to flash a secret signal to see if anyone<br/>
recognized it!<br/>
<br/>
All in all, today was great start to a fun new pastime.  On the way<br/>
home, dh was heard to say "Well, that wasn't a bad way to spend a<br/>
Saturday afternoon"..................<br/>
