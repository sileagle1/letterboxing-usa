A Boxer's Night Before Christmas<br/>
by Ace Blazer<br/>
<br/>
Twas the night before Christmas<br/>
And all through the house,<br/>
My children were sleeping<br/>
And so was my spouse.<br/>
I sat 'neath the glow<br/>
Of my trusty desk lamp<br/>
Near midnight, finishing<br/>
One last hand-carved stamp.<br/>
<br/>
As I whittled away,<br/>
Tiny pink pieces falling,<br/>
I smiled to myself<br/>
On that cold night, recalling<br/>
An old man I'd met<br/>
In the mall's parking lot<br/>
A few nights ago<br/>
Who was in a tight spot.<br/>
<br/>
He'd seemed somewhat dazed<br/>
As he paced back and forth,<br/>
Mumbling to himself<br/>
"Now which way is North?"<br/>
I thought "Ah! A Boxer!<br/>
I know just what to do!"<br/>
And, pointing straight up,<br/>
Said:  "I haven't a clue!"<br/>
<br/>
His kind, bearded face<br/>
Grew a puzzled expression<br/>
And I realized this man<br/>
Didn't share my obsession.<br/>
It seems that I'd gotten <br/>
Our signals quite crossed;<br/>
He was no Letterboxer-<br/>
He simply was lost!<br/>
<br/>
I asked the old gent<br/>
If he needed a ride.<br/>
With a wink and a smile,<br/>
"No, thanks" he replied.<br/>
"I'm a long way from home-<br/>
Thank you for caring-<br/>
I was last-minute shopping<br/>
Now I've lost my bearing."<br/>
<br/>
"I can help you" I said<br/>
And without further thought,<br/>

&gt; "I'm a long way from home-<br/>

&gt; I was last-minute shopping<br/>
&gt; Now I've lost my bearing."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; "I can help you" I said<br/>
&gt; And without further thought,<br/>
&gt; &gt;From my bags I pulled out<br/>
&gt; A new compass I'd bought.<br/>
&gt; "I want you to have this<br/>
&gt; Your need's greater than mine.<br/>
&gt; I've an old one at home,<br/>
&gt; It will serve me just fine."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; "Thank you" he said;<br/>
&gt; "This is just what I need."<br/>
&gt; I smiled as we parted;<br/>
&gt; I'd done my good deed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Back in the present,<br/>
&gt; My carving now done,<br/>
&gt; I rose from my chair;<br/>
&gt; It was now half-past one.<br/>
&gt; I wondered where I'd hide<br/>
&gt; my new Yule-themed box<br/>
&gt; When there came from my door,<br/>
&gt; Three or four gentle knocks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I opened the door<br/>
&gt; And there in the cold,<br/>
&gt; Was a brand new compass<br/>
&gt; With a case of pure gold.<br/>
&gt; Attached was a note<br/>
&gt; Written neatly in red:<br/>
&gt; "Thanks for helping. -S.C."<br/>
&gt; Was all that it said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I stood alone, puzzled<br/>
&gt; As I looked around<br/>
&gt; And then from afar<br/>
&gt; Came a jingling sound.<br/>
&gt; I then heard a voice<br/>
&gt; I'll recall til the end:<br/>
&gt; "Merry Christmas,<br/>
&gt; And Happy Boxing, My Friend!"<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You should always help<br/>
&gt; Others in need, for you see,<br/>
&gt; You just never can tell<br/>
&gt; Who they really may be!<br/>
