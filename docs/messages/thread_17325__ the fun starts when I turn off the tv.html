&gt; And now for something totally off the topic of letterboxing:<br/>
&gt; My xxxremovedxxx gift to all letterboxers is this gentle reminder (and <br/>
&gt; shameless plug) to watch this movie with friends and family.  And <br/>
&gt; since it is on for 24 hours straight you have no excuse for missing <br/>
&gt; it!  <br/>
<br/>
(unless of course you're poor and don't have cable)<br/>
or<br/>
you're from Maine...cuz I don't know the show and I don't watch TV. I<br/>
prefer my television to continue it's productive use as dust magnet<br/>
and fireplace ornament. But, thank you for the suggestion.<br/>
