Box #26: Two Battles<br/>
Location: Somewhere in New Jersey<br/>
Placed: 03/29/2002<br/>
Difficulty: 2/5 stars; A half hour of easy walking. Some very small<br/>
hills.<br/>
Clue page: http://www.pcdx.com/pclg/clue26.htm<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you about a dream I had. It seemed so realyou know how dreams =<br/>
<br/>
can sometimes be more real than reality itself. I suddenly felt so lost, so=<br/>
<br/>
displaced. I could sense that something was missing, something precious and=<br/>
<br/>
its memory was fading. Something in my dream led me to recapture that fond =<br/>
<br/>
memory that has been lost since 1971.<br/>
<br/>
To do so, I was to begin in the parking lot, facing the Visitors' Center en=<br/>
trance <br/>
and take the Southern Path.<br/>
<br/>
So, let me finish telling you my dream. It's all coming back to me now. Las=<br/>
t <br/>
night I took a walk after dark to a swinging place...that's where the girls=<br/>
 are. <br/>
The girl I sat beside was awful cute, and when I could, I gave that girl a =<br/>
hug. <br/>
We ate and ate at a hot dog stand and we danced around to a rockin' band...=<br/>
.<br/>
<br/>
Come with me now. Pass the Gun Battery...the Soldiers' Hut and Campsite and=<br/>
<br/>
at FL-36, continue South.<br/>
<br/>
At the next Battery, climb through the third opening. The trail is straight=<br/>
<br/>
ahead; follow it with the water on your left.<br/>
<br/>
And then the dream took an awful turn. A giant earth altering monster, <br/>
Winston Cente.... oh I can't even bear to finish the name, came and stood h=<br/>
is <br/>
ground against Irving Rosenthal and contracted to mark this spot forever. T=<br/>
he <br/>
music and laughter and cries of joy were slowly fading into the hiss of <br/>
rushing traffic. Now, I stood here at this convergence, this intersection o=<br/>
f <br/>
past and present, where my memories turned to stone,...<br/>
<br/>
The trail retreats to the North. Follow it and step over Wilbur, who was he=<br/>
re <br/>
last in 1975.<br/>
<br/>
Continue North East on the hardtop<br/>
<br/>
Before the familiar campsite, go Left at the fork, to the Slate and Wood Wa=<br/>
ll <br/>
and behind it.<br/>
<br/>
Everything had been swept away in a torrent, memories flying about like dus=<br/>
t, <br/>
landing everywhere. In a surrealistic whoosh, I too was swept away from the=<br/>
<br/>
not so distant past, to the present and this place that had witnessed the s=<br/>
tart <br/>
of the famous retreat through New Jersey in November 1776.<br/>
<br/>
The hard top ends and you continue with the traffic below you on the left.<br/>
<br/>
You've come down almost to street level, but are climbing again.<br/>
<br/>
As the trail climbs, it turns East.<br/>
<br/>
With large rocks ahead, at the Y, take the path at 30 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking back, during my dream, other than their somewhat geographic <br/>
proximity the connection between the two places escaped me,. Then I realize=<br/>
d, <br/>
they had both hosted battles; a battle of lives changing even as the land's=<br/>
 use <br/>
changed, the other indicating a crucial location in the history of a people=<br/>
<br/>
striving to be free. But, I wasn't dreaming now. . .<br/>
<br/>
To confirm your location, at 14 paces observe the Big V at 115 degrees. <br/>
Nearby, it looks like someone had a very big drill.<br/>
<br/>
At the next pit, you will have an angle as to where the memory you seek lan=<br/>
ded <br/>
and you will make the connection between the two battlefields that I made i=<br/>
n <br/>
my dream. Victoriously, you will re-claim the name that was and always will=<br/>
<br/>
be synonymous with the joy and thrills that had been lost. If you listen <br/>
carefully for the bygone voices, through the awful traffic's din, you'll he=<br/>
ar it <br/>
again: Last night I took a walk after dark, . . .A swingin' place . . .To h=<br/>
ave some <br/>
fun and see what I could see. You, too, will keep its memory alive in your =<br/>
