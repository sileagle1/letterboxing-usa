Calling all carvers!<br/>
<br/>
Last year, the Letterboxing Alphabet PLB Ring, wrapped up. 26 <br/>
letters, 25 carvers, tons of beautiful stamps, all about letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the fine carvers that participated in this ring forwarded <br/>
their stamps to me to place in the real world. Currently, I have 8 of <br/>
26 needed.  <br/>
<br/>
The plan is to place a Letterboxing Alphabet trail along the <br/>
Massanutten Trail in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.americantrails.org/nationalrecreationtrails/trailNRT/Massan<br/>
utten-VA.html<br/>
<br/>
This 71 mile circuit trail could easily hold the 26 letters (and <br/>
maybe a few surprises...8-D), one about every 3 miles. It crosses the <br/>
roads a few times, so finders wouldn't have to hike all of it to get <br/>
boxes, but then again, what a week it would be to hike and camp up <br/>
there...<br/>
<br/>
I plan on placing the boxes this fall and winter--this is where you <br/>
come in.<br/>
<br/>
Would you like to fill in the missing letters? You'll get credit as <br/>
the carver, I'll plant and write the clues. I'll also provide the <br/>
container and the logbook (but you can feel free to create the <br/>
logbook if you wish!).<br/>
<br/>
The key is that the letter you carve is predominantly displayed in <br/>
the letterboxing image. <br/>
<br/>
Any takers? Currently, I have D, J, L, M, Q, R, Y and Z.  A &amp; B have <br/>
also been spoken for.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
