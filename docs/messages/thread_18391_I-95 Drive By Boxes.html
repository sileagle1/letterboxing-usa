<br/>
Sue and I are headed to Atlantic Beach, NC the end of May and will be <br/>
traveling I-95 all the way down. Can any of you help us with <br/>
letterboxes in rest areas, or right off the highway? Our goal is to <br/>
hit at least one in each of the states we pass through - much to the <br/>
regret of our 20year old son and friend who will be traveling with us!<br/>
<br/>
Any help is appreciated. You may want to contact me off list so as to <br/>
not to clog up this talk list.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for your help.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! [on this gorgeous spring <br/>
day!]<br/>
