Pacific NW Letterbox Summit.<br/>
<br/>
Box 5 <br/>
I move slowly along the forest floor.  I eat tender leaves and leave my own<br/>
trail.  To find me, take the Vine Maple Trail.  Turn left onto the Big Fir<br/>
Trail.  At the next intersection, take the Ponderosa Loop Trail heading<br/>
almost due South.  The trail gets very curvy and a small side trail breaks<br/>
off heading west.  Take 14 goodly paces and you will be in a clearing.<br/>
Have a seat to look around,<br/>
Stinging Nettle does abound.<br/>
Near the path and on the trail,<br/>
you will see Im mostly tail.<br/>
South East from your seat a gnarled log resides right next to the trail.<br/>
Im hiding among the roots in a cozy spot.<br/>
<br/>
terrain: dirt path   difficulty: moderately easy  STINGING NETTLE<br/>
EVERYWHERE!!<br/>
<br/>
Box 6<br/>
I carry my home on my back.  I prefer to stay near the water where I can<br/>
move quickly.  I can hold my breath for a long time.  I eat just about<br/>
anything I can catch or pluck with my sharp beak.  To discover my hiding<br/>
place, follow the Vine Maple Trail.  When you are near my home you will see<br/>
(and smell) Skunk Cabbage.  Cross the steel bridge and the sound of running<br/>
water.  Just past the bridge, the trail climbs.  Log walls make a good home.<br/>
On the right side look for a small log.  I am hiding beneath.  This is a<br/>
very public spot.  Please be sure you are alone as you find or replace me.<br/>
<br/>
terrain: paved path   difficulty:  easy (handicap accessible)<br/>
<br/>
Box 7<br/>
<br/>
April 21 is Earth Day.  Do something for Mother Earth! Letterboxing is one<br/>
way to enjoy our natural environment.  Please stay on trails and help keep<br/>
our park clean by disposing of litter. Find the Earth Day Box by traveling<br/>
along the Vine Maple Trail past box 6.  Watch for an intersection of trails.<br/>
A large log sits diagonally on the right.  Have a seat.  Look inside the<br/>
hollow part. A piece of bark conceals the box.  Please replace the box as<br/>
you found it.  This is a busy spot!  Be sure you are alone as you remove and<br/>
replace the Earth Day box!<br/>
<br/>
terrain: paved path  difficulty:  easy (handicap accessible)<br/>
<br/>
Box 8<br/>
<br/>
I am seldom welcome at picnics, but I take my job seriously.  I help clean<br/>
up any environment I find myself in.  There are too many of my kind to<br/>
count.  To find me, follow the Vine Maple Trail to the Oak Trail. Pass<br/>
through the marsh and make a left onto the Creek Trail.  Be observant as you<br/>
go along.  Lots to see on this trail.  Watch for a small grove of 4  Cedar<br/>
trees.  From there, take 78 paces along the trail.  You will see a mossy<br/>
stump.  I am hiding in the stump, covered with a bit of bark and leaves.<br/>
Please disguise me as you found me!<br/>
