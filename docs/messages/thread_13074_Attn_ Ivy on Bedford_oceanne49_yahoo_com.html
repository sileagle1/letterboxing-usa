Here's what I'd written:<br/>

Hi Ivy,<br/>
<br/>
For some reason, it looks like your e-mail came only to me, not to the larger <br/>
list-serve.  Anyway, here's some info about letterboxing that I hope will be <br/>
useful.  If you haven't already, check out www.letterboxing.org.  If you <br/>
click <br/>
on the book, it will open to a map; from there you click on the state you're <br/>
interested in, and from there click on the region within the state that you'd <br/>
like to explore.  The boxes listed should be current.  <br/>
<br/>
If you'd like to check out the nationwide list-serve site: from the <br/>
letterboxing.org main page, click on the rubber-stamp that says "Talk List."  <br/>
You can <br/>
read the messages without signing up, but if you want to send a message, you <br/>
need to sign-up (the address is letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com).  <br/>
<br/>
I think that should set you in the right direction--if you have any <br/>
questions, feel free to give me a shout!<br/>

&gt;&gt;Hi... I live in the Hillendale Park area and I was sent the info on <br/>
<br/>
this site from my friend that lives in NY.  We are both rubber <br/>
<br/>
stampers.  (Totally her fault) She loves to buy stamps and take stamp <br/>
<br/>
classes in her NY town.  I love paper and to carve rubber. I also <br/>
<br/>
like making journals, papercrafting and etc. I am so excited to have <br/>
<br/>
these little journeys to look forward to.  I am making a special <br/>
<br/>
journal just for the purpose.  I hope to hear from someone re <br/>
<br/>
location of boxes and how current the info all is.  Thank you,  Ivy <br/>
<br/>
