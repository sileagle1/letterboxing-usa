Yes, we are staying at Witch Meadow.  We'll be there early Saturday, and we'll<br/>
stop by rocky Neck during the afternoon to see if anyone is lolling around.  <br/>
I erased all of my F's because I don't remember how many I had.  It'll<br/>
definately be easier to go for them the second time around, having been there<br/>
and all. <br/>
The hardest part is a new stamp image.  I only have a day to get one, which<br/>
doesn't give me sufficient time to carve one.  I know what I'm looking for,<br/>
but when you know what you want, it always makes it more difficult to find it<br/>
:)<br/>
But even if I have to show up stampless and Garth Brooks-less, I will see all<br/>
of you in CT!<br/>

Kim, call me a paranoid-schizo, but could this be a conspiracy? Could <br/>
the car break in bozo also be the letterbox vandal who has <br/>
maliciously attacked innocent boxes from Ohio to Dartmoor? Could it <br/>
have something to do with the recent increases in Justice Department <br/>
aggressiveness? Is someone "else" reading this list, maybe with a <br/>
foreign accent and a big mustachio?<br/>
<br/>
Re: Salem, are you staying at Witch Meadow? The whole town is quite <br/>
close by.<br/>
<br/>
Re: Your "count" of P4F0. I don't think you have to erase all your <br/>
finds just because the stamp images have moved to Hoboken. I'll check <br/>
my LBNA rulesbook, but I think that once found, never lost is best.<br/>

Jay in expectantly waiting CT.<br/>
