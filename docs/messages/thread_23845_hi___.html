I think that everyone realized that you were upset. It was the Yelling <br/>
that confused me more than anything. I know it is disapointing but to <br/>
yell at us all was a big "huh"?<br/>
<br/>
Part of the fun is the big search.The having to sit down and think <br/>
were you off a few steps or in the wrong direction.I have not found a <br/>
box and returned on a differant day and found it.<br/>

Hi<br/>
There are a few things out in the computer world as far as <br/>
ettiquette for the boards.You can search on yahoo and they will give <br/>
you the heads up. Writing in all caps is yelling. A couple of words <br/>
is expressing your fact but to have paragraphs in caps is just <br/>
freaking out/going off on people. Thats why we were all like What? <br/>
<br/>
We are all also all over the country so your single post is getting <br/>
read in differant time zones and just goes on and on...<br/>
<br/>
Good ways to express your self are with emicons or just using <br/>
happy :-) or sad :-) or mad &gt;:-( faces.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

OK, can you please just drop it?  Seriously.  I never get involved in the <br/>
flame wars on here, but you need to let this go.<br/>
<br/>
You posted something that was considered inflamatory by many, then took <br/>
offense when people responded defensively.  I see that you tried to explain <br/>
yourself by saying that you were having a bad day. We can see that.  You don't need <br/>
to post it again.<br/>
<br/>
Now it's time to move on, shall we?  You have said yourself that there are <br/>
bigger things in life than this to deal with.  And you're absolutely right.  So <br/>
let's all just move on.<br/>
