Finally took the my kids and the 3 neighbor girls out and FOUND your <br/>
Jefferson Barracks Box.  We thought the stamp was well chosen for the spot!<br/>
Of course there was too much walking involved as far as one or tow of them <br/>
was concerned!   :o)<br/>
<br/>
We did make the mistake of following the Grant Street in the National Cem. <br/>
first ... which also had a very scenic Circle Drive, a maintenance garage, a <br/>
pine tree lane, a view of the Mississippi  &amp; a rock wall!   The clues just <br/>
didn't fit in the right place.  We almost gave up, thinking (of course) the <br/>
problem was with the clue writer not the clue readers.  <br/>
<br/>
But alas, one more try - we head north think the park (duh) might have a <br/>
Grant Street also.  We pulled in at the Cannon Gate with the rifle barrel <br/>
fence to let the kids play and almost quit for the day when I noticed the <br/>
street signs...we were in the right place!  I scared my kids when I stopped <br/>
the van.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
We thought we would be the first there but NANCY DREW had stamped in as had a <br/>
Letterboxing family just a few days later!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the fun.  :o)<br/>
