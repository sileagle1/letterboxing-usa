six letterboxes.  None of the boxes that I have found have been <br/>

    When I put together the last few of my letterboxes, I DID mount <br/>

no idea ever happened.  It was also mentioned that mounting them <br/>
helps "little fingers" stamp them.  So, I thought I would try it.<br/>
<br/>
    I used an eighth inch piece of wood (walnut), sanded.  I coated <br/>
the stamp with silicone adhesive sealant and then pressed it on the <br/>

    I realize that there are benefits to doing this either way, with <br/>
or without a mount.  But, I wanted to know if there are more "horror <br/>

broken, or just occasionally are.  Does wood mounting warp when wet?  <br/>
Is there a huge difference in ability to get a clear stamped image <br/>

<br/>
It's just an option and not 'better' or 'worse', per se.  Some boxes <br/>
may not work well for mounting stamp such as microboxes where stamps <br/>
with mounts may not fit at all.  Very large stamps sometimes don't <br/>
work well with mounts either, because it can be difficult to get the <br/>
middle of the stamp to transfer well.  (The force of pressing down on <br/>
the stamp ends up near the edges of the stamp, rather than the center <br/>
of the stamp.)  And for some types of the MasterCarve, the stuff is <br/>
so thick, a mount is largely unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
The only two reasons I can think of to mount a stamp are:<br/>
<br/>
1. It's usually less messy for people to stamp in<br/>
<br/>
2. It makes the stamp look more professional<br/>
<br/>
Unless you're shooting for one of those goals, there's not much <br/>
reason to mount your stamp.<br/>

I was never sure exactly what kind of glue to use, I used silicone but<br/>
I suspect that over the long haul silicone will work loose.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Funny... I haven't found that many boxes, but so far every one has been mounted on wood-- at least 1/4" thick or more.  Even here in PA where it's damp, I would think the warping wouldn't be such an issue if you use thick enough wood and the stamp is not too huge.  I don't think it would be much use mounting on anything less than 1/4" thick.  Seems too me the unmounted ones would be pretty messy, but as I said I haven't seen any.  Some that were mounted on an organic shaped piece of wood rather than a square one were very nice to get a good grip on when stamping.  The images don't seem to remain on the wood for very long, though.  Maybe when you do that image, it should be stamped into something other than the ink we all use to stamp on paper.  To solve the problem of the edges getting more pressure when stamping, I've seen a couple with knobs, like the wooden knobs sold for drawer-pulls at hardware stores.  They worked great.  --lunaryakketyact<br/>

I'm one of the ones out for the professional look Ryan mentioned. My <br/>
favorite part of making stamps is putting coat after coat of shiny <br/>
spray glaze on the back of the wood mounting, over the image. If I <br/>
can't mount it, I can't spray it, and then it's no fun.<br/>
Exceptions to this have been where the stamps in a series were <br/>
pieces of a map, and their labels. I couldn't imagine anyone peeking <br/>
under the wood to line up the edges, so I left them unmounted and <br/>
drew the outlines on top to help them along.<br/>
But now that that's over, my spray can and I am ready for the next <br/>
adventure...<br/>
