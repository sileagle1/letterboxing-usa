                    <html><body>About a year ago, there was a beautiful trumpeter swan that lived on Lake Elkhorn in Columbia, MD.  Her name was Patty.  She was named after Patty Rouse, the wife of James Rouse - founder of Columbia.  Patty was killed one day by a teenager with a pellet gun.  In her memory, I have placed The Patty Letterbox at Lake Elkhorn.<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
Patty letterbox<br/>
Location:  Lake Elkhorn, Columbia, MD<br/>
Difficulty:  easy<br/>
Placed:  August 5, 2002<br/>
Distance:  There is a two-mile paved circuit trail around Lake Elkhorn.  Box is placed less than half way around.<br/>
<br/>
Lake Elkhorn can be reached from Broken Land Parkway in Columbia, near Snowden River Parkway.  Park in the lot off of Broken Land.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the trail up to the lake, staying to the right at the two forks in the trail before you get to the lake.  You will pass the Nature Camp Pavilion on the right.  Keeping the lake on your left follow the trail.  You will be walking through a fitness trail.<br/>
<br/>
Accross from Log Hop you will see a large rock on the right side of the trail.  Approximately 42 steps from that rock there is a large light grey smooth barked tree on the right.  (Someday I'll learn tree identification!)  Behind that tree is a fallen tree.  At the top of the fallen tree, it splits into two seperate branches.  Patty is hiding at the fork of these two branches.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of traffic on this trail.  I scared the heck out of a jogger as I came out of the woods!<br/>
<br/>
After you find Patty, I hope you will continue along the path around the lake.  There are tons of ducks and geese that hang out on the opposite side of the lake.  I also saw a lone swan and a blue heron today.  There are also plenty of fish and turtles to see swimming in the lake.<br/>
