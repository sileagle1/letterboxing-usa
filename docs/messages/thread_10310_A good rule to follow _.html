<div>I have always felt the best way to respond to 
the "Talk List" is either not respond or to respond in such a manner that you 
would in person. That the person you are responding to is within arms length, 
and that person is Iron Mike Tyson, and he has had a very bad day,a couple of 
beers and generally ready to rip your head off and stuff it in a very small 
aperture. That usually tempers my thoughts. Don <span id="__#Ath#SignaturePos__"></span> </div></body></html>
