Rustypuff, thank you for bringing this to our attention, I can assure <br/>
you the moderators will keep an eye out on the thread as I agree with <br/>
you that the "database" issue has been rehashed too many times and it <br/>
will not be rehashed again.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me take the time to remind all the LBNA list members that <br/>
Randy himself declared this issue a "Dead Horse" and revisiting this <br/>
issue and stirring up yet another heated debate on a topic that too <br/>
many can not agree on is liable to get your subscription to this <br/>
group revisited by the moderators.<br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well and a happy holidays,<br/>

It does seem odd that as a letterboxing group, we would be forbidden to <br/>
discuss issues that so deeply divide us. Yet history has shown that we are <br/>
unable to resolve these fundamental differences through rational discourse <br/>
and respectful compromise. Why is this? One reason that leaps to mind is that <br/>
we have no formal governing body, nor any rules for resolving disagreements <br/>
in the letterboxing world. Thus disagreements are not resolved to anyone's <br/>
satisfaction, tempers flare, and those in charge of the various venues in the <br/>
letterboxing world are forced to perform judicial duties ad hoc.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we need some sort of Letterboxing Loya Jurga??<br/>
<br/>
Something to chew on?<br/>

What's that?  Surely you couldn't be using that perjoratively redefined, <br/>
offensive, ignorant, bigoted term for minority religions that aren't your own?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I don't think so<br/>
&gt; snip snip snip<br/>
&gt; off the list<br/>
<br/>
Good riddance.  Let's stop flapping and ragging on each other about nothing <br/>
and get back to 'boxing, which is fun, creative, wholesome, good exercise, <br/>
should involve well-intended good fellowship and the reason that we are all here <br/>
on this list in the first place. <br/>

And the Loya Jirga is an Afghani tribal council, a secular rather than <br/>
sectarian body.<br/>
