                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, Martha by Mail #3 has arrived at my house. She surprised me by<br/>
arriving before my 'company is coming' cleaning was done.  I must say<br/>
(having heard certain rumors) I was amazed at her graciousness when<br/>
she offered to go do some shopping, giving me time finish up.  She<br/>
returned ecstatic over a great deal she got on a one-of-a-kind<br/>
handmade quilt.  The pattern, stitching and detail exquisite, and I<br/>
must say the quilt was beautifully made.  She spread it out on the<br/>
guest bed and while we were ooohing and aaahing over it, the dog<br/>
trotted in and before I could do anything, jumped up on the quilt . .<br/>
. . .  what is it about a brand new white quilt that makes a dog<br/>
nauseous?  I don't have to tell you that the poop really hit the fan.<br/>
 No matter what I said, despite my grovelling and offers to repay her<br/>
and clean the quilt, she refused to be soothed and insisted on<br/>
leaving.  So she packed up and I drove her to the Post Office where<br/>
she picked up her first class ticket and left. <br/>
