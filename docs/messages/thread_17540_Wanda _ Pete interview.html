interests yet, there are a few of you out there that make me wonder if I belong. What <br/>
would make a person want to hike thousands of miles? Making a goal of 2000 Fs <br/>
in a year, who would accomplish something like that? Believe me, I'm nothing <br/>
like these people!! But behind these passions are 2 gentle, and quietly <br/>
enthusiastic individuals that make me grateful I'm involved in the same pastime.<br/>
<br/>
The Wanda and Pete interview was as interesting as any I've read, maybe more <br/>
so since I've been intrigued by their adventures, both together and apart, for <br/>
a long time now. I remember visiting Rhode Island and finding a box with a <br/>
WandaandPete stamp. WOW, THAT was a score!! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great effort, Pepe. Like Pete said, gatherings are all about <br/>
meeting fellow letterboxers. Short of traveling a couple thousand miles for a <br/>
face-to-face, we feel we've met Wanda and Pete in this interview, <br/>

*hehe*  I'd be more surprised if you can find a letterbox in Rhode <br/>
Island that the Wanda &amp; Pete team haven't stamped into!  Now THAT <br/>
would be a score!!! =)<br/>

True: but we were rank newbies at the time (I think that box numbered in the <br/>
20s of our F list) and even THEN, we knew of Wanda and Pete. <br/>
