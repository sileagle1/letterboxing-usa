In looking for a different handle for my speedball carving set as the <br/>
red handle with the rough metal ring that you turn to hold the blade <br/>
in place wears blisters on my fingers I ran into these new carving <br/>
tools by Mastercarve.<br/>
<br/>
I purchased some myself on eBay  there is another set on there as <br/>
well. Though since only one person can get that set I did some <br/>
research on the net to see where you could buy them normally<br/>
<br/>
The ebay link is:<br/>
http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?<br/>
ViewItem&amp;item=2356487578&amp;category=3128<br/>
<br/>
To purchase them normally you can check out:<br/>
http://www.misterart.com/store/view.cfm?group_id=7883&amp;store=001<br/>
<br/>
Also another little tip  Iron`Bear happen to have a nib handle for a <br/>
calligraphy set in his art supplies and we tried it out and the <br/>
speedball blades fit in it great.  I love it, it gives me a better <br/>
grip on the tool and a little more play for carving fine lines.  I <br/>
personally was never fond of the speedball handle.  You can find <br/>
these nib handles at any art supply store in the calligraphy section <br/>
relatively inexpensive.  I also tried using a calligraphy nib as a <br/>
carving blade as the ends are very small, it took a little getting <br/>
used to but it worked great for small detail I'm on a carving frenzy <br/>
now! <br/>
<br/>
I personally think these new Mastercarve carving tools are going to <br/>
be great as the little rubber grippers are going to be very <br/>
comfortable I am betting.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Carving<br/>

I only use the #1 blade though and wouldn't want to pay for the <br/>
others that would just sit around. I'll have to do some searching and <br/>
see if I can find them sold seprately. Thanks for sharing!<br/>
