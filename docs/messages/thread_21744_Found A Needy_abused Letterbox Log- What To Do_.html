Hi,<br/>
Strangely enough, I just found out about geocaching/letterboxing<br/>
yesterday. My brother and I thought it was enormously cool, and<br/>
sparked our interest in hiking- we spent hours looking up various<br/>
sites about it. Fueled by our new discovery, I asked him if he wanted<br/>
to go to Purgatory Chasm this afternoon, which e of course did. While<br/>
we were there, we found a sprial bound notebook in a very obvious<br/>
location, leaning up against a tree in the open about 20 feet from the<br/>
edge of lover's leap. The first page was torn off and found a few feet<br/>
away. I recognized it as a letterbox, which I explained to my brother.<br/>
As we flipped through the pages, the years progressed steadily until<br/>
last november when it stopped abruptly, then there were a dozen<br/>
entries in it today, some in children's handwriting. I didn't think<br/>
it'd last another day out there, with the obnoxious kids smoking and<br/>
throwing rocks just 50 feet away- not exactly the kind of company you<br/>
want finding a needy letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
After discussing it with my brother, we decided to take it home and<br/>
try and find the owner. I hope we did thsi right thing with that.<br/>
Please find attached three pictures of it.<br/>

My sons and I found a similar situation yesterday at the Diamond Hill<br/>
Letterbox in Cumberland RI. All we found was a ziplock bag  with a<br/>
single sheet of paper in it. The note explained that another boxer had<br/>
found the original destroyed by fire in December 2004. The area showed<br/>
burn damage consistent with a brush fire, likely started by careless<br/>
kids partying. The single sheet was intended to serve as an interim<br/>
log.  I added a couple more sheets and donated a spare container I had<br/>
with me . The stamp is gone though. Also the bag contained an old<br/>
spring and a dime so it appears that a geocache has at some point<br/>
taken up residence in the letterbox so I wonder if the stamp was taken<br/>
by a geocacher as a trinket.<br/>
<br/>
anyway I too would be interested. Do we just call this box dead or do<br/>
we continue to try to keep it going, carve a new stamp or whatnot?<br/>
<br/>
What's the protocol<br/>

if you can give me a zip code or accurate address, I can search the <br/>
geocaching site as to whether someone traded for stamp.  But it <br/>
looks like a new stamps will need to be created.<br/>

Purgatory Chasm Boxes - The Proposal<br/>
<br/>
These boxes were originally planted by Jeremy Disch and Family <br/>
waaaaaaay back when.  Last December, after careful consideration, <br/>
they decided to retire their boxes.  Most, if not all of the boxes <br/>
they had, they pulled right out the locations.<br/>
<br/>
I had "adopted" one of their boxes - Bonsai - two or three years <br/>
ago.  I had given it routine maintenance and it had quite a few <br/>
visitors.  Then, one day, doing box maintenance, I discovered that <br/>
the box was gone.  A quick check to the database, plus a few emails <br/>
exchanged, confirmed that they had withdrawn from letterboxing and <br/>
they pulled their boxes and clues.<br/>
<br/>
Purgatory Chasm is a GREAT place for letterboxes.  Since there are <br/>
now officially NO letterboxes there, I'd suggest that if you like the <br/>
place, plant a box or two (or three or ...) of your own!<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox seekers will love you for it !!!<br/>

I agree.  I have seen so many folks plant boxes and then are unable to <br/>
pursue the hobby.  So many little orphans out there ....<br/>
<br/>
If EVERYTHING is gone, and it is quite possibly the home of a geocache <br/>
now, I would suggest creating a new box of your own and planting it in <br/>
a slightly different place in the same general area.<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox seekers everywhere will rejoice !!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Give or take a couple yards ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Close enough?<br/>
&gt; thank god for mapping gps'rs:), those coordinates put me in Rhode <br/>
&gt; Island, nw of Harrisville, ne of wilson resevoir. let's play warm &amp; <br/>
&gt; cold.  what direction do i need to head? and how far?<br/>
<br/>
OK well those are from terraserver.com. Wilson Resevoir and<br/>
Harrisville are both considerably too far west. <br/>
<br/>
Search cumberland, Rhode Island. On Rt. 114/Diamond Hill Rd. in<br/>
"Diamond Hill state park". Due east of the northern half of the<br/>
Diamond Hill Resevoir.Closer to the NE corner of RI.<br/>

Geocaching.com.... who knew? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Looks like the geocach is an ammo box, close to but not in the same<br/>
place at the cairn the LB is in, so I'm very confused about the dime<br/>
and the spring in the LB...<br/>
