<br/>
It has recently come to my attention that any personal emails sent to me <br/>
with LBNA or LBNE in the subject line go directly into my letterboxing <br/>
folders. I'm embarassed to admit I don't read every post, depending on how <br/>
crazy my week is.<br/>
<br/>
I happened to have found an email to me in the wrong folder and I am <br/>
concerned others have emailed me and I have not seen your reply....Mostly <br/>
because I have written to a few of you and never heard anything back.(trying <br/>
not to feel rejected)<br/>
<br/>
In any case if you have emailed me and have not heard back from me I <br/>
applogize. If you send me a personal email please remove LBNA/LBNE from the <br/>
subject line or I may not get it.<br/>
<br/>
PS Brian and Lori, congratulations on the new addition to the letterboxing <br/>
community!!<br/>
