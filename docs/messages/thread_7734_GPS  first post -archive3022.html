&gt; Interesting reading the thoughts back in May 2000 [...] Two years <br/>
&gt; later nothing new. Clues Clues Clues. <br/>
<br/>
I guess my thoughts on this matter in the archives were missed, so <br/>
what the heck :-).  As a clue writer who has done new stuff over the<br/>
past two years, more words on this topic that never seems to die, for <br/>
the archives ...<br/>
<br/>
If you like gps clues, write them, or find only boxes that are<br/>
gps-based.  IMHO, there have been alot of new innovations in clues <br/>
in the past two years.  GPS clues are perfectly acceptable, to <br/>
say "It would be nice if coordinates were an accepted part of this <br/>
hobby" doesn't make sense.  All clues are accepted to the list.<br/>
No clue is accepted by everyone.  Write clues to your audience,<br/>
whether its 5% or 95% of the people.<br/>
<br/>
In the early days, some clues were based on gps, even before SA was<br/>
turned off and geocaching existed.  It could have evolved that way, <br/>
but it didn't, prolly because people didn't want it to, based on <br/>
taste.  My sense is that most people ignored gps clues, just as <br/>
most people ignore mine.  That's the way is should work.  When <br/>
Dave Ulmer "invented" geocaching, those who were into gps went <br/>
that way, and those that were not went this way.<br/>
<br/>
To say using a gps makes clues "exclusive" doesn't make sense either,<br/>
at least to me.  I have a friend who does geocaching who doesn't own<br/>
a gps.  I don't think he feels geocaching is exclusive because he <br/>
doesn't own a gps, and the clues use coordinates.  I guess my clues<br/>
are exclusive as well, as you have to use all sorts of tools to find<br/>
them.  I'm not sure why people think there is something special or<br/>
magical about the gps tool.  Finally, if you need or want gps <br/>
coordinates to the starting point of my clues, then my clues are not<br/>
for you anyway.  And what is wrong with being "exclusive", that is<br/>
to say, requiring a particular skill to find a box?  All boxes are<br/>
exclusive in one way or another (time, actually, usually being the<br/>
resource most excluded on ...).<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I've been told by my geocaching friend that one of the<br/>
geocaching web sites has a "committee" that approves clues (I don't<br/>
know, his words).  To require gps coords on clues would necessitate <br/>
some sort of analogous committee to make sure the clues had these <br/>
coordinates (all requirements need enforcement, or they become <br/>
meaningless).  My sense is that people historically haven't wanted <br/>
something like this, and since this list is not moderated, your gps<br/>
clues can come onto the list if you want to write them.  As for the<br/>
lbna website (or your own website), my guess is that a similar <br/>
attitude holds sway.  If pro or anti gps people are saying they want<br/>
the hobby to be gps friendly, or gps anti-friendly, participate in<br/>
the way you see fit, and see how it evolves ...<br/>
<br/>
So, no one is stopping you from doing gps clues, but I think most<br/>
people don't care for them.  But do what you want to do, just don't<br/>
ask me to do what you want me to do, or ignore me when I don't :-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

Oh well, I guess Randy's right, you can write your clues (or non-clues if<br/>
you prefer) any way you want.  Maybe I'll plant a box using Loran-C, which<br/>
is still the standard for the local lobster fleet.  I just won't spend much<br/>
time carving the stamp, as I wouldn't expect anyone to visit.<br/>

type in the town or park or mountain or whatever and it'll point you <br/>
to the map you need.<br/>

Back in the day I was lobstering out of Newport RI and we used Loran, <br/>

some fun fishing!<br/>
