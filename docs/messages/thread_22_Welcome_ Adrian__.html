Yes, your replies are coming through fine.  On behalf of all the pioneers of<br/>
American Letterboxing, I would like to welcome you to the "Letterbox USA" talk<br/>
list.  I think you will enjoy the spirit of camaraderie this group is<br/>
developing.  <br/>
<br/>
Rather than being the product of one person's capitalistic desires, this<br/>
entire project has become a group effort.  Letterbox enthusiasts from across<br/>
the country have been working in unison to produce our web site, maps, and<br/>
email services.  Rather than try to monopolize clues, we are striving to<br/>
achieve open communications, FREE quality services, and, above all, RESPECT...<br/>
for both the needs of our fellow hobbyists and for the traditional "spirit" of<br/>
Letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Your continued assistance is greatly needed.  Many of us know of Letterboxing<br/>
only through the Smithsonian article that you contributed to.  Although<br/>
American Letterboxing will never be the same as it is in Dartmoor, I think it<br/>
will prove to be a long-lasting, intriguing, and charming pastime for a<br/>
country that very much NEEDS to get in touch with both Old World tradition and<br/>
New World adventure.<br/>
<br/>
I invite you to join in our conversations, listen patiently to our feeble<br/>
attempts to recreate this magical hobby, and then smile confidently as you<br/>
share your knowledge and understanding with us.  Not only do we want to do<br/>
this, we want to do it RIGHT.  With your guidance, I know we will.<br/>
<br/>
a "Letterbox USA" patriot,<br/>
Mitch Klink (a.k.a. "Der Mad Stamper")<br/>
