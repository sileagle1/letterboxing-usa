  So...  as for the bad directions, I found a box yesterday.  The clues did <br/>
  contain a bad direction.  They were good for the most part, but where the clue <br/>
  indicated that I should go southeast, I actually needed to go northeast.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Re the northeast/southeast....I would contact the placer.  Im sure they would be happy to hear from you and will change the clues accordingly.  I assume that is why some people have friends follow their clues after placing a box...to correct any errors....<br/>
