                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome to letterboxing! I wouldn't call myself and expert but I can<br/>
tell you what how I do things.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man, I bought one of those<br/>
backpacks that convert to a campstool. It holds all the things I need<br/>
(including box maintance/repair items) and I always have a place to<br/>
sit down and stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
I learned the hard way that my logbook should have some properties<br/>
that the first one I made, did not have. <br/>
<br/>
First, I like my logbook to open flat so when I make my logbooks now,<br/>
they always have a coil binding. <br/>
<br/>
Second, there are very few smooth hard surfaces to stamp on in the<br/>
woods (duh!) so the pretty soft-cover log I made the first time was<br/>
beautiful -- but nearly useless. Now, the covers on my logbook are<br/>
always made from Matteboard the pages are blank 4x6 index cards. I got<br/>
my matteboard from the scrap box at Michaels in the picture framing<br/>
department. <br/>
<br/>
I frequently box with a very good friend who uses a fanny-pack to<br/>
carry all her stuff. My daughter has recently been using a messenger<br/>
bag that she tucks an old vinyl tablecloth into for sitting on. (She<br/>
thanks Grandvilla and Mobiusklein, for that idea)<br/>
<br/>
Like you, I also wear my compass around my neck. When I find the box,<br/>
I take myself a ways from the hiding spot, then from the front pocket<br/>
of the pack, I take out my little pack. The little pack contains my<br/>
logbook, 5 basic color markers, six mini stamp pads (I modified them<br/>
so the lids stay attached) plus several of those alcohol prep pads<br/>
(good for cleaning off fingers)and a quart size ziplock bag for trash.<br/>
<br/>
Once I have my little pack out, I convert my backpack to a stool and<br/>
sit down. The open box can lay at my feet (or with one foot on it, if<br/>
it's windy) while I take out the parts I need to work with. Sitting on<br/>
my camp-stool, I'm comfy and can take time to enjoy reading the<br/>
logbook, stamping in and writing a note. <br/>
<br/>
If the box needs maintance, I can always unzip the large compartment<br/>
and get out the supplies I keep in there. If it's drizzling, snowing,<br/>
sleeting, raining, ect. I have one of those flat-fold umbrellas in my<br/>
pack that I can prop over my shoulder while I work.<br/>
<br/>
Due to some physical limitations, I'm not able to take long hikes any<br/>
more so I don't have to carry quite as many "what if -- just in case"<br/>
items, like we used to. Nowdays, the snacks I carry aren't packed with<br/>
an eye to an emergency overnight stay in the woods... they're usually<br/>
eaten by kiddo's as rewards for sticking with us while we go for "just<br/>
one more box" LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm also not an old-timer, but have been doing it long enough to have a <br/>
system that works for me.<br/>
<br/>
For carrying things, I just use a plain old backpack, like you'd buy a <br/>
kid for school - one large pocket, one zipper pocket on the outside. <br/>
It's handy for carrying all that I need and keeping it out of the way <br/>
while I'm walking/searching. I have a large Ziploc that holds my <br/>
logbook, ink pad, stamps, pen - the ink pad and stamps are in their own <br/>
smaller baggie inside the larger one - and just pull the whole packet <br/>
out when it's time to stamp in. When I get to wherever I'll be <br/>
stamping, I use the baggies and the box and the box lid to hold the <br/>
various bits without dumping them into the dirt. I tend not to box in <br/>
the rain, but have boxed in the snow and found that this worked well. <br/>
The rain would complicate things with the need to keep everything <br/>
dry.......<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the backpack is large enough to carry everything from compass <br/>
to cellphone to snacks to whatever else I feel I need that day. The one <br/>
thing I will probably add next season is some sort of sitting surface - <br/>
I don't think I can carry a stadium seat, but maybe a bit of plastic <br/>
just large enough to keep the old tush from getting damp will be <br/>
enough. :-) I do like that my logbook has hard covers - makes stamping <br/>
a lot easier, both into my book and into the box' book since I have a <br/>
hard surface handy to place it on if it is soft-cover......<br/>
<br/>
My learning curve this year included the fact that I should wrap my <br/>
stamps up instead of just putting them into the baggie with the ink <br/>
pads. They were fine for a really long time, but ultimately, the ink <br/>
pads bumped against them enough that some edge detail was chipped off <br/>
and now I need to recarve. That solution is probably as simple as <br/>
wrapping each stamp in a bit of felt, though.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I started with a large mesh backpack two years ago and stuffed it with way<br/>
too much stuff, including a very large logbook (bought before I started). <br/>
I was always too hot with this on my back.  For the past year I take the<br/>
minimum; my silent boxing partner will only carry the clues, his water,<br/>
and nothing more!<br/>
<br/>
I bought a small lumbar pack (swissgear) that holds two water bottles. <br/>
The small outside zipper pocket holds my compass, extra pen, state park<br/>
pass, pocket knife and comb (never used).  Inside the large pouch I have<br/>
two mesh pockets where I hold my 2 PTs and ink pads, extra baggies.  the<br/>
rest of the pack is for my stamp and ink pens (I recycled a mesh bag from<br/>
kitchen spoons purchased and added a shoe lace to close it up), a small<br/>
spiral logbook, extra supplies and my snacks.  I use a plastic bar soap<br/>
container and fold up a wet sponge cloth for cleaning stamps.  This stuff<br/>
does fit, but sometimes I have to really pull it all out to find what I<br/>
need.  It is compact and wearing this pack does not slow me down.  I might<br/>
have to go back to something larger for winter to include space for<br/>
discarded clothing layers and floor tarp, but the heat factor won't be an<br/>
issue.<br/>
<br/>
Our longest, single hike away from the car was about 4.5 hours.  We eat a<br/>
hearty breakfast and my snack choice has worked well ... I love Ocean<br/>
Spray's resealable bag of Cranberries, almonds, peanuts and chocolate<br/>
chips.<br/>
<br/>
My collapsable hiking pole has a carabiner and a whistle attached.  And<br/>
the silent one sometimes carries a cell phone.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this gives you some ideas,<br/>

It holds our stamps, log books, containers, band-aids, and pretty much<br/>
anything else we think of and it opens up into a seat.  This makes<br/>
stamping in so much easier.  We can also pretend we are sketching or<br/>
having a snack if people come by and hide stuff quickly so we aren't<br/>
caught standing around with the contents of the boxes everywhere and<br/>
stamps in hand.  Sometimes for quicker stops, we just use it like a<br/>
little table and it gives us a place to set everything.<br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a small "tackle" type box that I use to keep my letterboxing <br/>
supplies in. The dividers are removeable, so I can customize the <br/>
compartments for my stamp, pens, and stamp pads, replacement ziplock <br/>
bags, diaper wipes (to clean hands, not stamps), tissues, etc...(Yes, <br/>
I'm anal!) I keep my log book in the bottom part of the box. <br/>
<br/>
Then I put that inside a backpack. I use the kind that is really for <br/>
computer equipment. It's padded and really cofortable. There are also <br/>
lots of little pockets for snacks, water, disposable rain poncho, <br/>
sunscreen, first-aid kit. (I try to use the trial sizes of most <br/>
things to cut down on the size.) <br/>
<br/>
I keep my compass and a really loud whistle (for emergencies) on a <br/>
string and loop it around the top part of one shoulder strap. (I've <br/>
found this is the best place for me to keep the compass. If I hold it <br/>
in my hand, my hands aren't free to hold clues or poke around inside <br/>
things. If I carry it in my backpack, then I have to stop and dig it <br/>
out when I need it. If I wear it around my neck, I will eventually <br/>
take it off and put it down somewhere and forget to get it for my <br/>
next excursion. If I keep it on the shoulder strap of my backpack, I <br/>
can reach it easily to check my directions, and it's ALWAYS there. I <br/>
also keep the whistle there because I letterbox alone sometimes and <br/>
if I fall I can easily get to the whistle to call for help. The <br/>
whistle I have takes little effort to blow loudly and can be heard <br/>
easier than a human's voice.)<br/>
<br/>
If it is a long letterboxing vacation, I put all the clues in a 3 <br/>
ring notebook, divided up by state, or city. I try to get as much <br/>
information about the location as possible. I almost always google <br/>
the park name to see if I can get a park map and an address, then I <br/>
can mapquest the address to get a better idea of where I'm going. I <br/>
print off anything I find that is helpful and put it behind the clues <br/>
in the notebook. I take along a plastic sheet protector to put the <br/>
clues in while I'm out on the trail. This way if it starts to <br/>
drizzle, the clues don't get too wet.) I also have a little plastic <br/>
pencil pouch in the notebook to keep park fees/passes in. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, if I'm just going after a few local boxes, I just print <br/>
the clues and run out the door, leaving behind the notebook.<br/>
<br/>
Ok...I think that was more than 2 cents, but I hope it gave somebody <br/>
so ideas.<br/>
<br/>
If not, the only thing left to mention is the kitchen sink...<br/>

and Bruce carries the "repair kit" which is an extra of everything <br/>
plus a bunch of ziplock bags.  We use hydration packs from EMS -- the <br/>
kind with a water bag &amp; drinking tube built in.<br/>
<br/>
When we bring my daughter's dog, Cleo, she carries the trash we pick <br/>
up in her pack. She also carries a small shovel, trashbags, and a <br/>
tennis ball. She drinks when I squirt water from my pack, so we don't <br/>
need to carry extra water and its not a major production to get drinks.<br/>
<br/>
Just remember: a heavy pack will make you stronger! Just make sure it <br/>
fits right.<br/>

I've been using a largish fanny-pack, but recently upgraded to a <br/>
CamelBack pack with the water-thingy for longer hikes. I downgrade <br/>
back to the fanny-pack, or even jacket pockets, for drive-by boxes, <br/>
and am thinking of something like a courier bag for urban ones to <br/>
blend into the crowd better. I keep a box of supplies in the back of <br/>
the car and pack up as needed for any given box.<br/>
