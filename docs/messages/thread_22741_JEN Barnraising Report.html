                    <div class="plaintext-content">Fresh in from Bardwell Lake.  Nice little park -<br/>
nothing like a state park, but quiet and secluded,<br/>
and apparently the staff there considers it to be a<br/>
pretty exclusive resort-type place - you gotta really<br/>
want to get in to get in...more on that later!<br/>
<br/>
My family rolled in to Bardwell at 8:30 or so Friday<br/>
evening, got set up, sat around and watched a<br/>
phenomenally beautiful sunset, and I finally retired<br/>
with a good book.  LSS retired well after midnight. <br/>
I arose bright and early (7 a.m.) and stumbled out of<br/>
the tent to put in my contacts, only to find a<br/>
mysterious envelope on our picnic table!  Hadn't<br/>
found my contacts yet, so I had to work to read<br/>
"Please<br/>
don't open before 3:30!".  Well fine.  I woke LSS up<br/>
to see if he knew how it had gotten there, but he<br/>
just groaned and went back to sleep.  My son helpfully<br/>
suggested maybe it meant 3:30 a.m. and we pondered<br/>
that for a moment, until I heard a voice from the<br/>
tent say "You DO know what Trustworthy means, don't<br/>
you?"<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if it was LSS or my conscience, but<br/>
since my son heard it too, I'm thinking it was<br/>
probably<br/>
not my conscience.  Blasted scout law.  <br/>
<br/>
We spent the day getting ready and relaxing and<br/>
finally, went to plant our own box.  When we<br/>
returned, PuddleSplasher and Viewfinder and Catpawz 1<br/>
and 2 were there visiting.  I showed them the envelope<br/>
and we all pondered our watches (well, I didn't have a<br/>
watch so I pondered the meaning of Trustworthy). <br/>
Lightning (my son) and LSS (Fearless Fox) took off for<br/>
a Walmart run<br/>
and Ruby Tuesday and her LSS, Stillwater, showed up<br/>
soon after and Lena arrived right about the same<br/>
time (go Lena!  She didn't want to make the road trip<br/>
solo, but she did!).  Again, I pondered the first<br/>
point of the scout law while they examined the<br/>
envelope. <br/>
<br/>
The Cummins Clan and Delivery Girl rolled in shortly<br/>
thereafter and everyone watches showed 3:30, but<br/>
Lightning wasn't back yet and he had been so patient<br/>
with me all day that we had to wait for him. <br/>
Fortunately we didn't have to wait too long before<br/>
Lightning and FF arrived and we opened the envelope.<br/>
<br/>
The food was really good and everyone brought<br/>
something wonderful!  It was fun getting to know<br/>
everyone and - what?  You want to know what was in<br/>
the envelope?  <br/>
<br/>
The envelope had a very nice letter from our<br/>
esteemed Gryzzled Gryphon, letting us know that he was<br/>
gracing us with the clues to his very first plant! <br/>
Woo Hoo!  He also mentioned that if we needed a<br/>
further clue, we should open a second sealed envelope<br/>
enclosed in the bigger one.  I pulled out the clues -<br/>
and we discovered that they looked just like his<br/>
signature!<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who have seen his stamp, you know<br/>
what that means - symbolic code - and we were still<br/>
worlds away from finding the box!  I was confident<br/>
though, and felt certain that the great letterboxing<br/>
minds in attendance would be able to figure it out. <br/>
And it really was kind of scary to watch these minds<br/>
in<br/>
motion - we Texas letterboxers are a formidable<br/>
force!  After all that thinking, we did have to take a<br/>
break to eat, but it wasn't long before we were back<br/>
to<br/>
the clues.  Catpawz#1 was going to town and she was<br/>
fairly certain she had figured out several words. <br/>
Turns out she was right on one particular word, but<br/>
for thewrong reason.  Huh?  you say?  We did too! <br/>
Just as one of us thought we had it going, Stillwater<br/>
would pipe in with his unerring logic and ask a<br/>
question or two about "why" or "why not"?  And we<br/>
would find ourselves redirected yet again.  I'm<br/>
thinking he would've enjoyed studying under Socrates,<br/>
but that's another story.  We were all so focused on<br/>
solving the clues that I don't think a single person<br/>
seriously considered asking for the sealed clue.  In<br/>
fact, at one point we discussed when and how to open<br/>
it, and we all agreed we didn't want extra help.  We<br/>
also agreed that the first person to solve the clue<br/>
and find the box would receive the extra clue to open<br/>
to determine the value of it to everyone else.  In<br/>
retrospect, that decision was a critical error on our<br/>
parts.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, at about 6:00 p.m. everyone realized they<br/>
had better head out and find the boxes in the park<br/>
before it got dark.  So off everyone went!  Lena had<br/>
been down earlier in the week and planted boxes and my<br/>
crew and I had gone out and planted one, so there were<br/>
four boxes in the part with the distinct possibility<br/>
of a fifth - if we could ever figure out GG's clues! <br/>
The highly astute Collins Clan and Delivery Girl (that<br/>
is one high energy bunch - all smiles and energy)<br/>
noticed a cranberry PT Cruiser in the parking lot and<br/>
they approached the driver and found that it was<br/>
indeed<br/>
the esteemed Gryzzled Gryphon!  They got a clue from<br/>
him about the clues.<br/>
<br/>
As things were settling down and we were beginning<br/>
to clean up, a stranger approached our campsite and<br/>
asked us "Why aren't you at the party?"  I asked him<br/>
if he meant the "hunting party"...we invited him into<br/>
our campsite and we had a wonderful visit with<br/>
Gryzzled<br/>
Gryphon.  I invited him to log in to the event book<br/>
and our personal book, but he had to go and get a<br/>
different log book to record the event stamp.  While<br/>
he was gone, my LSS chastised Lightning and me for<br/>
asking so many questions, so we tried to lighten up<br/>
a bit when GG returned, but there was just so much to<br/>
learn!  I finally mentioned that we hadn't opened<br/>
the extra clue because we all agreed we wanted to<br/>
decipher the clues the hard way, but he told me the<br/>
extra clue was no good anymore and invited me to open<br/>
it.  Sure enough, the clue was "to look for the<br/>
cranberry PT Cruiser for a clue".   And that, you see,<br/>
was the tactical error on our parts!  Gryzzled Gryphon<br/>
gave me a clue to solving the box clues and oddly<br/>
enough, the clue involved a specialty of my LSS while<br/>
he was in the Navy, so he set to work figuring it out.<br/>
 He had a couple of memory errors (it's been 20 years<br/>
after all!) which GG corrected for us and we were on<br/>
our way to having it figured out!  Once he was<br/>
satisfied we would have the clue solved before the end<br/>
of the night, he bid farewell.  On the one hand, it<br/>
has<br/>
been a fun and interesting element of letterboxing to<br/>
have a mystery boxer and I'm sad that the mystery is<br/>
now over for me, but on the other hand, the pleasure<br/>
of<br/>
meeting such an interesting fellow who has made my<br/>
letterboxing experience richer far outweighs the<br/>
sadness.<br/>
<br/>
We did indeed have the clues figured out by 8:30<br/>
p.m. or so, so my LSS suggested we find it in the<br/>
morning.  Morning?  Yeah right!  Lightning and I were<br/>
heading for it right then, so LSS headed out with us<br/>
too.  It was a clever location, but unfortunately, we<br/>
attracted attention with our flashlights while we were<br/>
looking, so between it being a little bit of a rugged<br/>
spot and the fact we didn't want to get them more<br/>
interested, we held on to the box until the following<br/>
morning.  <br/>
<br/>
As we were emerging the following morning, who should<br/>
be approaching us but Catpawz - both of 'em!  They had<br/>
figured the clues out and driven all the way back down<br/>
to Bardwell to find it.  They were thoroughly<br/>
disappointed until they learned that we had kept the<br/>
box out until morning.  They knew exactly where it was<br/>
to have been, so we gave it to them to stamp in.  And<br/>
before we could get it back in place, Ruby Tuesday and<br/>
Stillwater drove back up and they had solved the clues<br/>
too!  I'm really sorry, y'all, that we had held on to<br/>
the box...I fully expected to be out so early that no<br/>
one could have gotten back before we replaced it.<br/>
<br/>
So, for the summary of the event:  <br/>
21 attendees<br/>
11 new boxes planted (not counting the four planted in<br/>
Johnson County since discussion of the event began).<br/>
