Gangs and we came home with 6 finds. Looks like I'm on a HH roll. <br/>
Found World Domination HH in Froggy's Pad. Hey Strick how about a <br/>
frog leg and mushroom sandwich? Yummmmm! <br/>
   Turtle and I had too much fun today. We laughed all day. We are <br/>
terrible with directions, but found it funny. We were determined to <br/>
find Froggy's Pad. We stumbled down all the wrong turns.<br/>
   We met a Shar-Pei named Sue on ADG's Mystery box hike. And a butt <br/>
blaster it was. We huffed and puffed our way to the top and I started <br/>
looking for the edelweiss. I sang THE HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SOUND <br/>
OF US GASPING FOR AIR! Thank God we have small mountains! Ah yes, <br/>
about Sue, her parents had taken her up the trail to wear her out. <br/>
Only they looked worn out, Sue was eager for more. Turtle said her <br/>
sides were hurting from laughing so hard. It was a great day!<br/>
