<br/>
Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does.<br/>
You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a <br/>
major nightly news program. (USA)<br/>
<br/>
His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across <br/>
a large brown paper bag that was<br/>
suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back <br/>
of her 15-year-old sons closet.<br/>
Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened <br/>
the bag and found it was full of <br/>
cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds, all neatly <br/>
rubber-banded in labeled piles.<br/>
<br/>
"My first though was that he had robbed a bank." says the 41 year old <br/>
woman, "There was over $71,000 <br/>
in that bag that's more than my husband earns in a year."<br/>
<br/>
The woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where <br/>
he worked to tell him what she had <br/>
discovered. He came home right away and they drove together to the <br/>
boys school and picked him up. <br/>
Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more <br/>
shocking than actually finding it in the <br/>
closet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via email, a type <br/>
of "Report" to E-mail addresses that <br/>
he obtained off the internet.<br/>
Everyday<br/>
<br/>
after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on <br/>
his computer in his bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck. I put my <br/>
name on it like the instructions <br/>
said and I started sending it out", says the clever 15 year old.<br/>
<br/>
The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to <br/>
send one $5 dollar bill to each <br/>
person on the list, then delete the address at the bottom and move <br/>
the others down and finally to add <br/>
your name to the top of the list.<br/>
<br/>
The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand <br/>
dollars in five-dollar bills <br/>
within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top <br/>
of the 5-address list. "I get junk <br/>
E-mail all the time, and really did not think it was going to work" <br/>
the boy continues.<br/>
<br/>
Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail. the Post Office <br/>
Box that his parents had gotten <br/>
him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with <br/>
not magazines but envelopes <br/>
containing $5 bills.<br/>
<br/>
"About a week later I rode (my bike) down to the post office and my <br/>
box had 1 magazine and about 300 <br/>
envelopes stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had <br/>
to go up to the (post office) <br/>
counter/ I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes <br/>
on., "I went up to the counter and <br/>
they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back home and <br/>
empty out my backpack because I <br/>
count not carry it all."<br/>
<br/>
Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-<br/>
mail. "The money just kept coming in and <br/>
I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, barely had time <br/>
for my homework" <br/>
He had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area <br/>
and exchanging the $5 dollar <br/>
bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds.<br/>
<br/>
"I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to <br/>
different banks with like five thousand <br/>
at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank <br/>
counter that my dad had sent me in <br/>
to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. One time the <br/>
lady gave me a really strange <br/>
look and told me that she would not be able to do it for and my dad <br/>
would have to come in and do it, <br/>
but I just rode to the next bank down the street. (laughs)."<br/>
Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid. The <br/>
reporting news team examined and <br/>
investigated the so-called "chain-letter" the boy was sending out and <br/>
found that it was not a <br/>
chain-letter at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to US <br/>
Postal and Lottery Laws, Title <br/>
18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, <br/>
also in the code of federal <br/>
regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product <br/>
or service must be exchanged for <br/>
money received.<br/>
<br/>
Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that <br/>
read, <br/>
"Please send me report number XYZ". This simple note made the letter <br/>
legal because he was exchanging a <br/>
service (A Report on how-to) for a five-dollar fee.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the letter that the 15 year old was sending out by Email, you <br/>
can do the exact same thing he <br/>
was doing, simply by following the instructions in this letter.<br/>

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 <br/>
reports<br/>
<br/>
you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information <br/>
which includes how to send bulk <br/>
e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and <br/>
much more.<br/>
<br/>
The BEST method to get this venture going:<br/>
is BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY to Hundreds of thousands..........<br/>
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =<br/>
<br/>
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, <br/>
and we <br/>
will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.<br/>
<br/>
Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the <br/>
response <br/>
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many <br/>
people<br/>
will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only 5,000 <br/>
each)<br/>
<br/>
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a <br/>
0.2%<br/>
response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people <br/>
responded<br/>
by sending out 5,000 emails each for a total of 50,000. Out of those <br/>
50,000 emails, only 0.2% <br/>
responded with orders. <br/>
<br/>
That's 100 people responded and ordered Report #2. Those 100 people <br/>
mailed out 5,000 emails each for <br/>
the total of 500,000 emails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000<br/>
orders for report #3. Those 1000 people send out 5,000 emails each <br/>
for a <br/>
total 5 million emails. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 for <br/>
Report #4.<br/>
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 50,000 <br/>
emails each<br/>
for a total of 50 million emails! The 0.2% response to that is <br/>
100,000 orders for Report # 5 THAT'S <br/>
100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). <br/>
<br/>
Your total income in this example is:<br/>
1....$50+<br/>
2....$500+<br/>
3....$5,000+<br/>
4....$50,000+<br/>
5....$500,000<br/>
<br/>
Grand Total=$555,550.00<br/>
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL AND PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST<br/>
POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL<br/>
MAKE<br/>
A LOT OF MONEY!<br/>
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =<br/>
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000<br/>
YOU MAILED TO.<br/>
<br/>
Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or <br/>
even one 4th of those people <br/>
mailed 100,000 emails each or more? There are over 150 million people <br/>
on the Internet worldwide and <br/>
counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! ( Bulk <br/>
email is the best way to make <br/>
BIG CASH )<br/>

YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES!<br/>
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success.<br/>
If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 <br/>
weeks, continue sending emails until <br/>
you do. After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that <br/>
you should receive 100 orders or <br/>
more for REPORT #2. ( to make huge CASH, Bulk email is the best way )<br/>
<br/>
If you did not, continue advertising or sending emails until you do. <br/>
Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU CAN <br/>
RELAX, because the system is already <br/>
working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in.<br/>
<br/>
This is important to remember.<br/>
<br/>
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in <br/>
front of a Different report. You can <br/>
KEEP TRACK of your Progress by watching which report people are <br/>
ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO <br/>
GENERATE MORE INCOME<br/>
<br/>
SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.<br/>

============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================<br/>
"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an <br/>
accountant with a major U.S. <br/>
Corporation and I make pretty good money. <br/>
<br/>
When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about <br/>
receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole <br/>
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages <br/>
involved. I 'knew'' it wouldn't work. <br/>
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she <br/>
jumped in with both feet. I made <br/>
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' <br/>
on her when the thing didn't <br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50<br/>
responses. Within the next 45 days she had received a total <br/>
$147,200.00<br/>
<br/>
............. all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in <br/>
her "hobby".<br/>
<br/>
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois<br/>
======================================================<br/>
"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my <br/>
mind to participate in this plan. <br/>
But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was <br/>
so little that there was just no <br/>
way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back".<br/>
<br/>
"I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed <br/>
with orders. I made $319,210.00 <br/>
in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does <br/>
not matter where people live. <br/>
There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so <br/>
big."<br/>
<br/>
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada<br/>
=======================================================<br/>
"I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I <br/>
wondered if I should have given it a <br/>
try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so <br/>
I had to wait until I was <br/>
e-mailed again by someone else......... 11 months passed then it <br/>
luckily came again......<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try <br/>
and all the money came within 22 <br/>
weeks."<br/>
<br/>
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.<br/>
=======================================================<br/>
"I tried another 5 dollar thing on the internet and I blew my money <br/>
because everyone's email accounts <br/>
had been closed. I looked at this one very carefully and realised <br/>
that no-one can stop it from <br/>
working. In my first try I was only a novice and received $740 in the <br/>
first two weeks. <br/>
In the next 2 monthes I received a total of $34 260 dollars US. Since <br/>
I'm in Sydney, the conversion <br/>
makes that around $68 500 dollars. I have already started the second <br/>
round and since I started 6 weeks <br/>
ago I have received $17,000 all in CASH !<br/>
<br/>
Simon Fahey, floor sander, Sydney, Australia.<br/>
=======================================================<br/>
"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with <br/>
little cost to you. I followed <br/>
the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money <br/>
started to come in. My first month I <br/>
made $20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was<br/>
$362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet."<br/>
