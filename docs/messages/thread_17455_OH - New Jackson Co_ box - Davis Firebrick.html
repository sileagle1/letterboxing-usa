This is the 8th (I think!) box in our `Legends of Jackson County' <br/>
series.<br/>
<br/>
After being lured to Jackson County largely by the availability of <br/>
salt, it didn't take the early pioneers long to become aware of the <br/>
other mineral resources here.  They quickly discovered coal, iron <br/>
ore, and vast deposits of clay that were particularly good for making <br/>
bricks.  All types of bricks were made locally but some of the most <br/>
well known were firebricks made by the Davis Firebrick Company of Oak <br/>
Hill, Ohio.  Firebricks are highly resistant to heat and are used to <br/>
line the fireboxes of stoves, furnaces, and boilers.  Sadly, no <br/>
bricks at all are made in Jackson County now but if you have an older <br/>
wood-burning stove at home don't be surprised to see the Davis <br/>
Firebrick logo down in the firebox.<br/>
<br/>
To find this box, it will help if you remember the name of Ralphie's <br/>
little brother in my favorite Christmas movie, "A Christmas Story."<br/>
