                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow! Sure does get dark early with the time change here on the east coast!!<br/>
Checked on three of my Delaware Canal letterboxes during the trip home from <br/>
work today. All are dry and in very good condition. Two, "Lock 21" and "Gold <br/>
Fish" are waiting for their first visitors.  "Have Bike Will Travel" has <br/>
alittle adventure to share...<br/>
The Park system is going to great lengths to preserve the history of the <br/>
canal and alot of rebuilding is going on. "Have Bike.." was hidden under a <br/>
board of a bridge between the canal and the Delaware River, a tight squeeze <br/>
and maybe alittle iffy, but I had already checked on it once after planting <br/>
and all was well.<br/>
This afternoon I was very surprised as I walked up to it's location to see <br/>
that a "new" wooden bridge had replaced the previous, (one that had looked <br/>
perfectly good to me..), I thought, Oh well...one box down the drain! Too <br/>
bad I thought, I liked that stamp, but when I reached down to see if there <br/>
was any space to possibily plant a replacement, there was the box!!<br/>
Whoever rebuilt the bridge had found the box and when finished had tucked it <br/>
back in, with more space and better coverage...wow! Bless their open minded <br/>
hearts!!<br/>
Whoever and wherever you are, thankyou.<br/>
