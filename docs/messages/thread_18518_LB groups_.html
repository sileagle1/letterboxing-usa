<br/>
There is at least one exception to this that I know of.  For awhile <br/>
there was a group of letter boxer's known as "Googled".  "Googled" <br/>
had its majority of members in the Central Coast area of California <br/>
(San Luis Obispo) and then had a few members that seemed to stretch <br/>
from coast to coast.  If you go look at old posts I am sure you can <br/>
find a few tag lines that say "Pandy of Googled" or some such <br/>
thing.  Anyways, "Googled" was a bit of an exclusive club; its <br/>
membership was based on a down line of letter boxers.  One of the <br/>
members of the group had originally found out about letterboxing <br/>
when searching for the name of the book store they worked in on the <br/>
Google search engine and then began rapidly getting her friends <br/>
involved. So if you came into letterboxing by this individual, or <br/>
anyone that she got involved in letterboxing or anyone someone she <br/>
got involved got involved and so on and so forth, then you were <br/>
considered a member of "Googled".  <br/>
<br/>
"Googled" started out as a very cool and very fun group.  There were <br/>
rules as far as what constituted a Google sponsored letterbox, there <br/>
had to be at least three members of "Googled" there when it was <br/>
planted. <br/>
<br/>
I know that I personally was involved in the "creation" so to speak <br/>
of the idea for the "Googled" group. My vision at the time was much <br/>
more than a group of people that boxed together.  As a matter of <br/>
fact when I (for personal reasons) decided to remove myself from <br/>
the "Googled" group and started "Team Chaos" I still had those <br/>
visions. Visions of a group of local letter boxers, that got <br/>
together on a regular basis to do all sorts of fun things that <br/>
involved letterboxing.  Carving nights, discussion nights, seminars <br/>
with well known letter boxers as speakers and all sorts of other <br/>
things, however, letter boxers tend to be very reclusive at times <br/>
and Team Chaos never became anything more than my family members. <br/>
<br/>
As for "Googled" it is the only group I have ever seen in the <br/>
letterboxing community that did what it did.  But as with anything <br/>
that either directly or indirectly evokes elitism, egos get and <br/>
feelings get bumped and bruised and eventually everything comes to <br/>
an end.  You don't see "Googled" around at all anymore. <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I hope I have given a little insight on what letterboxing <br/>
groups have been, could be, might be, and why you don't see many of <br/>
them around.<br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well,<br/>

You are exactly correct, at least in our case, Mama Stork.  Our trail <br/>
name refers to our immediate family members.  We always letterbox <br/>
together because at the moment our child is young enough that he <br/>
doesn't have a choice.  He even gets to ride most of the way.  We <br/>
actually have individual trail names but, we have yet to use them.<br/>
