Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
It seems like new members join the usa group all the time, so I thought<br/>
I'd repost about our SENewYork group. There aren't many of us because,<br/>
well, there aren't that many boxers in the area. Many of us have to make<br/>
road trips to do much of our boxing. But we're here and we love to<br/>
letterbox, however we have to do it, locally or by hitting the highways<br/>
of nearby (and not so nearby) areas.<br/>
<br/>
Three of us met recently at a gathering in Mr. Kisco, New York, held at<br/>
the Westmoreland Sanctuary and Museum. It's always great to put a face<br/>
with the trailname.<br/>
<br/>
If you live in one of the five boroughs of New York City, or<br/>
Westchester, Rockland, Suffolk, Orange, Nassau, or Putnam County, this<br/>
is a small, private group for those who love letterboxing and want to<br/>
perhaps meet and greet other boxers nearby for exchanges or boxing in<br/>
this area or others. Maybe you are looking for boxing buddies? Maybe you<br/>
just want to talk about your favorite hobby?<br/>
<br/>
We're a friendly group and welcome new people.<br/>
<br/>
So if you're in our area, please join us in our favorite hobby.<br/>
