Greetings:<br/>
I don't presently have a way of editing my letterboxes (home computer <br/>
down with a probable bad hard-drive) so I'm noting verification on <br/>
three of them here.  Despite some drastic grounds-maintenance by some <br/>
kind and understanding souls, two remained in place, safe 'n sound:  <br/>
Blueberry Patch (Schuyler) and Women's Hall of Fame (Seneca).  The <br/>
former has had 65 finders in three years, to be the most popular - <br/>
and perhaps easiest of mine.  Sassafras Pond (Schuyler) is also OK, <br/>
tho the trail to it has been kinda wet all summer and into the fall.<br/>
I should also mention that a recent trip to Maine has permitted me to <br/>
revisit the Mystery LB - "LLB-LB", which has also so far survived <br/>
likely grounds-people intervention.<br/>
Also. on that trip I stopped at Quechee Gorge in Vermont and found <br/>
those two.  Since my Dad was born and raised a few miles away toward <br/>
White River Jct. these had special meaning for me.<br/>
