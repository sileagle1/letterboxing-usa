the hike.  It must be truly spectacular later in the spring when the<br/>
trees are flowering, or in the fall.  Thanks Melissa, Dan and Max!<br/>

<br/>
We were at the 1833 monument last week!  We thought about going back yesterday, but the time grew late.  The ground was quite squishy last week and the foundation (RI stamp) was holding a couple of feet of water.  I was hoping to get to Molly Day, originally, but there were some family/friend snafus that kept us away. :-(    <br/>
<br/>
We did manage to get out and box a bit anyway, going for the Laurel and Hardy boxes in Glocester.  Great stamps! I really like this little hunting area and its waterfall.  I have a comment for creators Teach and Preach and those seeking these boxes:  <br/>
<br/>
The directions tell you to look for a red arrow.  We kept missing it!  It is hardly noticeable in certain light.  Or all 3 of us need our eyesight checked. Just go slow from the get-go because the waypoints start to appear soon into the walk.  Also, the number given on the pole refers to some manufacturing mark, and all the poles have that number (#355-41) stamped into the wood somewhere.  We got all fouled up trying to find the NET&amp;T numbers, which are mostly broken off the poles.  Anyone can find these boxes without the number, though.  Someone had been there yesterday before us and had stamped into both boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I recognized the area from seeking the Burlingame Reservoir box last year, created by Latte Man, but couldn't recall anything but the "bridge," which is gone!  We went back today with the clues for this box and it was right where I thought.  The long-legged can jump the waterfall, the more cautious, like myself, may choose to go up and around by crossing over the I-beams and backtracking down the opposite side of the stream.  It was great going back for this one, because another thing I hadn't rememnbered was that last year this was a spur-of-the-moment hike and Betz and I had no stamps with us.  I'm stamped in now. ;-)  So are you, Betz, in abstentia, by Dan the Safari Man.  This box has not had many visitors, what with the bridge out, and the bridge was a little shaky to begin with.  But it's do-able!  <br/>
