I'll be in the DC area for the next two weeks and plan to cover <br/>
Leesylvania SP.  I'll post the status of the boxes I'm able to find.  <br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend the Acotink Bay Wildlife Refuge (road rally clues) <br/>
box.  It was one of the most enjoyable hunts for me.  I was there <br/>
last May and the box was fine.  The trail was under water around <br/>
marker 8 and I had to reverse and pick up the clues from the <br/>
backside, but was happy to finally find the box.  It's not an easy <br/>
one by any means, but lots of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Amanda for the update on the Columbia SC boxes.  I'm please <br/>
you found them safe.  As for the Hitchhiker...that's one <br/>
lucky "escaped ape".  In your line of work, he's bound to get out of <br/>
town in a big way!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting,<br/>
