We just happened to be hunting your letterbox this past Saturday <br/>
(7/13) and upon arrival, we found the owners of the private property <br/>
that your letterbox was on the border of breaking up the large rocks <br/>
with a plan to remove them.  They found your box and fortunately for <br/>
us, allowed us to stamp it.  However, they plan to discard the box if <br/>
you do not come and place it elsewhere.  We placed it to the very far <br/>
right of the rocks in question near the very left side of the fence.<br/>
<br/>
Please reply if you can to let us know that you got this message.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Thanks so much for saving the box!!!....the box had many visitors and <br/>
it would have been a shame to lose all those stamps!<br/>
I am going to relocate the box in the area this weekend. Possibly in <br/>
the same area (since the problem was with the box being on the border <br/>
of private property)...but we'll have to see...The Fredericksburg <br/>
area has a lot of decent box places.<br/>
Thanks again...and thanks to all of you who stopped by, Hope you got <br/>
a kick out of the "church"!<br/>
