                    <div class="plaintext-content">A friend who tried my "Run for the Border" mystery box alerted me to <br/>
the fact that I can't count to five correctly, so one of the <br/>
calculations came out wrong.  I've since fixed that in the clue.  I <br/>
also added instructions for what should count as a chair and window, <br/>
since there seemed to be some confusion about that.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, I've replaced the missing box from the Los Osos Oaks <br/>
series (the Oak Tree box), so it's back in action for those who might <br/>
have missed it before.  I hid it in a slightly different (but <br/>
hopefully more concealed) spot, so if you've found it before, it's no <br/>
longer in the same location.  The clue has not changed, though, since <br/>
it's still in the same tree.<br/>
<br/>
Webmeisters: No changes are necessary on the website.  The links <br/>
point to my own clues that I can (and have) updated myself.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
