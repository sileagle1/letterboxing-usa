                    <div class="plaintext-content">I tried something for the first time this morning &amp; I think it has <br/>
potential at least for some drawings.<br/>
<br/>
I'd read about doing a transfer using transparency material but when <br/>
I priced the stuff at Staples the other day it was far more than I <br/>
wanted to spend &amp; far more material than I could imagine using.  So <br/>
thinking that the film is just a sort of plastic here's what I <br/>
tried.  I took a clear sleeve like you put an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of <br/>
paper in to put it in a 3 ring binder.  I cut off the part where the <br/>
holes for putting it in the binder are so it would go through my <br/>
printer - an HP deskjet.  Then I put a piece of paper in the sleeve <br/>
so that it would hopefully feed through the printer - that worked.<br/>
<br/>
I ran it through the printer then after it had dried a bit I pressed <br/>
it on to my carving material.  This worked very well for a line type <br/>
image.  Did not work so well when the image had a lot of solid ink <br/>
areas - maybe need to let it dry longer for those before trying to <br/>
transfer.  I intend to experiment some more.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Unfortunately the acetone transfer and the heat transfer don't work <br/>
with inkjet prints, rather they need a toner-based ink.  You could <br/>
take them to Kinkos or Staples Copy Center and run a copy there, <br/>
which would be toner-based -- if you fill up an entire sheet with <br/>
images for stamps, you will get the most for your money.<br/>
<br/>
Another method is to trace the entire printed design with pencil and <br/>
then lay it face down on your carving material and rub it <br/>
vigorously, being careful not to move it, with your fingernail or a <br/>
bone folder.  The pencil will then transfer to the carving medium.  <br/>
If it is too light to work with, take a pen and go over it once it <br/>
is on the rubber.<br/>
<br/>
Or if you are artistic, you could just draw it onto the carving <br/>
material -- but remember to draw it backward or else it will stamp <br/>
backward.<br/>

to use a paper that's not too absorbent and VERY QUICKLY move the <br/>

There is another way to transfer images which I've found to be <br/>
the easiest and most precise method of transfer. Read about it <br/>
