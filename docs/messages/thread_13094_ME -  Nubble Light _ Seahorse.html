Light House - gorgeous view - though it was very busy as the rain let <br/>
up for a couple hours and everyone raced out to try to enjoy the <br/>
day.  Spectacular place to sit and enjoy the view.  Found the <br/>
letterbox with little difficulty and didn't compromise it's location -<br/>
which was quite the challenge.  Really need to reach under to snag <br/>
the box. <br/>
Headed to Seahorse afterwards but couldn't find it.  I was the first <br/>
at the park and had the full attention of the workers there so it was <br/>
hard to really search it out.  Found a geocache which isn't even <br/>
listed on the geocaching webpage.  Thought maybe another couple was <br/>
there to letterbox so I'd be interested if anyone finds it.  I am <br/>
back in CT but hope to visit again soon!<br/>
