I've tried both hobbies and don't really care much for geocaching myself but I'm thinking of placing a hybrid box to see how it goes. The directions would clearly state Take Nothing Leave Nothing, Sign Log (TNLNSL) to avoid people taking the stamp or leaving junk.<br/>

<br/>
I'd think that if you're going to make the box a hybrid for geocaching, you're going to have to allow for "junk" to be left, since that's how they play their game, and do your best to educate them that "the stamp stays!"  <br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>

That particular hybrid had clearly marked instructions to not take <br/>

My hubby is a geocacher, and after I dragged him along<br/>
on many LB searches, I went with him after a geocach<br/>
(hey, it was only fair).  To my suprise and delight,<br/>
inside the cache was a small container marked<br/>
"Letterbox hybrid - geocachers DO NOT trade".  There<br/>
was a small stamp and logbook inside.<br/>
<br/>
This LB was NOT listed on LbNA, so what a nice<br/>
suprise!  I think as long as the LB items are clearly<br/>
marked, it's a nice addition to letterboxing. And it<br/>
gives those of us who enjoy both hobbies a chance to<br/>
do them at the same time!!!<br/>
<br/>
I still prefer LB'ing, though.  Geocaching ONLY when<br/>
the hubby insists!!  ;)<br/>

I picked up a geocache that could have been a hybrid. The clue <br/>
indicated that the cache was located in an unused section of an old, <br/>
small town cemetery. Didn't need a GPS for that part, it was the only <br/>
cemetery in town. Coordinates for the stash site were given, but the <br/>
hint read "Look up, not down". There were 2 large trees out in the <br/>
middle of this smallish fenced-in field and the cache was hidden in <br/>
the roots of one of the trees.<br/>
