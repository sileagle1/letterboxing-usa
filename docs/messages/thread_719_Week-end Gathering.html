                    <div class="plaintext-content">Tomorrow evening the first batch of east-coast letterboxers will be <br/>
gathering at the Inn at Long Trail in Killington, Vermont. The <br/>
weather forecast for Saturday is brisk - 40 to 45 highs, with a <br/>
chance of rain or snow in the morning. So bring warm clothes.<br/>
<br/>
The inn will be very cozy: wood fires and a hot tub. Bring a bathing <br/>
suit and a bathrobe.<br/>
<br/>
There are three letterboxes there at Sherburne Pass. I will have <br/>
clues available for them, as well as for the other 60+ boxes within <br/>
an hour's drive. The four of us arriving tomorrow can make our plans <br/>
in the tub tomorrow evening or next morning at breakfast. We can hunt <br/>
together or alone, as people like.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday night will be the big gathering, as Erik &amp; Susan, Randy, <br/>
Bonnie, and Steve of ValleyQuest arrive. Clues for the McGrath's Pub <br/>
Letterbox will be given out once everyone is on hand. The Wind That <br/>
Shakes the Barley will be playing in the pub that evening, while the <br/>
letterboxers stumble about garnishing clues or retiring to table to <br/>
recoup. Jay Drew may conceivably arrive around midnight to assess the <br/>
state of the first North American Letterboxers Convention. Who knows <br/>
- perhaps the Moorland Wizard will pop in to sample the local <br/>
microbrews? (There is Guinness on tap as well, Graham, if Long Trail <br/>
Ale seems dubious!)<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait.<br/>

fact, this evening after dinner I was telling a couple friends about how <br/>
much fun it was finding those two boxes, but when we went online we couldn't <br/>
access the AOL page.<br/>

Anyway, I didn't know about the hot tub at the Inn at Long Trail! <br/>
Woohoo!!!!!   Hot tubs and Guinness seem like a killer combination to me.  <br/>

Hello all, <br/>
<br/>
As a veteran of the Vermont ValleyQuest, I highly recommend the downtown <br/>
Norwich Vermont letterbox.  It is full of history, and the final destination <br/>
of the box is brilliant.<br/>

Have fun!<br/>

I'd be glad to email clues separately to anyone for the weekend (or for<br/>

&gt; wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The question is -- is anyone on this list (Tom?) able to get to these clues<br/>
from the links from the dots on the VT, NH, MA, CT, and RI maps.  Then we<br/>
can narrow down if its an AOL problem or a browser version problem (I'm<br/>
using netscape 4.05; perhaps one needs a more modern browser).  So basically<br/>
it boils down to is it the clients or the server.<br/>
<br/>
I'll try from work with a more modern browser, but most likely I will not<br/>
be able to get to the clues before this weekend, so if someone who is <br/>
going to the inn and _can_ get to them (Tom?) could do me a favor and print<br/>
them out, I'd appreciate it (as might Bonnie) (Note that this only applies<br/>
to Drew's clues, I can get to all of our other clues).<br/>
<br/>
I will also be leaving for VT straigt from work so will not be able to <br/>
check e-mail at home.  If someone wants, they can e-mail these clues to<br/>
randyhall@lucent.com<br/>
<br/>
I guess I should have dealt with this problem before the last minute :-)<br/>

Thx all,<br/>

&gt;Tomorrow evening the first batch of east-coast letterboxers will be <br/>
&gt;gathering at the Inn at Long Trail in Killington, Vermont. The <br/>
&gt;weather forecast for Saturday is brisk - 40 to 45 highs, with a <br/>
&gt;chance of rain or snow in the morning. So bring warm clothes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow you say...ahh well maybe a "tad" short on the notice...but it's<br/>
great to hear about the way Letterboxing in America is maintaining the<br/>
honourable and most noble tradition of gathering in a hostelry of great<br/>
cheer..<lol> <br/>
<br/>
As Deborah (MixtMedia) says I too will certainly be with you in spirit..<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure which one <g>...but I will raise my glass to you at around<br/>
the time I expect you will be gathering..so if a faint Wizard-like<br/>
sensation of good will and well being suddenly descends..well who know<br/>
<chuckle !=""><br/>
<br/>
.on Saturday Father Christmas..(that our version of Santa) is arriving at<br/>
Harrods of Knightsbridge (London) at about 8:30 am and my son and I will<br/>
be there to see the parade...Not quite a Macy's parade but nevertheless<br/>
one he wouldn't want to miss..so I cant quite make the trip to Vermont<br/>
just in time ..sad to say <grin><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are three letterboxes there at Sherburne Pass. I will have <br/>
&gt;clues available for them, as well as for the other 60+ boxes within <br/>
&gt;an hour's drive. The four of us arriving tomorrow can make our plans <br/>
&gt;in the tub tomorrow evening or next morning at breakfast. We can hunt <br/>
&gt;together or alone, as people like.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would just love to be with you..it sounds so wonderful..Is this a new<br/>
annual meet..<br/>
"Autumn Letterboxing Trails in Vermont ?"...should I book the 2000 event<br/>
now ?  <br/>
Put me down a delegate No. 1 if that's the case.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Saturday night will be the big gathering, as Erik &amp; Susan, Randy, <br/>
&gt;Bonnie, and Steve of ValleyQuest arrive. Clues for the McGrath's Pub <br/>
&gt;Letterbox will be given out once everyone is on hand. The Wind That <br/>
&gt;Shakes the Barley will be playing in the pub that evening, while the <br/>
&gt;letterboxers stumble about garnishing clues or retiring to table to <br/>
&gt;recoup. Jay Drew may conceivably arrive around midnight to assess the <br/>
&gt;state of the first North American Letterboxers Convention. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It reads more and more like a real US style convention ...fantastic idea..<br/>
........and what a great list of "guests of honour"...I would be humbled<br/>
in such a wonderful company...<br/>
<br/>
My sincerest best wishes for a great event ..and good huntin.....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Who knows - perhaps the Moorland Wizard will pop in to sample the local <br/>
&gt;microbrews? (There is Guinness on tap as well, Graham, if Long Trail <br/>
&gt;Ale seems dubious!)<br/>
<br/>
This is becoming seriously more tempting line by line..<chuckle> <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Happy days and a great convention !!<br/>

I didn't get to the Norwich box two weeks ago, but did get down <br/>
today. I agree that it is one of the nicest boxes I've seen in the <br/>
ValleyQuest series.<br/>
<br/>
As an elementary school teacher in central Vermont, I'm curious about <br/>
your history with ValleyQuest.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Hello all, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a veteran of the Vermont ValleyQuest, I highly recommend the downtown <br/>
&gt; Norwich Vermont letterbox.  It is full of history, and the final destination <br/>
&gt; of the box is brilliant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have fun!<br/>
