                    <div class="plaintext-content">One tip to Newbies, if you want a little variety in your notebook <br/>
take a couple of different colors of ink pad with you!  I started out <br/>
with just one ink-pad and for the first 8 pages of my notebook, <br/>
nothing but green, green, green....It got kind of monotonous.<br/>
I was so glad to find a letterbox that had a little orange ink-pad <br/>
inside!!  But I agree that there is the risk of the ink-pad inside <br/>
the letterbox leaking and/or drying out. I won't put one in my <br/>
letterboxes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings Everyone:<br/>
    Yes, there are many solutions to the ink pad and<br/>
zip-lock baggie dilema! Personally, the oldest<br/>
letterboxs that I have ever been to (Misery loves co.<br/>
an Elaine and Jerry's Bluff)were contained in a wide<br/>
mouth screw-top Nalgene Bottle which included the<br/>
following items: 1 original store bought stamp, 1<br/>
original 1"x1" stamp pad (the kind you can get at A.C.<br/>
Moore or Micheals crafts for about $1), 1 original<br/>
weatherproof logbook (I have seen some 3x5 bound index<br/>
cards in a similar box), 1 pen, and 1 "what is<br/>
letterboxing" leaflet.<br/>
     My point is this: In any of the circumstances<br/>
where I have found a letterbox of similar description,<br/>
I have never found any "moisture" in the letterbox,<br/>
never a leaky ink pad, never a runny pen... granted<br/>
the weatherproof logbooks don't work that great,but,<br/>
the index cards were a good improvement. I never found<br/>
excessive insects in the box, a mauled or chewed<br/>
letterbox...<br/>
    MAybe, just maybe the people who brought this<br/>
hobby (sport) over from England, when they set it up,<br/>
they may have done it this way for a purpose... it<br/>
seems that only recently, with all of our<br/>
"improvements" has there been any complaint of fouled<br/>
boxes. I've been giving serious thought as to whether<br/>
or not I should change from the "seal-tite" rubbermaid<br/>
boxes back to the screw tops... If I recieve any<br/>
complaints about the above listed problems, than I<br/>
might just do that.. but untill then I will include an<br/>
ink pad, and a pen, and at the very least a hand<br/>
written "what is letterboxing" in the logbook... never<br/>
know when you might throw together a new box in the<br/>
field from a repair kit.... I've started carrying<br/>
carving medium and my speedball with me!!!<br/>
<br/>
These are just some ideas and reflections on my part.<br/>
<br/>
Many boxes to you!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My thoughts on the inkpad and container debate:<br/>
<br/>
1) In about 50 boxes, I have never come across a box with a dried-out <br/>
inkpad. As long as the box was intact, so was the inkpad.<br/>
<br/>
2) The 1" square inkpads work great for all size stamps. The cost is <br/>
negligible. ($1.00 to $1.50.)<br/>
<br/>
3) Some people prefer to put inkpads in with the box because they <br/>
have expended great care in carving the stamp and choose to have a <br/>
complimentary-colored inkpad to accompany their artwork.<br/>
<br/>
4) DON'T "CHEAP-OUT" ON CONTAINERS. Whether you plant just 1 box in <br/>
your lifetime or 300 boxes, you've taken much time and trouble to <br/>
share this act of kindness with many grateful people. MAKE YOUR BOXES <br/>
LONG-LASTING. USE GOOD MATERIALS. Two of the best systems I have come <br/>
across were: John Rovetto's "Rubbermaid-inside-a-Rubbermaid" system. <br/>
Both good-quality containers with the smaller fitting perfectly <br/>
inside the next size up. And just for good measure, everything inside <br/>
was Ziplock freezer bagged.  Also easily affordable. The other good <br/>
system I like is the wide-mouth Nalgene bottles; they're a bit <br/>
pricier, however, but really nice and watertight. <br/>
<br/>
5) Attention newbies: Gladware SUCKS. It's light, flimsy, cracks <br/>
easily and leaks if you so much as breathe on it. Enough said.<br/>
<br/>
6) I fully understand individual choice and rationale for not wanting <br/>
to include an inkpad in your letterbox. I, however, will probably <br/>
always include an inkpad because I feel it makes the box a <br/>
more "complete package" and accommodating to the finder.<br/>
