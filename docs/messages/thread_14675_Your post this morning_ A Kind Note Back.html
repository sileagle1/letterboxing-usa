                    <div class="plaintext-content">I do share your view on the hitchhiker, and I do agree that there are some on <br/>
the list that are very unkind.  Please do not view that unkindness as the <br/>
majority, since there are more than 1000 subscribers to the list.<br/>
<br/>
I do have to stress that there aren't only Christians on the list, but people <br/>
from every walk of life.  However, that doesn't mean that everyone that is a <br/>
non-Christian is kind, just as there are unkind.  Concerning the hitchhiker, <br/>
if you come across it, don't stamp it in your book and leave it for the next <br/>
person.  Most hitchhikers have their name printed on the bag or box.  If you <br/>
read the box, and it is an inappropriate hitchhiker to you, then don't open it.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is a family activity, and I know of no boxes that are <br/>
pornographic in any way, however, there are boxes that share other views of religion.  <br/>
These boxes should be duly noted in their clues, so that people who do not want <br/>
to be subject to these views can avoid them.<br/>
<br/>
As per the pagans on the list, I feel as though there was one letterboxer who <br/>
wanted to find more people like his own, and I really don't think there was <br/>
any harm in that.  I don't think that person was malicious in their intent <br/>
(however, I feel that some others who got on the band wagon were very rude <br/>
indeed).  I am certainly a Christian, but I have grown to tolerate and become friends <br/>
with others from other religions and walks of life.  I do not exclude and go <br/>
on tyrant rampages (like some on the list) about people different from their <br/>
own.  If I see a post that I don't agree with and the thread is starting to get <br/>
ugly, I simply don't read the rest of the posts.  The "Delete" key is a <br/>
wonderful thing!<br/>
<br/>
I sincerely hope that you don't write a malicious letter to the magazine, <br/>
just perhaps an objective one.  We are not all bad :-)<br/>
