letterbox in Goodwin Forest last august of 2001. It was close to a <br/>
bridge... and this august (2002) we went back to replace the notepad <br/>
(so there may not be anyone stamped in yet). What did the stamp look <br/>
like in this box you found? We will go check on our box as soon as we <br/>
have time, but anyone with info on the Bear Family letterbox please <br/>
let us know asap! Thank you!<br/>
