                    <div class="plaintext-content">On March 23, 2003 Funhog placed the Mandan Heron Letterbox in Sarpy<br/>
County, Omaha, Nebraska. Like all herons, this one chose to roost in a<br/>
tall tree, close to water. The walk to this box definitely lays to<br/>
rest the myth that Nebraska is flat. This hike may involve some<br/>
creative trailblazing. Since you will also encounter an active<br/>
railroad line along the way, this may not be the best place to bring<br/>
rambunctious kids or dogs.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: The entrance to Mandan Park is located at 13th and<br/>
Harrison close to the Bellevue city limits. <br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: Once inside the park, find the shelter with three<br/>
walls and a roof that provides no refuge in a storm. From this point<br/>
take the trail at 30 degrees magnetic to a grassy clearing. Find the<br/>
four non-conformists holding needles but cannot sew. From the smallest<br/>
of this quartet take the trail at 80 degrees. After walking through<br/>
walls of stone count 125 steps to the woodland strongbox. At this<br/>
point make a hairpin turn downhill, continuing along an eroded<br/>
streambank. Your goal is the railroad track down below. Walk southeast<br/>
along the tracks until you see eight oranges suspended in midair. With<br/>
one of these floating directly overhead, take a compass reading of 10<br/>
degrees to the tallest riverside tree, perfect for a heron rookery.<br/>
