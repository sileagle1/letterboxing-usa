<br/>
That's not necessarily true: Many people across the country aren't <br/>
interested in postal boxes.  Regional talk lists were created not to <br/>
segregate people, but to help separate posts by topic.  In that <br/>
case, it happened to be by region.  But the hitchhiker talk list was <br/>
created for the same reason--not everyone was interested in the <br/>
chatter about hitchhikers, so somebody created a separate board for <br/>
it.  Those who are interested can join that talk list, and those <br/>
that aren't don't have to wade through posts about it on the main <br/>
board.<br/>
<br/>
It's no different with postal boxes.  I for one am not a big fan of <br/>
them.  A box that comes to you strikes me as a new low in laziness.  <br/>
There's some great artwork in them, but for the most part, I'm <br/>
really not interested.  I've never signed up to get one and probably <br/>
never will.  I skip any posts pertaining to them.<br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong, I'm not out trying to kill the idea of postal <br/>
boxes.  They don't hurt anything and I can't honestly make an <br/>
impassioned plea that it's wrong--it's not.  It's just not something <br/>
I care about.  A personal preference.  And there are a LOT of us out <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Just because postal boxes are 'national' in nature doesn't mean <br/>
there's universal interest in them.  These new groups that are <br/>
popping up are meant to help bring under control the overwhelming <br/>
number of posts to the main talk list, and segmenting the groups by <br/>
topics is an excellent start.  Regions are one way of doing it, but <br/>
so are the type of letterboxes being discussed.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I'm not sure who created the postal box group, but I'm glad <br/>
there's one out there.  I won't miss the chatter about postal boxes <br/>
on the main list, and those that do enjoy postal boxes have their <br/>
own forum to discuss the topic.  Seems like a win-win situation to <br/>
me.<br/>

These new talk lists based on region or letterbox type seem more <br/>

And I am thrilled to know that my posts can bring a smile to your face!<br/>
<br/>
I, myself, prefer the forum approach and not because my website uses them,<br/>
but because of the ability to correlate messages by topic.  Because I get an<br/>
email when something new is posted to the topic that I am watching and not<br/>
when anything else is posted, though, if I choose, I can peruse the topic<br/>
lists and watch new topics as they develop.  I don't have to wade through<br/>
300 messages when a flame war erupts, unless I choose to.  I can even reach<br/>
it through my PDA as well using AvantGo.  And, best of all, if I am reading<br/>
it through a web browser, I don't have to deal with clicking on a message,<br/>
expecting to get the message text and being interrupted by a Ad first,<br/>
before I am allowed to read the message. But that's just me and my<br/>
preferences.  I don't really like mailing lists because things get so out of<br/>
hand, not to say that they can't and haven't on a forum.<br/>

    I suspect that there will always be new chatting about older topics until each new person discovers the other lists - that's fine, since it gives us a fun boost of that fresh, new enthusiasm.  I believe the regional lists may be the most helpful, and I'm glad they're proliferating!<br/>

<br/>
Hey, you're preaching to the choir!  I agree whole-heartedly about <br/>
the forum approach--it's a great system for segregating posts based <br/>
on topics of interest.  The lack of forums is my biggest complaint <br/>
about the Yahoo Groups system.  (That, and why the heck did they <br/>
even put in some of the stupid 'features' they have such as the <br/>
database.)<br/>
<br/>
But still, the 'critical mass' is on Yahoo Groups, and I think it's <br/>
all but impossible to move it elsewhere.  Doesn't matter how good or <br/>
bad your forums are, but I think they're doomed to fail if for no <br/>
other reason than missing out on the 'first mover' advantage.  It's <br/>
a hard advantage to overcome.<br/>

I don't really like mailing lists because things get so out of<br/>
hand, not to say that they can't and haven't on a forum.<br/>
