                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great interview Mark!  Thanks so much for bringing us the <br/>
perspective of a letterboxing pioneer, which ironically was a breath <br/>
of fresh air.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot help but wonder at the fact that there have been no <br/>
comments on this interview on this talk list, yet there continues to <br/>
be useless, repetitive drivel about the same old stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, based on the last 12 pages of posts it is evident that <br/>
many people in letterboxing today don't care about about its history <br/>
and have little respect for those who wrote it here in the US.  I <br/>
was appalled at the lack of respect shown in a message asking "who <br/>
is Phyto, why do we care?" and also during a recent thread on one of <br/>
the regional lists which also showed a blatant disregard for <br/>
letterboxing roots in the US.<br/>
<br/>
I also find it curious that several of the posts I have seen over <br/>
the past couple of weeks include comments such as "I have only found <br/>
5 boxes..." or "I have not yet planted my first box..."  Hey, I <br/>
think it is great that you and your family have found letterboxing <br/>
and you are welcome at this list and any other, but perhaps it would <br/>
be wise to sit back and listen and try to learn before rushing in <br/>
with opinions.  Perhaps with a bit of experience you will understand <br/>
WOM clues and you will understand why people are concerned about <br/>
boxes that are not rehidden well and you will understand who/why <br/>
publicity is a double-edged sword, and that nobody really hates <br/>
newbies, just the inevitable chaos that ensues when "fools rush in."<br/>
<br/>
So often newbies point fingers and say that those who have been <br/>
around a while aren't willing to teach -- when in actuality, it is <br/>
they who are not willing to listen.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know, more drivel on the same old thing...  So now I will <br/>
retreat back to my carving bench.  <br/>
