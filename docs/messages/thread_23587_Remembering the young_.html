                    <div class="plaintext-content">As no one would ever like for to happen, a young child was lost. 7 <br/>
years ago a young child was born. he had the most loving parents and <br/>
cared for him ever second they could. now there was only so much <br/>
they could do. you see, he was born with a sickness. a sickness that <br/>
takes children from there parents without notice. hypo-plastic left <br/>
heart syndrome. this is a sickness that doesn't allow the left side <br/>
of the heart to grow, making the right side work harder until it <br/>
just give up. now there is a surgery for this sickness, but death is <br/>
possible. the norwood procedure is a series of 3 surgeries. 2 days <br/>
after he was born, he was in for part 1 of the procedure. after <br/>
hours of waiting, he came out and recovered nicely. after spending <br/>
the first 2 1/2 months into his life, in the hospital, he finally <br/>
came home. after sometime, he went back into the hospital for part 2 <br/>
of the procedure. again he went in and came out recovered nicely.<br/>
<br/>
not to long later, this childs parents fell apart. things were hard <br/>
to handle. and then the day before the child was to be an 18 month <br/>
old, he suddenly past. right infront of his mother. his father was <br/>
living only up the steet when he got the word. 3 police officers <br/>
came to the door to deliver the horrific news. he had lost the last <br/>
6 months of his childs life.<br/>
<br/>
i regret ever moment i lost.<br/>
<br/>
--- His trip one day---<br/>
he planned on taking a trip one day,<br/>
but he wouldn't be traveling far.<br/>
this trip one day,<br/>
will be spur of the moment.<br/>
and he wouldn't be taking a car.<br/>
one day this trip would bring everyone together,<br/>
giving warnth and speading love.<br/>
a trip his family of the past had taken,<br/>
flying high in the clouds above.<br/>
for him one day that trip did come,<br/>
not a chance to say goodbye.<br/>
he's missing everyone when he took this trip,<br/>
when he closed his eyes and died.<br/>
one day.<br/>
