There *is* an unofficial club for folks who have found 100 boxes, but that's<br/>
not incredibly difficult to do.  A person can get a catalog and goferit<br/>
themselves as far as finding boxes, or find a friendly soul over there (not<br/>
hard to find) to take them around and help them out.  Friendly souls can<br/>
always be found already out on the search who will often be glad to lend a<br/>
hand if they see a person is struggling, and the struggling person puts on a<br/>
little bit of a begging face, and even friendlier souls can often be found<br/>
in the area pubs already friendlied up a bit.  A lot of pubs also have<br/>
indoor boxes similar to those in the U.S. where a person comes in, gives a<br/>
password, and receives the box.<br/>
<br/>
IIRC, in the past, *current* catalogues were kinda, sorta, rather,<br/>
restricted to member of the club, but anyone could buy a previous catalog.<br/>
Now, however, I don't think there's much of any problem for anyone to buy a<br/>
current catalog even.  And it's not really expensive.  Not prohibitively so<br/>
at all in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I never got involved over there because I found many clues to be<br/>
somewhat on the boring side, tho the stamps were cool.  Pippi and Keith<br/>
loved it but it wasn't my style.  I like that the U.S. placers are a little<br/>
more creative, a little more imaginative, etc.  But, obviously, that's just<br/>
my own personal opinion, and to each his/her own.  :-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The issue here is not about where you box and weather or not you have to collect 'x' amount of stamps before you can truely call yourself a 'letterboxer' but more about the way in which letterboxing appears to be becoming somewhat 'elitist'.  It is not a pastime soley reserved for those that box every weekend for 48hrs solid and have a finds list that would take you a week to read.  Letterboxing is about getting people, whatever their ability, out in to the 'wilds' and educating them about some of the most fantastic places one could wish to visit.  The letterboxing is simply a medium to execute this and, therefore, rather than keeping clues shrouded in mystery we should be saying to people - "here are the clues, see how many you can find. Oh, and whilst your out there take a good look around and discover the true nature of the environment" - rather than saying "well yeah I have planted thirty boxes but cant give you the clues because you haven't proved yourself as a boxer".<br/>
  I would rather spend a day with a new boxer who has 3 finds and a love of the moor than a 'number hunter' who has no interest in the moor but will speedmarch 30 miles if it means edging their finds list beyond that of their fellow boxers.<br/>
<br/>
  Put letterboxing on the map (excuse the pun :-) ) and get people out into the wilds and encourage them to learn about the great outdoors.  The amount of times I have encountered boxers on Dartmoor and spoken about nothing but the moor, the solitude, favourite tors and pubs and then upon departing have been told "oh, and theres a box under that rock" is testimony to the fact that the majority of people box because they have a passion for Dartmoor (myself included) and that letterboxing comes in second to this.<br/>
<br/>
  You can probably tell that my passion is for the outdoors and Dartmoor,  and that boxing is something that I do when I'm out there and I believe that this is how the pastime should be! I would defy anyone to spend time alone on Dartmoor and not come away feeling the same.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I guess I'll weigh in on the issue. Both parties are correct. But I digress<br/>
. . .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I accompanied the Bakers' Dozen to Dartmoor several years ago, I had<br/>
the occasion to arrange a surprise for our attendees - an enchanting evening<br/>
in a well-known pub in Princetown with Godfrey &amp; Anne Swinscow and Tony &amp;<br/>
Sylvia Moore. Many of you know Godfrey as "God" and the president and<br/>
founder of the Dartmoor 100 Club. His wife, Anne, is the author of several<br/>
books on Dartmoor letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tony and Sylvia Moore are lesser known, and quite shy, but equally as<br/>
important since they manage and compile the Dartmoor Catalogue of Clues that<br/>
is published twice a year, in the Spring and Fall, and contains the current<br/>
list of registered letterboxing clues. When you register a letterbox, you<br/>
receive an actual registration number that is also placed in the clues.<br/>
After 5 years, if you don't renew your registration, your clue is dropped<br/>
from the catalogue. That is the reason for the disparity in the number of<br/>
boxes in the Catalogue and the actual count of boxes on the moor. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I first emailed Tony, I explained we were leading a group to the moor<br/>
from the US and asked if I could purchase a book. He immediately agreed and<br/>
it wasn't unitl later that I learned of the 100 box requirement to get the<br/>
catalogue. It was sheer ignorance on my part.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That magical night in the pub I had the opportunity to thank Tony for what I<br/>
thought might have been preferential treatment in his sending the book<br/>
knowing that none of us had found even 1 Dartmoor box. Tony replied that<br/>
they are not as stringent as they were in the past with the 100 box<br/>
requirement. Call it evolution or changing ways or whatever you'd like but<br/>
their initial policy has been tempered with time. Might it be different if<br/>
you were a UK resident? Possibly, but I never asked that question.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So both opinions seem to be correct - there is and isn't a requirement.<br/>

&gt;   You can probably tell that my passion is for the outdoors and <br/>
Dartmoor,  and that boxing is something that I do when I'm out there <br/>
and I believe that this is how the pastime should be! I would defy <br/>
anyone to spend time alone on Dartmoor and not come away feeling the <br/>
same.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
Hi Andy<br/>
<br/>
Hope you are spending as much time as you can on the moor. Gwen and I <br/>
are still talking about our Dartmoor experience.<br/>

 &gt; I don't think it's at all what she does with her clues that get folks<br/>
 &gt; riled up, but the perceived tone of her posts that are easy to take<br/>
 &gt; offense to. At least that's my take on things, but what do I know. And<br/>
 &gt; I know people say it's so easy to misunderstand what people mean when<br/>
 &gt; reading a typed message blah, blah, blah. It's also just as easy to<br/>
 &gt; take a little extra time to make sure your message conveys a civil<br/>
 &gt; tone if you care about that sort of thing. But hey, everyone has a<br/>
 &gt; right to express themselves however they want. Last time I checked it<br/>
 &gt; was still a free country, thank goodness..<br/>
<br/>
You said what I was think, but is a much nicer, more graceful way.<br/>
