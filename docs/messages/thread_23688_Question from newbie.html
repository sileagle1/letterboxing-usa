  A great resource is the newboxers list. Check it out at:<br/>

<br/>
  Don't forgot to join your local boxing community (Mid-Atlantic Region) at:<br/>

<br/>
  Another site you should join is www.atlasquest.com , another source of clues, talk lists, event information.<br/>
<br/>
  And Silent Dougs site www.letterboxing.info is very helpful. Plus, he has some plants in our area.<br/>
