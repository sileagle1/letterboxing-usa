                    <div class="plaintext-content">What do you mean--a system to track your finds, plants and exchanges <br/>
within a log book or a tracking system via computer program?<br/>
<br/>
LOG BOOK SYSTEM:<br/>
<br/>
One thing that works for me is simply keeping a running tally in my <br/>
paper logbooks as we continue along on our letterboxing adventure.  <br/>
I keep the stamps in sequence whenever we find one, we stamp it.  If <br/>
we plant a box we stamp it in our log before we plant it.  If we <br/>
exchange sig stamps with other boxers then we stamp them in the <br/>
logbook, too.<br/>
<br/>
Specific system:  If we're out letterboxing and we find a new stamp, <br/>
we stamp it in--I label it the name of the letterbox, with the <br/>
placer (email if they left one in the logbook to contact them about <br/>
finding their letterbox), date we found it, location and then on the <br/>
left side I write F=(insert whatever number of boxes you've found).  <br/>
If it's a letterbox we've planted, we write the same info all around <br/>
the image and then put P=(insert whatever number of planted <br/>
letterbox we're at), if it's an exchange--same thing applies, we <br/>
just label it X=whatever number exchange we're on (I also put the <br/>
person's email address next to the stamp in the event they want to <br/>
keep in contact).  It keeps a running tally so we never have to go <br/>
back and count them all up again.<br/>
<br/>
VIRTUAL LOGBOOK:  On my website where I track all my planted <br/>
letterbox clues (www.leecomputers.com/letterboxing), I also have a <br/>
running tally of boxes we've found/planted/exchanged.  It's a <br/>
discussion board type of webpage and I simply have found, planted <br/>
and exchanged as different 'topics'.  I've separated them <br/>
in 'blocks' of 100 because after a while the pages get long and <br/>
rather difficult to manage.  One note of caution, though to help <br/>
folks AVOID A MAJOR FAUX PAX OF LETTERBOXING, never ever disclose <br/>
the whereabouts of mystery boxes on your list.  Also 'muddle' the <br/>
dates you've found them or the order in which you've found them <br/>
because sometimes just the location of other letterboxes you've <br/>
found on similar dates/locations may give away the mystery box.  I <br/>
also include attempts on my virtual log just to show folks that for <br/>
every 100 letterboxes we've actually found, we've probably looked <br/>
for some 25% more than that.  It may help encourage some folks who <br/>
get frustrated in this hobby--especially if they're located in an <br/>
area where folks who are REALLY crafty with clues have planted most <br/>
of the boxes. (I'm thinking Mapsurfer and legerdemain style of <br/>
letterboxes here)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.  Of course, it's quite obvious now I'm pretty <br/>
compulsive about this, isn't it?  ;)  Just wish I had more time to <br/>
go letterboxing these days...  :(<br/>

I set up a spreadsheet on Microsoft Excel to keep track of boxes <br/>
found, hitchhikers found, etc. I don't list boxes looked for but not <br/>
found, but this could be another column. I'm kind of new at <br/>
letterboxing so not too many entries yet, but the spreadsheet is <br/>
slowing growing. <br/>
