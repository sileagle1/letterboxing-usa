                    <div class="plaintext-content">Concord Point Lighthouse is in the same vicinity as the Maryland rest stops, but is worth a side trip (in my humble opinion.)  When we went to Lebanon, NJ for the 4th of July, we stopped at Pit Stop on the way up, and then did Gas-n-Go and Concord Point on the way back (we would have done both rest area boxes on the way up but it started pouring rain.)  The lighthouse is about 10 minutes off the highway and is this cute little spot with a dock and a nice walking path (but the box itself is a drive-by.)<br/>
<br/>
Even though the boxes added some time to our trips, especially since we stayed at Concord Point for about an hour to feed the baby and run my 5-year-old around, they broke up the trip SO nicely.  Next time we travel via highway I'd like to plant some similar boxes.  The rest area ones aren't exactly scenic, but I think they serve a high purpose all the same.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Happy travels, <br/>

<br/>
p.s.  Pit Stop and Concord Point Lighthouse are in Harford County and are listed under "Central Maryland," but Gas-n-Go is in Cecil County and is listed under "Eastern Shore Maryland."<br/>
