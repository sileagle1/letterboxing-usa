<br/>
These 2 letterboxes are located in Agate Beach County Park on the southern end of Lopez Island in the San Juan Islands of Washington State in Puget Sound.  Agate Beach is a small county park that is popular with kayakers and for bicyclist as a jumping off point for tours of the island.  <br/>
<br/>
Lopez is third largest island in the San Juans but is still sparsely populated.  A laid back attitude prevails here with the residents and visitors alike.  Most people are pleasantly surprised to experience the Lopez Wave where every motorist, bicyclist, and pedestrian alike waves at you as you pass them by.  This is a throwback to earlier times when visitors were rare and the sheep and cattle greatly outnumbered the residents on this agrarian island.  <br/>
