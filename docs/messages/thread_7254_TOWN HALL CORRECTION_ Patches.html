<br/>
I just spoke with Andrea at Town Hall Embroidery (really the embroidery shop in Town Hall Archery).<br/>
<br/>
She was very nice.  She said she would NOT like to take individual orders for the LBNA patches anymore.  The one time was way too hectic and too much trouble to keep track of.  <br/>
<br/>
Please send your orders for the LBNA logo patches directly to me UNLESS you would like to order 50 yourself ....you are welcome to that as often as you wish.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for any confusion that has been caused ... everyone has a bad day, especially when you are working in retail.   :o)<br/>
<br/>
The merit badge orders and the decal orders should be sent directly to the distributors.  <br/>
<br/>
Please go to this site before making any orders:   <a href="http://hometown.aol.com/mohmers/myhomepage/business.html">LbNA regalia updates</a> <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
