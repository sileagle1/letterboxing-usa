                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just posted a new letterbox for Springfield, MA on the CT River <br/>
Bikeway and should hopefully post my second Letterbox called Neponset <br/>
Trail/Dorchester Bay-JFK in South Boston on Sunday. I also added a <br/>
map to my 17 Mile Drive Letterbox from Pacific Grove, CA and finally <br/>
I've updated my Dendrology 101 Letterbox in Storrs, CT just in time <br/>
for the upcoming semester. The box is in the same location, but the <br/>
campus bike tour I designed has been changed to reflect all the new <br/>
additions to campus that have occured over the past year, including <br/>
the opening of the renovated student union and the just started <br/>
construction on the other half.<br/>
