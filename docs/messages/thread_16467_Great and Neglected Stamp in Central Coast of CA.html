<br/>
JugglerMouse and I went out today to look, again in JM's case, for <br/>
the Heron and the Rock. We found it. The book was full so we left <br/>
another small log for signins. The stamp is by Ron and is up to his <br/>
usual great sense of design and style. Walk was easy although a tad <br/>
uphill (not a Ryan box, honest) and the view is spectacular. Most of <br/>
the stamps were from out-of-towners. GSD and Furies may want to check <br/>
this one out. If you do not have this stamp, go for it!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Ron's paces are single ones but I think he has long legs. 'nuff <br/>
said.<br/>
