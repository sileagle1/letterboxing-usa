I like www.d2hosting.com for price and service. About images... Make sure they are .jpg images, then reduce the image size, and if you still want to squeeze the size you can lower the image quality by increasing the compression.<br/>

  For those of you who have your own letterbox sites, are you using a <br/>

  chronicle all of our finds and include pictures, we are fast running <br/>

<br/>
You might look at Netfirms.com. Their personal plan is $4.95 a month and <br/>
includes 250mb of space, and I've used them for years for several sites.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Hints on how to reduce the file size of our pictures without<br/>
&gt;impacting the site's quality would also be helpful!<br/>
<br/>
Just about any graphics program can help you resize a photo and then save <br/>
it in the compressed JPEG format and thus balance image quality with file <br/>
size. For starters, you should try simply sizing the photos on your site to <br/>
the actual size at which they will be displayed. On your Boston Tea Party <br/>
page, for instance, I looked at the photo of the Bunker Hill Monument and <br/>
saw that the image is actually 1200 x 1600, but is displayed at 300x 400. <br/>
If you saved the image at 300x400, the file size would be much smaller than <br/>
359kb. If you crop the photos, as well, you can also reduce the image size.<br/>
<br/>
 From there, when you save it as a JPEG, you can select the level of <br/>
compression in the file. At 1.00, the file is only minimally compressed, <br/>
with a larger file size but higher quality. After resizing your original <br/>
image with no compression, the file size dropped down to 80kb. When you <br/>
compare that file to the image as it's displayed on your site, you can see <br/>
a difference, but it's largely due to the browser doing the resizing of the <br/>
image and the quality is fairly comparable.<br/>
<br/>
As you increase the compression level, the file size can drop quite a bit. <br/>
At 0.85, the file size gets down to 22kb or so, but you can see some <br/>
"splotchiness" particularly around the datestamp text. Otherwise the file <br/>
might be acceptable for web site viewing. You can play around with the <br/>
compression levels between 0.85 and 1.00 and get the right balance of <br/>
quality and file size that works for you.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had a good recommendation for a user-friendly and inexpensive <br/>
graphics program; I've been using The GIMP for Windows, an open source <br/>
graphics editing programing that's pretty powerful but also pretty clunky. <br/>
But since it's free, it works for me.<br/>
<br/>
Ignite (http://www.ignite-it.co.uk/) might be another program to take a <br/>
look at for simple graphics file optimization.<br/>
