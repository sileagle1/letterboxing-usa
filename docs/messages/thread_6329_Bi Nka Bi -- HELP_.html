                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK...somehow we had no problem finding Sankova in Fredericksburg, but <br/>
could not locate Bi Nka Bi.  The last entry in Sankova before us <br/>
indicated that they had difficulty also, but apparently had found it.  <br/>
We would like to search again, but we didn't find it because some <br/>
directions are too vague.  Are we supposed to go up the stairs that <br/>
lead to the water or not?  Directions led us to believe that we were <br/>
to cross the water BEFORE this, but nada.  Please give us an <br/>
additional clue.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
