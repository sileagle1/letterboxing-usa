I sent this note off list, but it came back as undeliverable, so now <br/>
I'm resorting to sending it to the whole list.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to bring you up to date on the whereabouts of your HH.  <br/>
Psychomommy posted that Mark in GA mailed it to her.  I agree with <br/>
what she said in the note -- this is such a nice box and wonderful <br/>
stamp that I'd feel terrible leaving it out in the woods somewhere.  <br/>
So we've taken to handing it around to letterboxers we know.  I guess <br/>
when we run out of local people, someone will leave it in a box.  <br/>
It's moving pretty fast now - 3 places in a week.  It sat at Stone <br/>
Mountain for almost 6 months.  <br/>
<br/>
Psychomommy handed it off to Firefly sometime after 10/12.  Firefly <br/>
gave it to me on 10/18.  I'm giving it to Poison Ivy today.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a lovely stamp.  <br/>

stuff and now Tae Kwon Do five or six times a week after school.  You should <br/>
hear Madeleine yell "EEEEEAAAAAAA!"  Yup, she's the best yeller they've <br/>
got!!<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping once Halloween is through and this charity event I am working on <br/>
is over, that we will have more time for boxing.  As it is now, it seems <br/>
that we only have time when we are away!!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you are having more luck than we are!  Take care!  Nancy<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks so much for the update.  We are very happy to hear that it is <br/>
starting to get around now.  We would kind of like to have it make <br/>
its way back to Wa to the Dancing at Bougival Letterbox by Valentines <br/>
Day next year as this is where it all started.  <br/>
<br/>
By the way, could you pass along a request from us Nails?  The email <br/>
address listed in the log book is no longer active.  Could you or <br/>
whoever has the box at this time change the contact email address in <br/>
the log book to the7nails @ yahoo . com .   This will ensure that we <br/>
are able to keep tabs on its whereabouts.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again and I hope you are enjoying the dance as much as we are.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank-you to Seeker of Flags and Reporter at Large for delivering the Dancing at Bougival HH to me from Mary of Va! It's a touching poem and very nice stamp Nails &amp; I love the 'box'! I couldn't bring myself to stamp it with black ink and cover all the color that had been used to stamp it previously...So, I made a special trip to the store for some markers. It was the first time I had used markers to color a stamp and was very impressed with the color saturation (I hadn't expected it to come out so crisp &amp; dark). I still used colored pencils to enhance the nice image a bit further (colored in her dress) :-)-old habits are hard to break. I will be taking it to our F-100 gathering this weekend and it will go home with the letterboxer that is most likely to meet with another letterboxer soon (or it will have to go in the mail). The box is too nice to leave it out in the woods. I made an additional log book for it too, since the first will be nearly full after the gather (both fit easily in the box with the stamp).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
