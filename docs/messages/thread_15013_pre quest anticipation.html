                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi group,<br/>
I stumbled onto letterboxing by accident over the net.  Wow, what a sport!  There seems to be something for everyone here.  I have not yet gone out boxing as I have to make my personal stamp first, but I have already created two letterbox stamps to place.  The personal stamp is what is holding me back - I feel that so many different things are in my personality. How do I represent me in just the space of a couple square inches?  <br/>
<br/>
I am no artist, but I know when I set my mind to it, I can do it. If only my carved artwork meant to be a tree will be interpreted as a tree.  As with other things, I'm sure my carving abilities will improve in time.  I'm proud of my first two attempts and feel they would be worthy additions to any log book, crude as they are.<br/>
<br/>
My main attraction so far is the historical back story or commentary on the subject of the stamp or letterbox location - that is left before the clues in the LbNA database.  This commentary is the main thing that attracts me most about the sport.  I get a small glimpse of history or commemoration of an event that was important to the placer of the letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
I would encourage everyone to make the back story for every stamp and place it in the database or at least left with the hitchhiker or mystery stamp at their respective locations.  What a way to continue education in small doses - great for us with little attention span, and great for kids of all ages.<br/>
<br/>
As for the stamps - my vote is for hand carved or at least an original conception and commissioned.<br/>
<br/>
Questions for anyone who cares to infom me:  <br/>
<br/>
1. Do I carve two of everything in case *gasp* a stamp goes missing?  Or do I keep a copy of original stamping and try to re-create it (with better ability) later on.<br/>
<br/>
2.  If a stamp goes missing should the letterbox die and be deleted from database?<br/>

I agree that having some story to go with the stamp adds to its <br/>
flavor and the savoring of it later. Sometimes the place itself is <br/>
enough; sometimes the location has that information posted around <br/>
it. More and more I enjoy not just finding the box but looking at <br/>
the view.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; 1. Do I carve two of everything in case *gasp* a stamp goes <br/>

I doubt that we would get many boxes planted if we carved two of <br/>
everything. Keep an image of the stamp. You can then recreate it <br/>
with a photocopy ironned onto or a tracing paper copy rubbed onto <br/>
your carving material if need should arise.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.  If a stamp goes missing should the letterbox die and be<br/>
 &gt; deleted from database?<br/>
<br/>
We have been debating the restoration of boxes. I think it is up to <br/>
the owner. I know that if I will recarve a couple of my boxes gone <br/>
missing,  I leave the clues up and reported missing. If the box was <br/>
distant from me, not a great carve, or just I do not feel like <br/>
recarving it, it probably will have its clues yanked.<br/>

I know several people who have re-carved the same image if and when the box <br/>
goes missing...though sometimes a new/different/better(?) image is carved and <br/>
the box is reborn. In this case it may entice people to re-visit the box to get <br/>
the new stamp.<br/>
<br/>
If a box goes missing it is entirely up to the placer if the box is 'retired' <br/>
and not replaced or if it does get replaced. Again, it is a case of whatever <br/>
pleases you, the placer. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing<br/>
