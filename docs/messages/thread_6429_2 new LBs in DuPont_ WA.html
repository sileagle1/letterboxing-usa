                    <div class="plaintext-content">No problem, Glenn.  This was a lot of fun &amp; quite a departure from <br/>
my normal daily activities.  The mosquitoes aren't so 'vicious' at <br/>
other times of the day (dawn &amp; dusk seem to be the 'killer' times).  <br/>
I have MANY ideas for more in this area, a couple more historic ones-<br/>
-just need some time to scout the areas, figure out what's up with <br/>
some construction projects in the vicinity and to create the <br/>
stamps.  We caged the Hummingbird and set the Eagle free yesterday.  <br/>
That was pretty cool, too!  I visited Titlow Park for the first time <br/>
a couple of months ago and thought I'd seen everything back then--<br/>
boy, was I sure wrong!  What a nice escapade on a hot summer day &amp; a <br/>
great view of the bridge!!!  The 3-1/2 year old made it no problem, <br/>
the 8 month old got a little tired along the way--so Mom got to <br/>
carry an additional 20+ lbs in the backpack!  See you on the trail...<br/>
