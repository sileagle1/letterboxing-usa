as the placer? I don't know ... I logged in with her information and <br/>
checked the member services area and this box is not listed as planted <br/>
by her. But if you click the name of the placer Amy R. (my wifes <br/>
maiden name) you send messages to her email. If someone has a second <br/>
check this glitch out ... I would be curious to know what happened. :)<br/>

Somehow Amy's account was marked as the "maintainer" of <br/>
that  letterbox, as if she'd adopted it. I've set the <br/>
maintainer back to the same as the owner so that she won't <br/>
get any more e-mails from that letterbox.<br/>
