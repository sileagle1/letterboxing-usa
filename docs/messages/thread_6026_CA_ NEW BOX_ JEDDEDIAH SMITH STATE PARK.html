box name: California Redwoods<br/>
location: Jeddediah Smith State Park, California<br/>
County: ? (again, sorry, not from here)<br/>
hike: very easy, good for kids<br/>
directions: relatively easy<br/>
cautions:  Poison Oak is around here -- be CAREFUL.<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:<br/>
 From highway 101 either N or S, take the exit for 199 East to Grant's <br/>
Pass.  It's 9 miles east of Crescent City, on the left-hand side of the <br/>
road.<br/>
<br/>
BOX CLUES:<br/>
Find the visitor's center.  Follow the signs or ask at the gate.  (There <br/>
is a day-use fee of $2, and it's worth it.  This is a great, relatively <br/>
lesser-known park in the redwoods.)<br/>
<br/>
Park across the road next to the bathrooms. (they'll be on your left.) <br/>
Follow the path AROUND the bathrooms to the northeast, and find a sign <br/>
that leads to the nature trail.<br/>
<br/>
Go along the nature trail.  There are some beautiful views of the river, <br/>
and some places to veer off and go to the beach if you'd like to be <br/>
sidetracked.  To find the box, stay straight when you can turn.<br/>
<br/>
When you get to the short post marked with an "8", turn right and go to <br/>
the end of the straightaway, where the path turns left.  Turn around and <br/>
go back the way you came for 8 steps or so, until you're between two <br/>
halves of a fallen log that was cut away to let people walk through.  On <br/>
the side furthest from the river, on the left side of the path, under <br/>
the log is the box!<br/>
<br/>
While you're here, don't miss the summer bridge, which they build fresh <br/>
every year.  It's only a half-mile walk to Stout Grove, which is an <br/>
impressive stand of old-growth redwoods that makes you feel very tiny <br/>
indeed.  (They were building the bridge the day we were there, or the <br/>
box would be in Stout Grove, in fact. :&gt;)<br/>
