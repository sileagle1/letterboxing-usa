16800 River Rd<br/>
Poolesville, MD<br/>
Montgomery County<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:  This is a VERY easy "drive-by" kinda box!<br/>
<br/>
The Seneca School House is open on Sundays from noon  to 4:00 p.m.  You can get the box any day of the week, but if you want to check out the school - Sunday is your day!<br/>
<br/>
Park in front building.  There is a stone wall and a gate.  If the gate is closed, look to the left and you will see an opening in the stone wall where you can walk through.  At the back of the school, you will find a small path lined with wooden boards.  From the end of the path, count 13 steps.  Look to your left and you will see a big dead tree lying on its side.  Hidden inside the hollow end of this log, you shall find what you seek.  Please be careful when sticking your hand into dark places!<br/>
<br/>
After finding the Seneca School House box, you may want to continue down River Road to find Squirrel's Hughes Hollow box.  Just be VERY VERY CAREFUL during hunting season!  (Hunters shouldn't be an issue near the school.)<br/>
