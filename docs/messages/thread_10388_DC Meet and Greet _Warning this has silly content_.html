                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dear Readers,<br/>
The DC Meet and Greet! Was that fun or what?<br/>
<br/>
The fabulous friendly firefly (say that 5 times) was early to great everyone. First one to reach 100 in 6 months or less. Does she have a life? Thanks goodness letterboxing is part of it. The gathering was a total success. Thank you so much. Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow to gatherings we will go.<br/>
<br/>
ADG #1 Tammy sent everyone scurrying for the onsite letterbox  with the “Pick the Dickens” (that’s an x-rated loonerism for sure). That’s our gal. But what can you expect for a  boxer gone mad or is that bad?<br/>
<br/>
In hot pursuit for the box NewB1 was standing on the couch like a linebacker holding the spot until finally someone snuck by him to rehide the box. Nothing was going to get by him. <br/>
<br/>
D&amp;Shoe were there in their finest. D, the letterboxing encyclopedia had a traveler he was promoting and a new ink faced look. You got to admire a guy who really gets into his hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Rumor has it that D and Princess Turtle could be an item some day. The Princess replied “NOT!” to the circulating rumor.<br/>
<br/>
Psychomommy can in with hugs all around. That’s what mommies do best. She had the controversial 2 sided Hitchhiker stamp to share. Your gonna love this one RRR. Mommy’s assets were painfully funny as promised. We don’t call her psycho for nutten.<br/>
Ya gotta love this hobby, don’t ya.<br/>
<br/>
The event stamp was made by the master (mistress) herself. ADG#3 Has Sarah has raised the bar for quality of stamps and booklets or what? Beautiful work from a beautiful woman. <br/>
<br/>
The legendary Squirrel was there with her bag of replacement boxes. Look for replacements coming soon. She was carrying her new traveler and was anxious to share. “Got traveler?” and it’s yours.<br/>
<br/>
The guy from CT made a late but welcome entrance. We wowed his socks off. His parting words were “I’ve go so many stories to tell back home.” Seeds were planted for a meet in Del. with New England and Mid-Atlantic boxers. He had a Hitchhiker to hide so we all trotted out to the closest box and free it there. He said, “Shall we break the rules and stamp it al at once” and we shouted “We have not rules”.<br/>
<br/>
Celtic Pride came out with the official LB North West stamp. Thanks, it is always good to have family join in. The stamp will be sent to the next meet and greet.<br/>
<br/>
Elvis entered the building with John in tow. Glad they could make it. Elvis was last seen crawling under the table looking for his stamp. What a cutie.<br/>
<br/>
The woodsman was there along with a couple of friends. He definitely looks the part.<br/>
<br/>
Mary from Virginia and Schizokeet treated us with cupcakes in celebration of their 100th find that morning. We’ll have to give out golden box awards for the most placed and 100f patches at the next gathering if this keeps up. Well done.<br/>
<br/>
The forest frog family came with big brother. Nice to have some respectability in the group.<br/>
<br/>
Flaming Feather Goddess was a new addition with her beautiful stamp. Go against the flow, was that stamp fishy or what?  Ruth from Germantown was there to take on the Sugarloaf replacement box. Keep your eyes open for clues from on high.<br/>
<br/>
A weehedghog and the BJ’s stamped in and added their smiles to the event. The tortoise and the hare were there as well. Did he really propose to her with a stamp carved “Will you marry me?” Wait till the Smithsonian hears about that!!!<br/>
<br/>
Trekker Jo hiked in for the event and was given squirrels full name when asked “are those you’re real initials” Nothing gets by Trekker. By summer I bet Trekker Jo will know who built those penthouse nests overlooking the lake.<br/>
<br/>
Hope no one was offended, none was intended. May there be lots of nuts in your life,<br/>
Squirrel<br/>

Only my Dad's 90th birthday with siblings from out of town could keep <br/>

one?<br/>
