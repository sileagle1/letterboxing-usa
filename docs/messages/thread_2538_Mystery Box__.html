Well it is a mystery to us...<br/>
Today Muk-Luk and Lockmaster along with myself went to the mystery location <br/>
of Waterfall Walk in Luzerne County, PA.<br/>
Great day, great location,and wonderful company!! No Box....<br/>
2 hrs. there, 4hrs. hiking, 2hrs. back.<br/>
We took compass readings once, twice, ok, eleven or twelve times. We went <br/>
up, over, through, around, and then down to take compass readings again, and <br/>
again. We checked, double checked and had each other check the clues. <br/>
Mul-Luk read them, Lockmaster read them to us and I read them to them.<br/>
We did every thing wrong, right and in between...no box.<br/>
Any 'boxer in the past year, ok, make that ever locate that box?<br/>
I know, I know, you do not always come home with the stamp image in your <br/>
logbook.....sigh....<br/>
Hope your 'boxing weekend was "stampful"!!<br/>
<br/>
See Joy<br/>
