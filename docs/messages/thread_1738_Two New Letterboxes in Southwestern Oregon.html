<br/>
Douglas County, Oregon Letterboxes were placed by Ken, Lori, <br/>
Brittany and Amanda (The Paisley Orca) in Glide, Oregon on 1/13/2001<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Colliding Rivers<br/>
Directions:  From Roseburg, Oregon go East on Hwy 138 for 17 miles.  <br/>
You will see a sign luring you to the Colliding Rivers Boat Launch.  <br/>
Don't take that one.  Go up the hwy just a bit farther and follow the <br/>
sign for the Colliding Rivers Viewpoint, just up the highway a little <br/>
farther. Take a left on Glide Loop Rd. and then an immediate left <br/>
into the parking lot for the viewpoint.  <br/>
<br/>
At Colliding Rivers Viewpoint, the swift, deep waters of the North <br/>
Umpqua River funnel into a water chute and meet the rapids of <br/>
sparkling Little River head-on. The viewpoint includes a rest area <br/>
and comfort station.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Easy to Moderate<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:  Moderate to Difficult.  The distance isn't all that <br/>
much, but the terrain getting to the box can be challenging.  You <br/>
must cross the bridge on a fairly busy highway and go down beneath <br/>
the bridge on the other side, and scramble/climb among and on mossy <br/>
rocks.  This area appears to have potential as an underage drinking <br/>
high-use area in the summer months, I imagine, based on what litter <br/>
has been left.  No one else was present while we were there, though.  <br/>
Dress for wet and dirty and rock scrambling.   Boots with good <br/>
traction are a must.  Poison Oak can be a prominent life form in <br/>
Douglas County, so be mindful of that, as well.<br/>
<br/>
Douglas County Letter Box #1: COLLIDING RIVERS<br/>
Park in the viewpoint area and take a nice look at the rivers coming <br/>
together here.  Go up to the highway (stay on the side you're on you <br/>
want to cross the river, not the highway) and cross over the bridge <br/>
to the other side.  Where you see the "Adopt-A-Highway" sign go over <br/>
the guardrail and follow the trail down under the bridge.  About <br/>
halfway down to the next bridge support (concrete wall) there will be <br/>
a flat concrete slab with a chunk of rebar sticking out of it on your <br/>
left.  Stand on this slab facing the river and look to 9:00 O'Clock. <br/>
You'll see a good size fir tree.  Not far below it, to the right, is <br/>
a "junior" fir.  At the very base of this tree there is large rock to <br/>
the right.  A brown, sandy stone is at the entrance of the crevice <br/>
where this letterbox resides.<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Wolf Creek Falls<br/>
Directions:  In your vehicle, from your parking spot at Colliding <br/>
Rivers, go back up to the highway, cross the bridge and take the <br/>
first left on the other side of the river (Little River Rd.)  Follow <br/>
this for 10.7 miles to the Wolf Creek Falls Trailhead (at arched foot-<br/>
bridge). Along the way down this road, you will see the Cavitt Creek <br/>
Covered Bridge on your right.  The hike begins at the Wolf Creek <br/>
Falls trailhead.  There is a sign on your right, and you'll see the <br/>
arched foot-bridge over Little River. <br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: This trail isn't too tough.  You will go over several <br/>
bridges and there are various ups and downs. It is not considered <br/>
disabled accessible because of the slope over the arched bridge of <br/>
13%. The trail can be moderately steep in some areas, but it is well <br/>
groomed by youth from the nearby Wolf Creek Job Corps. A parking <br/>
area, vault toilet and picnic table are located across Little River <br/>
road from the foot-bridge.  <br/>
<br/>
Wolf Creek Falls Trail is secluded in a tranquil forest setting. The <br/>
1.2-mile trail leads to twin waterfalls tumbling over rock cliffs <br/>
which drop 50 and 75 feet into pools below. Water volume varies from <br/>
a full-fan waterfall in the wet spring to a narrowed spout in the <br/>
summer. In April and May, vegetation is lush and verdant. In the late <br/>
fall and through the winter months rains increase water flow again <br/>
and one must be prepared for a colder and damper hike.  This is a <br/>
most enjoyable hike anytime of year. Dress for the possibility of <br/>
rain.  You shouldn't have trouble with Poison Oak on this trail <br/>
unless you go where you shouldn't. <br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Easy<br/>
<br/>
Douglas County Letter Box #2: WOLF CREEK FALLS<br/>
Park in the area on the right-hand side of Little River Road at the <br/>
trailhead.  Go over the arched bridge and continue on.  After the <br/>
small bridge look to your left.  Frankenstone watches over in solemn <br/>
silence as you pass by.  This is a very pretty trail within a <br/>
beautiful wooded area.  You meander along the water here and there <br/>
and a sense of peace may overcome you.  Keep going. Continue walking <br/>
past the large rock cliff to your right.  In wet weather this mossy <br/>
giant appears as a green weeping wall.  You'll encounter steepness, <br/>
here and there as you go forward, but it shouldn't be too big of a <br/>
deal and you'll be rewarded at the end with wonderful views of the <br/>
falls.  You'll know you're approaching the falls by the sound and <br/>
there is a wonderful clear view of both falls not far from where the <br/>
letterbox is hidden.  Stop and breathe the clear air deeply into your <br/>
lungs.  Marvel at the sights and sounds of this magnificent <br/>
atmosphere.  When you're ready to go to the end of the trail go on up <br/>
ahead to the start of the cyclone fence.  Stop and turn around facing <br/>
the way you came.  Go back 18 paces and look at the tree towering <br/>
right in front of you on the left hand side.  In the very lower left <br/>
crevice (the one with the stumpy chunk of branch kind of hanging by) <br/>
reach in and up and grasp the letterbox.  This box is right on the <br/>
trail, so you might want to make sure no one sees you when you find <br/>
and return it.  Once you've traded stamp images and written a message <br/>
and put the box back, please go the rest of the way (you're very <br/>
close to the end here) and check the view from the base of the upper <br/>
falls.  You'll be glad you've discovered this special little place.<br/>
