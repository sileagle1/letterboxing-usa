 Gov. George Bush has won.  Not only that but he has won the region in a land <br/>
slide.  Just look at these county by county results:   <a <br="">
HREF="http://www.usatoday.com/news/vote2000/cbc/map.htm"&gt;County-by-county</a> <br/>
   Did you see the little blue areas?  Those were the only counties that Gore <br/>
carried ... they were, however, very densely populated counties.  That was <br/>
one reason our very wise founding fathers deliberately set up the electoral <br/>
college...so that New York did not elect the president of our Nation every <br/>
four years.  Of course, some people (like Hillary Clinton as she has clearly <br/>
stated) would like nothing better than to eliminate the electoral college and <br/>
allow that very thing.  Back to the point....after the Florida Supreme Court <br/>
mandated 12 additional days of vote search or ballot counting to allow the <br/>
partisan politicians to find more votes for their candidate, then the Florida <br/>
Secretary of State was required by Florida law to certify the election <br/>
results and the Governor of Florida was require to send ascertainment of this <br/>
certification and the names of the appointed members of the Electoral college <br/>
to the US Capital.  Once done ... the Florida Victor became Gov. George Bush <br/>
(since the democrats were unable to dredge up enough Gore votes).  It is a <br/>
fact of law.  As far as Florida is concerned  Gov. George Bush is now <br/>
President-Elect George Bush.  See for yourself:    <a <br="">

  If you knew all this you might say, "So What? What can I do?" <br/>
<br/>
 This is what you can do: You can let Gore know that you know he has <br/>
lost....send your own or the attached open letter to Gore then forward it to <br/>
all members of the press and all the members of the Senate and House whose <br/>
addresses you can find...especially to the Democrats.   Then pass this email <br/>
request on to everyone you can.<br/>

  SAMPLE LETTER:<br/>
   Subj:    Mr Gore we know that you know you have lost<br/>
   Date:    12/5/00 11:27:54 AM Pacific Standard Time<br/>

   An Open Letter to<br/>
<br/>
    Mr Vice President Gore,  <br/>
   It is way past time for you to concede.  <br/>
   According to the Florida Supreme Court you were given twelve additional <br/>
days to come up with more votes.  After twelve days the recounts still showed <br/>
Gov. George Bush as the victor.  As directed by the Supreme Court, the <br/>
Secretary of State of Florida certified the election results then, by law, <br/>
the Governor of Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush, was required to submit the names of <br/>
the electors in a certificate of ascertainment to the US capital.   <a <br="">
HREF="http://www.nara.gov/fedreg/elctcoll/2000certa.html#fl"&gt;Electoral <br/>
College-2000 Certificates of ASCERTAINMENT</a> <br/>
   Once done, then Gov. George Bush became the official victor in Florida.  <br/>
The election is over, please concede.<br/>
<br/>
  Sincerely, <br/>
    &gt;&gt; BBB<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 BY THE WAY:  The so-called absentee ballot forgery claims are total <br/>
fabrications.  A registrar of the state has the legal right to help prepare <br/>
the absentee ballot requests forms for individuals who are requesting these <br/>
forms.  This is what was done because the request forms were prepared by the <br/>
republican registrars and a space to fill out required information was left <br/>
off the form. The registrars came into the office to fill in this information <br/>
on all the request forms which were received.  This is perfectly legal and <br/>
followed the requirements and guidelines intended to aid <br/>
 every registered American in the voting process. The allegations that only <br/>
republicans were allowed to do this has no grounds in truth.  <br/>
