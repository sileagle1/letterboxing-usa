letterbox placed. On 6/24/04 I was in the park when I passed two <br/>
ladies by a suv with out of state plates. As I passed I said hello, <br/>
but curiosity got the better of me and I had to turn my bicycle <br/>
around. I had to ask Letterboxing? They both said yes. For me, it was <br/>
a thrill to meet someone looking for one of our boxes. Sharon and <br/>
Dorothy from Bloomsburgh PA. We talked along the trail till they <br/>
found our box. After they stamped the log and their log books I <br/>
invited them to our house so we could exchange our stamps. We shared <br/>
some of our stories. It was a nice per chance meeting<br/>
