Leatherman is naturalisticly hidden and must remain so, as people walk <br/>
&amp; explore right by him all the time. There had been several sign-ins <br/>
by non-letterboxers even so. Thanks Rubaduc for rehiding so well. Even <br/>
Bruce didn't find him right off. :)<br/>

Most of the snow is gone but there are still some slippery spots.<br/>
