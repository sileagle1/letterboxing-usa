On  November 25, 2001 Funhog placed a new letterbox at Bishops Close in<br/>
the City of Portland in Multnomah County, Oregon. This peaceful, private<br/>
garden is open to the public for strolling and quiet contemplation. No<br/>
rowdy sunbathers, frisbee players or picnic goers  are welcome. The<br/>
property is an historic residence designed by John Olmsted in 1914,<br/>
situated on thirteen acres overlooking the Willamette River. When the<br/>
original owner died in 1957, the property was donated to the Episcopal<br/>
Bishop with the proviso that it remain open to the public. Its a<br/>
wonderful place to enjoy a letterbox.<br/>

On  December 3, 2001 Funhog placed the Doyle Owl letterbox at Reed<br/>
College in the City of Portland in Multnomah County, Oregon. This<br/>
letterbox is a tribute to the elusive Doyle Owl. Sometime early in the<br/>
history of Reed College, a group of students temporarily neglected their<br/>
studies and absconded with a large piece of architectural cement in the<br/>
shape of and owl, source unknown.  For the better part of a century,<br/>
this icon has been known to make hasty appearances in unexpected places,<br/>
sometimes by unconventional means and has been the object of intense<br/>
scheming and creative thievery. Once exhibited, it always manages to<br/>
disappear, secreted in an unknown hiding place until its next surprise<br/>
public appearance. The owl has been transported by helicopter, appeared<br/>
in a Tears for Fears video, traveled to San Francisco and been submerged<br/>
in various bodies of water. At any given time the owls location and<br/>
current guardian is generally unknown.<br/>
<br/>
to the Trailhead:<br/>
Park at Reed College in the East Parking Lot located on SE Woodstock<br/>
Boulevard, just east of SE 36th.<br/>
<br/>
to the Letterbox:<br/>
Walk toward the main part of the campus on the sidewalk at the north<br/>
side of the parking lot. You will come to a campus map. Just north of<br/>
the bookstore/dining hall find the rising tiers with a lakefront view.<br/>

On January 26, 2002 Funhog placed the "Ace of Fun" letterbox somewhere <br/>
in the City of Portland, Multnomah County, Oregon.<br/>

Unscramble its name and you will learn the home of this mystery box. It <br/>

McIver State Park near the town of Estacada, Clackamas County, Oregon.  <br/>
McIver Park was the site of the region's largest hippie rock Festival, <br/>
Bullfrog, back during the Summer of Love. Jousting Knights and their <br/>
ladies fair can be spotted on the sweeping lawns of this 952 acre park, <br/>
when the Society for Creative Anachronism stages one of their events <br/>
here. This park is not far from Portland and makes for an easy day trip <br/>
and an enjoyable hike along the Clackamas River, past a Chinook salmon <br/>
hatchery and through the surrounding forests. Allow an hour for <br/>
letterboxing while you're here.<br/>
<br/>
to the trailhead: from Portland, go south on I-205 to the Estacada exit <br/>
#12b. Head east and stay on highway 212 to the small town of Carver. <br/>
Don't blink. The road forks in Carver where you will go right across <br/>
the Clackamas River and follow the signs about ten miles to the park. <br/>
Inside the park (day use fee $3) head for the parking lot for picnic <br/>
area F. Walk back along the entry road past the boat ramp to the <br/>
trailhead marked by three posts.<br/>
<br/>
to the letterbox: This is an equestrian trail so count on mud if it's <br/>
been raining. Stay on the main equestrian trail along the river, up the <br/>
bluff and into the forest. Ignore the numerous smaller trails that veer <br/>
off. When you come to a major four way intersection, take the trail at <br/>
110 degrees magnetic. The next intersection will be a three way and you <br/>
take the path at 270 degrees. If you need a rest, your rustic room is <br/>
just ahead. After you've taken a dozen steps between bands of white, <br/>
continue on the path downhill. At the bottom of the hill the trail will <br/>
meet up with a dirt road. Turn towards the cedars and proceed past <br/>
steely objects white and green. After you have crossed two bridges, <br/>
keep your eyes to the right. Find the nurse with a youngster sprouting <br/>
from her top. The letterbox lives behind the nurse sheltered by a mossy <br/>
door.<br/>

in the hope that Western Bluebirds will call them home. Several <br/>
generations have been raised here. Every year in mid June members of <br/>
The Prescott Bluebird Recovery Project sponsor an event where visitors <br/>
can make bluebird boxes, feed adult bluebirds and even see babies in <br/>
the nest. Come see these brilliant little birds any time and sign into <br/>
the letterbox dedicated to their successful comeback.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: From Portland go South on I-5 to exit 278. Follow the <br/>
signs west to the park. A small day use fee is charged.<br/>
<br/>
To the Letterbox: Park at the Visitor's Center where you can get a map <br/>
of the park. Take the trail that heads downhill to the left of the <br/>
Visitor's Center. Across the road and behind the information kiosk go <br/>
left on the paved bike path. Watch for bluebirds along the fenceline. <br/>
When you reach Montcalm, salute Napoleon and then go due North until <br/>
you reach a riverside trail. Head downstream until you are invited to <br/>
rest in front of a huge V-shaped tree. From this point, go eighteen <br/>
steps at 260 degrees magnetic. The letterbox rests at your feet beneath <br/>
a wooden roof, a shard in a fork as its neighbor. If you continue east <br/>

great for wildlife viewing, an orchard of heritage fruit trees, and a <br/>
touch of sorcery.<br/>
<br/>
to the Trailhead: from Portland head west on Highway 30 to the Sauvie <br/>

trees. Don't bite into an apple. Find the geese under Medusa's spell. <br/>
In the distance you will see a golden square marked with a magic <br/>
number. Add this to the tally of trees and set your compass. Seventy-<br/>
five steps away, the enchanted ring sits in wait upon a metal platter. <br/>
Slip the ring upon your finger and the Hidden Dragon will appear before <br/>

On April 25, 2002 Funhog placed the Sturgeon Lake Letterbox on Sauvie <br/>
Island in Multnomah County, Oregon. When Lewis and Clark came to Sauvie <br/>
Island in 1805 there was a large Native American population living <br/>
here, awesome numbers of migratory birds passed through each year and <br/>
the lakes held sturgeon. The levees and dikes built in the 1940s <br/>
prevented flooding but also cause the lakes to silt up and they could <br/>
no longer support these fish which can live as long as a hundred years. <br/>
Today much of this island is managed as a wildlife refuge. As a result, <br/>
some of the area (including Oak Island Nature Trail) is closed to <br/>
visitors from October to mid April. There is also a small use fee <br/>
charged. Buy your day pass at the market by the bridge.  <br/>
<br/>
to the Trailhead: from Portland head west on Highway 30 to the Sauvie <br/>
Island Bridge. Once across the bridge drive north to Reeder Road. Turn <br/>
right and go about a mile and a half to Oak Island Road. Go left here <br/>
for about three miles where Oak Island Road turns to gravel and then <br/>
leads to the Nature Trail parking area. The trail is about 2 1/2 miles <br/>
long.<br/>
<br/>
to the Letterbox: The loop portion of this trail is approximately <br/>
rectangular. Near one of the corners of the rectangle you will find two <br/>
posts fifteen steps apart, one steel, one wood. Standing at the most <br/>
southerly of the two the letterbox lives at 230 degrees magnetic. It <br/>
has penthouse property with a lakeside view, timber construction and a <br/>
rooftop fern garden. If you are less than five and a half feet tall, <br/>
bring a sky hook or anti-gravity boots.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On April 29, 2002 Funhog placed the Bald Peak Letterbox near Newberg, <br/>
Yamhill County, Oregon. There are spectacular views of both the coast <br/>
range and the Cascades on the drive to this box. Bald Peak State Park <br/>
has quite a few trees so the mountains aren't as visible there as they <br/>
are along the road but is a nice spot for a picnic and a short stroll <br/>
to this letterbox. Go on a clear day.<br/>
<br/>
To the Trailhead: Highway 219 runs north-south between Hillsboro and <br/>
Newberg. Bald Peak Road forms a loop with this road. Go west on Bald <br/>
Peak to the parking lot marked with a State Park sign on the top of the <br/>
mountain. Coming from Hillsboro this will entail keeping right at a Y <br/>
and going left at a stop sign.<br/>
<br/>
To the Letterbox: From your car walk southeast along an avenue of firs. <br/>
Look left until you spot a couple of good places to catch a wave. Don't <br/>
bother to bring your surfboard. With Mount Hood centered between these <br/>
two points, take a compass reading of 235 degrees magnetic and head <br/>
this direction to a dirt trail. At the first Y go right  20 steps. You <br/>
will see a likely home for a letterbox at 310 degrees. The letterbox <br/>
waits down low behind bark.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On July 25, 2002 Funhog placed the Eagle Creek II Letterbox along the Eagle Creek Trail in the Columbia <br/>
River Gorge near the town of Cascade Locks, Hood River County, Oregon. This portion of the trail has an <br/>
elevation gain of less than 500 feet which makes it a relatively easy hike. However, sections are narrow, <br/>
with a breathtaking drop to the river below. This is not the best place to bring small children or people <br/>
queasy about heights. That said, the forest has some spectacular old growth trees and the plethora of <br/>
waterfalls is hard to beat. Allow three hours for the roundtrip. In addition to this letterbox, search for <br/>
Ryan Carpenter's letterbox on the same trail near High Bridge:<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Letterboxing/index.html<br/>
<br/>
To the Trailhead: From Portland go east on I-84 to exit 41. Turn right to the Eagle Creek entrance. There <br/>
are a few spaces right by the trailhead but the majority of parking is by the restrooms as you enter the <br/>
park.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: Head for the waterfall named for a Native American salmon goddess. At the point <br/>
where the main trail intersects with a side path to the fall's viewpoint you will find three logs conveniently <br/>
bolted together. Walk sixteen steps downhill where you will be facing a pair of twins. The letterbox is to <br/>
your right, beneath loose bark.<br/>

Lincoln City, Lincoln County, Oregon. This is an easy, well-maintained, three mile round trip hike in the <br/>
coast range. The forest here is amazing, not for the standing trees but for the remains of the forest <br/>
that once was.  There are stumps, snags and downed logs that are absolutely HUGE. The area was logged <br/>
in 1957 and this will give you an idea of how long it takes for trees to grow to any size. The falls are <br/>
lovely but what is truly wonderful is the vantage point from which you view them. There is a suspension <br/>
bridge over the gorge with a canopy view of the cascade!  <br/>
<br/>
To the Trailhead:  Once off the main highways most of the road to the trail is narrow with short sections <br/>
of gravel.<br/>

the Pelton Dam Wildlife Overlook near the town of  Warm Springs in<br/>
Jefferson County, Oregon. This is a great place to view migratory<br/>
waterfowl as well as their nemesis, the bald eagle. This is a quick<br/>
stop along the highway. The Warm Springs Museum is always a worthwhile<br/>
excursion while you're in the area. Bring binoculars!<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: Going toward Madras on Highway 26, about a mile east<br/>
of the Deschutes River Bridge, take the first road to the right. There<br/>
is a brown directional sign here for the Overlook and Lake Simtustus.<br/>
Go to the next road and turn right again to the parking area for the<br/>
Wildlife Overlook. <br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: Your footsteps will crunch as you sneak to the left.<br/>
Even though the  blind bartender is nowhere in sight, belly up to the<br/>
bar, resisting all temptation to take a seat. There is something fishy<br/>
going on right under your nose. At 104 degrees a shady character<br/>
awaits with a stone-faced partner by his side. This partner works as a<br/>
bodyguard for members of the Plastic Box Gang.<br/>
