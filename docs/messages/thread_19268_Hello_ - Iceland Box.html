Actually, I did plant a box in a thermal area of Iceland...  The <br/>
clues are on the website, but you have to search for the box name <br/>
(the map's not linked yet).  Or, here they are:<br/>
<br/>
Placed: Feb 29 2003<br/>
Nearest City: Grindavik<br/>
Number of Boxes: 1<br/>

The Blue Lagoon is Iceland's most visited tourist attraction. A <br/>
beautiful lagoon in the midst of a field of lava, the color of a <br/>
robin's egg. The minerals in the water are wonderful for your skin. <br/>
The day we were there, the air temperature was only about 3 degrees C <br/>
(about 37 F), but the lagoon was a wonderful 38 C (100 F). It was <br/>
heavenly.<br/>
<br/>
To commemorate our visit to Iceland, I had to place a letterbox, and <br/>
where else but at the Blue Lagoon? This box is very quick, so <br/>
hopefully anyone who manages to visit will be able to get it, and <br/>
still be able to spend plenty of time soaking!<br/>
