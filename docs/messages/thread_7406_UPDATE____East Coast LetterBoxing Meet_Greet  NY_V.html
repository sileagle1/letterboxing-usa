<br/>
My parents are in your area and love your boxes.  They<br/>
haven't gotten into carving, yet, but I hope to bring<br/>
them some supplies when I get up there later this<br/>
month. (and maybe some boxes to plant?)  They also<br/>
have gotten my aunt and uncle interested.  They have<br/>
nabbed the Putnum Pond box, the Scaroon Manor box and<br/>
Ticonderoga boxes this weekend.  They are saving your<br/>
Raquette Lake one for when we arrive.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if they would be interested in a get<br/>
together but I'm sure if I were in the area during the<br/>
time I could convince them and the uncle and aunt to<br/>
tag along! :o)<br/>

Glad they liked the stamp at Putnam....my first, as I sat at our campsite<br/>
across the lake.  More to come at that location when we go up again next<br/>
year....be on the lookout!<br/>
Did they find the Ti box recently?  We looked last fall, our first outing<br/>
letterboxing, and came up with nothing.  But husband is off to fight the<br/>
British? Americans? this weekend at Ti, so I may head up, see him, and look<br/>
for it....-Kittlekatz<br/>

I believe they told me that they found the Ti box this<br/>
last weekend.  I know my kids came home from their<br/>
visit with Grandma and Grandpa the end of June with<br/>
the stamp and if I remember she told me my uncle and<br/>
aunt found it this last weekend.   I know they have<br/>
tried for the Crown Point box on at least three<br/>
occassions--even mapping out the steps on graph<br/>
paper-- but just didn't find it.<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait for your other boxes--of course I still<br/>
need to get my first in NY. :o)<br/>

Wow, had I realised these two boxes were so difficult to find, I would not<br/>
have dragged my friend along to find 'em as her first letterboxing<br/>
experience... although we did have fun marching around the field at Crown<br/>
Point, my friend ended up standing in a patch of stinging nettles :(<br/>
Watch out for spiders and snakes, we found a lot there...<br/>
Kittlekatz... thanks to you, we were able to end the foray on a find at<br/>
Putman Pond. :)<br/>
