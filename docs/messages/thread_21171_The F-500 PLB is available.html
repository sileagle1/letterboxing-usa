If you have found 500 or more letterboxes and would like to get the F-500 PLB, please contact me directly at: DogScouts@hotmail.com with your name and mailing address.<br/>
<br/>
There is no mailing list inside the box, you will need to let me know when you get it and I'll let you know the next address.<br/>
<br/>
It also needs to be sent to the next person within 3 business days with delivery confirmation.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: the F-100 box lists are still temporarily closed but it won't be too much longer before they are open as well.<br/>
