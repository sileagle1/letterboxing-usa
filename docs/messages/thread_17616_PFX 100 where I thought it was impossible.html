so many of my letterboxing heroes, I am excited to say that I <br/>
reached PFX 100 today!  This small milestone represents a lot of <br/>
fun memories for me.  I can't believe how many fun and <br/>
incredible people I have met along the way and how many great <br/>
adventures I've had while I was at it.  Thanks A-bear for your <br/>
encouragement and boxes.  While I'm thrilled to finally have a <br/>
few other boxers here in ID, I have to admit, it's almost a little sad <br/>
to give up our distinction of being the lone "Idaho Girls."  Thanks <br/>
also to the great boxers traveling through who I now count as <br/>
friends such as Don and Gwen, Butterfly in Conn., dvn2r skr, <br/>
Paisley Orca, etc (it's late and I'm sure I'm leaving some out <br/>
since I'm not thinking clearly at the moment).  To qoute (or <br/>
misquote as it may be) Williams, "I rely upon the kindness of <br/>
strangers."<br/>
<br/>
I know that this is still not a huge number to many, but <br/>
considering that there were only two letterboxes that I could find <br/>
within hundreds of miles when I started last March, I'm pretty <br/>
pleased with my numbers and all the fun they represent.  I am <br/>
looking forward to warmer weather so I can get out again (I think <br/>
letterboxing may be a bit easier w/o a foot or two of snow).  On <br/>
the other hand, the bad weather gives me a chance to start <br/>
working on my ideas for planting some new boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I've tried to keep my numbers pretty even--one find for one plant, <br/>
but the recent gatherings in Salt Lake and Boise and the <br/>
subsequent hunting that went along with them blew that average <br/>
for me.  I will have to get carving since I'm a believer in plant it <br/>
and they will come.  I'm working hard on it!<br/>
<br/>
happy hunting,<br/>

Congratulations on your milestone! I think Minnesota is where Idaho <br/>
was, as you describe it, last March. Thanks for the indirect <br/>
encouragement! I've heard the message from several sources <br/>
now, "plant them and they will come" and that's just what I'm going <br/>
to do. <br/>
<br/>
I thought I'd need to wait until warmer weather to get going but our <br/>
area of Minnesota has been rather light on the snow this season and <br/>
it looks like I'll be able to get started earlier. I've got three <br/>
boxes ready to go with a 4th one almost done. Now I just need to find <br/>
the perfect hiding spots. Look for clues coming soon.<br/>

Yo Cadenza<br/>
Congratulations !  Now ,that I had the fun of meeting you in Utah, I<br/>
count you as a wonderful new friend and it is great to know the eleven<br/>
boxes from CT folks are there now to be enjoyed by others.  I hope you<br/>
were able to take some to Id  especially the Elk carved by Chuck  and<br/>
Molly  It sort of wanted to go to Id.!!<br/>
Clues are ready to be posted of the two boxes my grandchildren helped<br/>
me plant on the Jordon River Trail . Sunseeker is helping me via e<br/>
mail to make sure I have the clues right. See has found both boxes and<br/>
reports they are in good order. Happy boxing  <br/>
