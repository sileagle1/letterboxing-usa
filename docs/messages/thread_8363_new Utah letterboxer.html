                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all!  I am very new to this, but was able to get out and hunt <br/>
for one of the few letterboxes near me.  I am happy to report that <br/>
the box on the Deicate Arch Trail is alive and well.  My very first <br/>
find!  It sounds like you have a great group back east and tons of <br/>
boxes.  I have a feeling that I will be planting more that I will be <br/>
finding for awhile, but I can see how I'll be planning my upcoming <br/>
vacations.  Thanks for all the hints and helps that are out there!  <br/>
Can't wait to find more.  Jill  <br/>
