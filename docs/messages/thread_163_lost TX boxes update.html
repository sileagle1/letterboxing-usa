                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks so much for the warm outpouring of sympathy and advice!  Ya'll are<br/>
just spectacular.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I went to check on boxes #1 &amp; #2 (you may remember that both #3 &amp;<br/>
#4 went missing).  Sadly, #1 was completely missing, no trace.  But I did a<br/>
happy dance to find #2 dry and secure and completely all there.<br/>
<br/>
I'm still considering the mystery of the missing boxes.  Three seems too<br/>
many for pure coincidence in some ways, but I don't want to get paranoid.<br/>
I'm still thinking about how I want to proceed.  I left box #2 out there in<br/>
place--I figure if it's lasted this long, it must be ok.<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking I'll scout new locations for 1, 3, &amp; 4--also 5 &amp; 6.<br/>
Clues...what to do with clues?  Haven't really decided.  Even though I<br/>
think it's unlikely that vandals seached the web for malicious ways to do<br/>
mischief, I don't think it's impossible either.  I'd like to make it easy<br/>
for interested people to get clues, but not so easy for others...still<br/>
thinking about how to make that happen.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm taking a deep breath and pulling new boxes together.  I haven't<br/>
decided whether to duplicate the lost stamps exactly (I do have prints from<br/>
them and could have rubber made--or just carve again) or come up with<br/>
something completely different...<br/>
<br/>
LOVE the curse idea and will incorporate some version of it, absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your kind responses,<br/>
Julie<br/>

Got to admit, 3 out of 4 boxes vandalized doesn't look very promising.  I hate<br/>
to say it, but this jerk may very well have used the clues to find your boxes.<br/>
Probably wasn't able to find the one that's still there.<br/>
<br/>
Try not to be discouraged, though.  It would probably be best to move on to<br/>
another area, preferably quite a ways from where this happened.  In time, the<br/>
jerk will forget all about letterboxes, and you can go back and replace the<br/>
originals.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mitch<br/>
