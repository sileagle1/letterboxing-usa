Way to go. You are going to be great at this.<br/>
<br/>
A few small pointers:<br/>
<br/>
No need to do the Alexandria updates. Alexandria falls within the map <br/>
borders ries of Metro DC, which we have arbitrarily put with MD <br/>
rather than VA. John De Wolf will usually update these - even those <br/>
locations that happen to fall in VA rather than MD. I have updated <br/>
those MD boxes this morning.<br/>
<br/>
We are talking about scrapping the showing of boxes on neighboring <br/>
states, and instead putting a large dot with the state initials in <br/>
each neighboring state, and being able to jump to that state map <br/>
immediately. So I would not take the time now to try updating VA to <br/>
show new MD boxes. (Washington DC may be an exception to this <br/>
approach?)<br/>
<br/>
There is a problem with the hometown aol links - they grab the top <br/>
banner and make it impossible to use your back button. If you try <br/>
this with Sheperdstown, you will see what I mean. What you want to do <br/>
is link to<br/>
<br/>
http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/twograysquirrels/page5.html<br/>
<br/>
instead of <br/>
<br/>
http://hometown.aol.com/twograysquirrels/page5.html<br/>
<br/>
Use this pattern whenever you come across someone with a hometown <br/>
page at aol.com<br/>
<br/>
I think the font you used for Sheperdstown is close, but that we <br/>
really all should use the same Tiger font. IMO, it really looks <br/>
better to have this consistency. Just copy the URL address in the <br/>
text file I sent to you into your browser's address window. Save the <br/>
resulting gif, and copy/paste the new label onto your va.gif  map.<br/>
<br/>
I'll send you another text file with Sheperdstown right in place.<br/>

&gt; Check out WV. I just updated it with the Shepherdstown boxes. I think I have it correct but please check it out since it was my first attempt at updating the map, text and links..  I am going to do V&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tom    Does the text look ok? I ended up using MS Paint and the standard Arial font which looks pretty close to me. Couldn't figure out the text info you sent me.<br/>
