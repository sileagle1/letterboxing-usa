<br/>
I kicked off the New Year at the Hoof 'N Holler in Albany, Oregon. What a show! An old west town, saloons, a mine, jailhouse, dancing, and bull riding at its best. Clint Johnson, stayed on his bull for the 8 seconds and then romantically proposed to his girl in front of the whole crowd. If you ask me, she couldn't say no if she wanted to. <br/>

The Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area is one of the most outstanding scenic areas in America. The best way to enjoy the land is to get out of your car and hike it. Nice weather tends to bring out the crowds, so come on a weekday if you can. If you have time on your hands, I highly recommend the Columbia Gorge Trail. If nothing else, take your car along the 65-mile scenic drive. You won't regret it. <br/>

Portland has not always been the beautiful city it advertises itself to be; from 1850-1941 it was known as the "Forbidden City." You could be sitting in a tavern, minding your own business, drinking your tequila, and the next thing you knew, you were dropped into Portland's underground. Even the best taverns were known to shanghai poor unsuspecting patrons. Recently 150 cub scouts and their fearless leader, Barefoot Lucy, arrived in Portland. They were a little mixed up in the history time frame (happens when the fearless leader has too much tequila) and had come to rescue the unsuspecting patrons from the tunnels. Unfortunately, shirt and shoes were required and they were turned away at the door.  <br/>

Peterson's Rock Garden is a little ways outside of the town of Redmond. This guy, Rasmus Peterson, collected rocks. He finally acquired so many rocks that the next natural step was to build something with them. So build he did. He covered about four-acres in miniature buildings, monuments, and bridges. Talk about too much free time on your hands. My favorite was the Statue of Liberty. Words of great wisdom are on a plaque at the base: "Enjoy Yourself - It Is Later Than You Think."  But, I did not come here to talk about bulls, cars, cub scouts, or bridges; I came to talk letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Oregon has about 1,200 listed traditionals, and about 65 listed mysteries. Am I missing something here? Oregon, as one of the leading letterboxing states in America, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Only about 65 listed mysteries! What Oregon lacks in mysteries they gain in innovativeness. There are some very creative clues. The Pacific Northwest is damp, in fact most of the year it is plain downright wet. A waterproof container is a must. Get one of those cheap jobs and you will be looking at moldy logbooks. Use common sense when hiking in Oregon, or anywhere else for that matter. Don't walk on the edges on cliffs; it is a long fall, and your chance of survival is not that great. Be careful when walking on rocks, especially after a rain. If I have to tell you why, then you should not be out. <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
