                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
My kids and I are carving some boxes for the Mansfield Monster Mash<br/>
and we would really like it if we could have a record of the other<br/>
monster letterboxes that are  placed there. Is anyone planning on<br/>
going and getting lots of stamps, and our logbook[s] could hitchhike<br/>
along????????<br/>
Just in case anyone is wondering what this is all about and did not<br/>
read the previous post about the Mash, the web site is at: <br/>
<br/>

It is a pretty cool thing, check it out!<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Dude.<br/>
<br/>
Are you serious?<br/>
<br/>
Last time I checked a true find was when you actually stamped the letterbox stamp <br/>
into your own logbook - not helping somebody else out. Hey, while you're at it, why <br/>
don't you just scan in those stamps and let people print them out with the clues. Who <br/>
needs the walk? Better yet, just bring my logbook with you to the Monster Mash. <br/>
Thanks so much - it would be ever so apprectiated.<br/>

<br/>
   I thought I would step out of the "quietly reading" mode to <br/>
respond to this.  I have actually been thinking about this for days, <br/>
since the original post requesting that the log book be taken <br/>
along.  It brought to mind the question on the questionnaire that <br/>
the girl (sorry to have forgotten her name) was doing for her school <br/>
paper.  She wanted to know if we felt letterboxing was a sport or a <br/>
hobby. <br/>
<br/>
    When it comes to logbook tag-a-long, it depends on which side of <br/>
the line you fall on: sport or hobby.  If you are on the "sport" <br/>
side and see letterboxing as a who gets what first/ who gets how <br/>
many/ who goes the farthest/ who wears better hiking boots, has <br/>
better compass, and carries a heavier backpack... well, it's sort of <br/>
shocking that all of your efforts to "win" are in vain.  No one <br/>
can "win" at letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
    But, at the same time, there is a lot of emphasis on honesty <br/>
here.  Everyone knows it would be easy to lie about finds or plants, <br/>
and the fact that it is so easy takes away from the "sport" <br/>
possibilities.  Still, honesty is important no matter what your <br/>
reason for letterboxing.  So, it is upsetting to think someone is <br/>
going to claim to have "found" something which they did not find.<br/>
<br/>
    I must admit, that I would love to see those Monster stamps, <br/>
too.  I've submitted a couple of boxes that I am proud of.  But, I <br/>
have two small kids and can't make the 14 hour drive.  So, I also <br/>
understand how it is to contribute to something that you can't <br/>
participate in and want to know "how it went".<br/>
<br/>
    But, for myself, I believe that I should have what I find and <br/>
stamp with my own little fingers.  FOR MYSELF, I stress. <br/>
<br/>
    I see both sides here.  And ultimately, my final opinion is that <br/>
there are no (and can be no) rules here.  There can be no rules <br/>
because there is no game.  The only basic "rules" apply equally to <br/>
life in general: do what you will and harm none.<br/>
<br/>
     Maybe one day Ill look through a fellow boxers log and they <br/>
can show me a few of those monster stamps. (If they dont mind <br/>
showing them off.) <br/>

understand someone making a contribution (stamp) and wanting to see <br/>
what others have done.  NOT as finds, just as art appreciation.  You <br/>
don't have to own the painting to appreciate it.  And if there really <br/>
are 100+ stamps sent, what a nice little 'publication' that could <br/>
be!  Maybe Chuck&amp;Molly and the other host/hostesses (and shame on me <br/>
for not remembering which LB'rs they are) would consider such a <br/>
scanning feat to help defray the costs of 'returning' the stamps -- <br/>
hey did any of you contributors include a check for return postage?<br/>
<br/>
In fact, now that I have moved out of my glass house, I'll toss a few <br/>
pebbles.  (i.e. I took my 4 stamps to the PO Sun - love that click-n-<br/>
ship) Why aren't there more Red Stars by contributors names showing <br/>
they have sent in their stamps (Chuck please hurry and post Red Stars <br/>
by my name).  Can you imagine having to hide 100+ stamps in 30-<br/>
days!!!!  I hope folks didn't think that "by Sept 1" meant they were <br/>
going to run to the PO on Sept 1.  Please make these your #1 priority <br/>
for carving and mailing.<br/>

This has not been a paid announcement . . . I'm on my own with this <br/>
one.<br/>

Perfectly said!  And oh, so true.<br/>
And one of these days, (after the Mansfield Monster Mash) I'd be happy to let you browse through my logbook and appreciate what I'm sure will be some awsome Monster Mash stamps!<br/>

And ultimately, my final opinion is that <br/>
there are no (and can be no) rules here.  There can be no rules <br/>
because there is no game.  The only basic "rules" apply equally to <br/>
life in general: do what you will and harm none.<br/>
<br/>
     Maybe one day Ill look through a fellow boxers log and they <br/>
can show me a few of those monster stamps. (If they dont mind <br/>
showing them off.) <br/>
