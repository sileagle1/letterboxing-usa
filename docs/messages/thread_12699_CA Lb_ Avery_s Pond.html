                    <div class="plaintext-content">This morning I checked up on this box and found that it is alive and<br/>
well. However, some pinheads toppled the stump that had been its home,<br/>
found the box and made an X-rated entry in the log. The only nice<br/>
thing I can say about them is that they didn't trash the box. <br/>
<br/>
The log has been censored, the clue updated (dontcha just love that<br/>
Wes for setting up the new user friendly database?) and is once again<br/>
suitable for a PG rating. Kudos to those persistent letterboxers who<br/>
managed to find the box in spite of the altered hiding place. It even<br/>
took me a while to find it. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has a yen to see the California foothills at their glorious<br/>
spring best must head for this box, NOW! The wildflowers will take<br/>
your breath away... Funhog<br/>
