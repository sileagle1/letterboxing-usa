Mark from Virginia reminded me of another thing I love about <br/>
letterboxing when he observed that in 14 years he had never been to a <br/>

there. I've experienced the same thing at some places within 30 <br/>
minutes of my front door that I had never been to before. It's <br/>
amazing the cool places in one's own backyard that one can miss. <br/>
