hmmm...I found a box and a hitchhiker when I was out and about this <br/>
weekend and neither of them are listed on atlas quest. I seem to be the <br/>
pro at finding unlisted hitchhikers. In case any of you are the owners-I <br/>
have found Santa Claus is Coming to Town and sent it on its way and I <br/>
have found one called Feather. The unlisted box I found was Squirrel in <br/>
the Mailbox. Now if I could get the owners to list them on Atlas Quest?<br/>

<br/>
Are they listed on Wanda &amp; Pete's site?  If they are, you can email Wanda and <br/>
report who found it, and when and where they found it.  Where they left it <br/>
remains a mystery until the next finder after them places it yet someplace else, <br/>
then goes to Wanda &amp; Pete's site to report where they found it, etc.  <br/>

I don't suppose it was a micro-box (in a white film container) called Long Feather, was it?<br/>
