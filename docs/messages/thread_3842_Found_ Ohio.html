Cincinnati.  "Something's Fishy" was in good shape when my family and <br/>
I went there letterboxing and geocaching yesterday afternoon.  <br/>
<br/>
The thermometer was about 60 degrees and the sun was shining <br/>
brightly.  Wife (Star) son (Sniper) and first timer daughter (Bfly) <br/>
enjoyed the hike in the park.  <br/>
<br/>
Finding a trout in Cincinnati was just an added benni for Flyfisher.<br/>
<br/>
I need to find more boxes!  *more boxes!*  ;D<br/>
