I'm not entirely sure how this works, not having a blender pen myself, <br/>
but I am looking into the various "transfer" options we may want to <br/>
explore to get the best results.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be using the Mastercarve "white" medium, rather than the "pink <br/>
stuff".<br/>
<br/>
Thank you kindly!<br/>

<br/>
You can buy xylene at the hardware store...but the pens I have used for <br/>
transferring are blender pens for colored pencils and they already have xylene in <br/>
them... be sure to check to see that DO have xylene, as not all blender pens <br/>
contain it.<br/>
It should say right on the pen... and be CAREFUL, the flumes are highly <br/>
hazardous to your health - not good at all - if I use them (which I rarely do), I <br/>
use them outside and hold my breath.  The warning on xylene is pretty scary!<br/>
