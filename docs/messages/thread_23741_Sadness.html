Letterboxing is whatever you want it to be, let's say.  If the majority of what is thereby created constitutes a debris field of easy-to-find tupperware containing stamps that flew off a belt in China, so it will be.  What the majority is, or does, in this game doesn't really matter to the game itself if we each create the game's meaning ourselves, and let's say we do.

After all, the majority of people don't 'box at all:  we are a self-determined minority of conspirators with an aim to have some fun under the radar, essentially playing by our own rules.  A game played this way is like a sudden freshet released on the land, in that it will naturally form channels and eddies, and, surely, backwaters.  So, if it's a definitional free-for-all, a flood on the land, His Pungency has pointed out the channel he prefers, as others recently have (admirably, we submit) with respect to mysteries.  As calls to flow in these particular directions, to create boxing experiences beyond the banal, we would wish these messages to be taken to heart.  Remaining true to the original premise, one cannot say there is no place for easy boxes, or for people who can't or won't hike, nor would we wish to in any event. However, it is perfectly fair to urge that those who can create or seek the extrordinary, do so, and help create what letterboxing "is". If this is what P-Bob advocates, we strongly agree.  Some channels of a stream may meander easily and broaden and shoal until they slow and stagnate.  Others, however, may relentlessly press on in their determined course and carve out canyons of wonder.  If Bob's message doesn't interest you, so be it.  We hope it does interest you, however, and spurs on those of you disposed to respond favorably to make the game extraordinary.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have read with interest the "Sadness" chat.  I agree that it is more  <br/>
satisfying to take a long hike and to uncover a box.  I too find this very  <br/>
gratifying but like so many other boxers with young children, it's not possible  for <br/>
me to do long hikes with my 4 and 2 year-old.  My 4 year-old LOVES  walking in <br/>
the woods and helping with me with the clues because I only choose  boxes <br/>
that are appropriate for her ability and interest level.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I personally like doing the longer boxes by myself or with other adults but  <br/>
I just see how much my daughter has benefited from and now has a love for the  <br/>
outdoors and historical spots because of the easier ones.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to the day when I can do the long hikes up mountains with my  <br/>
two kids at my side but we are a few years off and until then really <br/>
appreciate  the different levels of letterboxing  available...GlobeBear.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!!  Now that's not all about SADNESS and DISTRESS about the state of<br/>
letterboxing!  Very nice post!  Maybe His Pungency should have you write for<br/>
him!  ;-)  You obviously read much more positive in his last sentence than<br/>
the sadness and distress about how it ustabe and what it oughtabe that I<br/>
read in the first 3 or 4 paragraphs!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, by all means, challenge each other!  That's been going on all along!<br/>
There are lots of challenging hikes and great scenery, and some of the<br/>
coolest boxes and places aren't generally apparent to the newbe or casual<br/>
boxer; you have to know somebody who lets you "in" on the box.  You can take<br/>
the game to whatever form and level that you wish!  That's wonderful!  But<br/>
it does not require telling other boxers that we've forgotten all about the<br/>
journey and location. Raising your level of boxing does not require putting<br/>
other people's likes and preferences down, and that's what I read in the<br/>
bulk of the first post. ("What I'm 'hearing' is...")  One does not need to<br/>
feel sadness and distress about the way others play the game in order to<br/>
take it to a different level or go off in another direction.<br/>
<br/>
Savvy? Why, yes!  Thanks for the very eloquent post. I'm glad you finished<br/>
your inspiring "rant."<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to add that I don't think there is *any* fighting going on here,<br/>
for my part, just expressing of viewpoints.  My response to PB's post not<br/>
meant to be inflamatory.  I just wanted to express my views on what he<br/>
wrote. I get that "hey, wait a minute..." feeling and just can't help<br/>
myself.<br/>
<br/>
I like it when we all play nice.  :-)<br/>

 I would never have visited dozens of parks and points of interest had it not been for letterboxing. I would never have visited certain parts of Indiana, West Virginia or New York had it not been for the boxes there. I never would have seen the monumentsm statues and the graves of some 'lost' relatives had it not been for boxes.<br/>

 Hiking is great but many of us do not have the time nor are in a position to walk too many miles. While I walk up to 8 miles each and every work day, my diabetic wife cannot do so nor can she tollerate the heat. Everyone can get into the act via drive-bys or handicap accessible of kid friendly.<br/>

I have one lung, COPD, pacemaker/difibrilator and aged 65.  I started out with virtual letterboxes and enjoyed it so much that I thought it would be good to get out of the couch potatoe mode and try to help myself more.  Thus began our hunting for the traditional boxes.  So far we have found 14 boxes, adopted two boxes, planted two boxes and have several more to plant.  My health has improved greatly.  We have the enjoyment of going for our little walks each and every weekend.  A long walk for us may only be a tenth of a mile one way but on some days that is enough.  Like beauty, letterboxing is in the eyes of the beholder.  Pungent Bob doesn't breath for me nor does his heart beat move my blood around.  However, in his defense, he does have the right to express his opinion on the subject the same as we have been expressing ours in response.  So lets give him a break and move on<br/>
 with our own abilities to conquer our own challanges and enjoy the trip.<br/>

diversity of the hobby.  There are boxes available to fit every persons <br/>
liking and capability.  If you love a brain teaser, a long hike, a <br/>
short walk, or straight forward clues there are boxes you can find.  <br/>
That's what makes it such a great hobby.  It doesn't discriminate to <br/>
intelligence, physical capability, or age.  It brings together people <br/>
with a love of nature and outdoors, and makes out inner child happy <br/>
with the sense of mystery and hidden treasure.  It's all a matter of <br/>
taste.  I've hiked 5 miles for a box that was magnificent, and I've <br/>
done a short jaunt for a box that was equally breathtaking.  Every <br/>
person that participates is going to be different.  They will have <br/>
different idea's of what makes for a great box, hiding location, and <br/>
stamp.  As long as that continues, it will hold appeal for the masses <br/>
which is how I feel it should be.  If it gives you happiness and peace <br/>
and relaxation, get out there and box! It doesn't matter which type you <br/>
prefer!!!!  <br/>

&gt; Thank you Weatherglass for your response. I am brand<br/>
&gt; new to the concept and at first was very enthusiastic<br/>
&gt; about beginning my adventure. But when i read some of<br/>
&gt; the clues I felt overwhelmed.Some of us are physically<br/>
&gt; challeneged and cannot take steep hikes or arduous<br/>
&gt; treks. My exercise must sometimes be with my mind. I<br/>
&gt; hoped Letterboxing could include me in that manner.<br/>
&gt; When I read the initial posting of Sadness I felt<br/>
&gt; excluded like I shouldn't even bother to begin. Thanks<br/>
&gt; for encouraging others to allow for all kinds of<br/>
&gt; adventures-- physical AND mental. Justafaze<br/>
