forget to look up the clues for Resolution and The Red Dragon , if you <br/>
have not done those. All the other boxes [and there are ???] are planted <br/>
about and the clues will be at the Clue Table all printed out for you <br/>
along with a map of the park.  The Event Stamp and Log in Book will be <br/>
at a table too. They will be 'watched' over by one of us 'Newbies' so be <br/>
sure to check out that spot. The event stamp and book will not be <br/>
traveling around , with all the other frenzy of stampers.!!!  Does this <br/>
sound as if we know what we are doing ??<br/>
We will also have a food table for you to add to if you wish.  Grills <br/>
are there so make plans to use them if you want  There is no 'Long <br/>
House" so if the Gods decide to show us some weather we hope to put <br/>
tarps up between cars. Any ideas and energy in that direction is welcome.<br/>
We are all getting excited.<br/>
