stamper (greeting cards, etc.) and someone on one of my rubberstamping lists<br/>
brought up the topic of letterboxing.  Imagine my delight when I did a bit<br/>
of research and found that there are many many letterboxes in New England<br/>
and other places we frequent.  I told my husband, Eric, about it and he was<br/>
as intrigued as I, and in fact he spent much of last night carving our<br/>
'personal stamp'.  I think we will go in search of our first letterbox next<br/>
weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Please bear with me as I ask some basic newbie questions, answers of which I<br/>
could not find on the websites so far:<br/>
<br/>
1.  What are the average dimensions of people's stamps - both personal and<br/>
in the boxes?  Would anyone care to share examples of personal stamps (I<br/>
have seen quite a few letterbox stamps).<br/>
<br/>
2.  I saw a directory of pooch-friendly letterboxes, is there something<br/>
simliar for children? (I have a daughter who is 2 and while she loves the<br/>
outdoors, we are obviously limited in lenght of hike, difficulty of terrain,<br/>

Welcome to letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
Most people I have seen have stamps with just images my stamp (image<br/>
attached) has words on it.  One thing to consider is the most common log<br/>
seems to be a 3x5 index card spiral, you would want to have room for your<br/>
stamp (or stamps if more than one of you goes letterboxing together and you<br/>
each have a stamp) plus room for the date, perhaps a note and a signature of<br/>
some form.<br/>

My personal stamp is only about 1" x 1.25", my husband's (Eric too) is
1" x 1.5" and my daughter's is about 1" square.  I carved mine and
my daughter's while Eric did his own.  I can email you a copy of ours. 
I tried to make the 2 that I carved match our personalities somewhat or
they're somewhat related to who we are.  My husband's is a fish (Pisces),
but it looks more like a shark...hrm...But all 3 are pretty simple looking.

I don't know if one exists, but pretty much all 4 of our letterboxes are
on easy terrain - the end of 1 of them might be a bit hard for a 2 year
old, but not an out of shape 33 year old (lol).  2 of them are right
off  paved walking trails and would take just minutes to get to and
log in.  3 of them are located in Peterborough, NH and 1 is in Rye,
NH (clues for this are not up yet).  Our daughter is 15 months old
so distance, duration and terrain have all been big factors in where we've
placed our 2 most recent boxes.  We carry her in a baby backpack when
we go on our walks in the woods.

<br/>
We hike with Bruce's 4-year-old. When she was smaller, we just <br/>
carried her when she was tired, but now that's not an option. We just <br/>
choose shorter hikes, the difficult terrian she likes (she <br/>
climbs like a spider)--just not the distance. And, we sometimes have <br/>
to turn back without our quary if it takes longer than expected.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 3.  Trish posted about a gathering in New England...what exactly <br/>
goes on at<br/>

<br/>
Chanting incantations, crazy-naked ritual sacrifices, all-night <br/>
merriment and the gratuitous consumption of burnt offerings--you <br/>
know, ordinary picnic stuff like that <grin>.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we'll be able to attend this next one. Hope it will be on a <br/>
Saturday!<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I am new to the list and to letterboxing, and am anxious to get<br/>
&gt; started!  I live in Lompoc, CA which is on the central coast of the<br/>
&gt; state.  I see on the website that there are several letterboxes nearby ~<br/>
&gt; can't wait to start looking!<br/>

something totally unrelated (isn't that always the case). I am <br/>
totally intrigued and can't wait to get started! I think this is a <br/>
great activity to do with my family (we love hiking and this is an <br/>
added bonus!). I checked the LB web site and didn't see many boxes <br/>
in our area yet (Johnston County, North Carolina). Are there other <br/>
sources for box locations or is the web site the best place to find <br/>
them? <br/>

Letterboxing.org is indeed the best place. There are unlisted cuckoo <br/>
boxes across the country that you find out about through word of <br/>
mouth or by finding a box that IS listed on the Web site, and a clue <br/>
in that listed box tells you to go to another location to find the <br/>
unlisted cuckoo box. It's not known how many cuckoo boxes there are.<br/>
<br/>
You could also browse through the letterboxing Webring for boxes that <br/>
for whatever reason are on someone's personal Web page but not on <br/>
letterboxing.org.<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget to check the mystery boxes on the Web site as well. Who <br/>
knows? There may be more in Johnston County than you first thought!<br/>
<br/>
And you'll hear a lot on this group the saying, "Plant them and they <br/>
will come!" That's how all areas that now have boxes started out.<br/>
<br/>

learn about letterboxing - there are a lot of good people willing and <br/>

personalities here - it sometimes helps to have a thick hide so you <br/>
