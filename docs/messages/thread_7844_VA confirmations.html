Hmm.  At the risk of giving away too much of Ladybugs <br/>
mystery....By looking at the letters you should be able to figure <br/>
out which letters were placed on the board.  Yes, putting the tiles <br/>
on the board would help.  Though we (the cat woman and I) <br/>
didn't do it that way.  The cat woman is the one who really helped <br/>
here, she has a remarkable facility with letters.  I have probably <br/>
twice the vocabulary, but she can see how mixed up letters make <br/>
words.  She STOMPS me in scrabble.  We stopped playing <br/>
scrabble together years ago, my ego couldn't take it. :-)<br/>
