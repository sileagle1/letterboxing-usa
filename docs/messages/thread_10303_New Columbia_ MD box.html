Find your way to the Columbia Lakefront.  Starting from Clyde's Restaurant, keep the lake on your right and follow the path that borders the lake.  You will pass Tomato Palace, Malibu Grill, and Sushi Sono.  Continue along the path.  You will eventually come to two wooden foot bridges.  Between the two bridges, you see signs for the now delapitated Excercise stations.  After crossing the second bridge, you will soon see what looks like two benches stuck together.  They were part of the old excercise trail.  As you sit down to rest on the benches you will notice a HUGE tree to the left of the benches.  The H is for Heron box is hiding at the base of the tree behind some logs and sticks.<br/>
