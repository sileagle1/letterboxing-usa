Dreams do come true when we believe in love and synchronicity.  <br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time there were two very lovely people who had experienced a tear in their dreams of love<br/>
<br/>
..neither of these people knew each other nor did they know the pain each had seen in their lives<br/>
<br/>
...each walking along in their life, recovering from their separate wounds<br/>
<br/>
...each seeing another new day as a new beginning<br/>
<br/>
..not for a moment, knowing that love would catch them by surprise and wonder, that synchronicity would bring them together to celebrate a love that would blossom and grow.<br/>
<br/>
A love that would inspire others who had known similar pain<br/>
<br/>
...a love that would bless others<br/>
<br/>
..a love that they shared with others<br/>
<br/>
As love grew, these happy lovers decided that they would get married in a castle of love, and on that day the guests sang and danced in the castle's halls singing the following song <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fall is here, the sky is blue<br/>
Birds will sing as if they knew<br/>
Today's the day, we'll say "I do"<br/>
And we'll never be lonely any more<br/>
<br/>
Because we're going to the 'Castle',<br/>
<br/>
  And we're gonna get married.<br/>
Going to the 'Castle',<br/>
And we're gonna get married.<br/>
Gee I really love you,<br/>
And we're gonna get married<br/>
Going to the 'Castle' of love<br/>
Bells will ring, the sun will shine,<br/>
I will be hers, and she'll be mine.<br/>
We'll love until the end of time.<br/>
And we'll never be lonely any more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
.. so inspired were we (YIMS and Lonemasswolf) by the celebration as well as by the joy that this couple share that we decided a letterbox commemorating this event was in order..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
