Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am contemplating putting out a letterbox series based on The HitchHikers Guide to The Galaxy. I was thinking of doing something different. I was thinking of basing the concept of the boxes on The Heart of Gold's improbablity drive, placing the boxes and then leaving instructions for the next finder to take the box with them and place it near another letterbox or in a different locatin near by but leave instructions at the old site where the box can now be found. Sort of like a mystery box/ scavenger hunt thing. The instructions would include something like this:<br/>
<br/>
Now you have found (insert box name and # here) you can leave it here, take the box with you and place it near another letterbox or simple place the box in a different location near by. If you take the box with you or place it in a different location please leave instructions where the new box location is in it's place. You can leave the instructions in a new box, a zip lock baggies with the instructions clearly written, or any type of container you think would be found an'm sure d withstand the elements. Also, please rehide the box well. If you do not feel comfortable with doing anything feel free to stamp away and rehide the box where you found it.<br/>
<br/>
If you do re place the box elsewhere please email me the new location instructions at (email addy). Thank you<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure someone has thought of this in the past so I don't expect the idea to be new or original. Just looking for some insight if it sounds intersting or feesible, I know the whole thing only works if the finders really do take the time to write instructions, rehide the box and email me which maybe too much for some people. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, here are my thoughts. I think this would be very similar to a HH. My question is this, what if someone takes the box (not knowing where they are going toplant it) and doesn't leave instructions. Or, takes the box, leaves instructions but moves it significantly far away (like to another state). This may render it impossile to follow the trail. Hmmmm, interesting conept, I'm curious if it works out. Let us know, The B Hunters<br/>

Genreally speaking, its a neato idea.  Improbability drive... sweet! But<br/>
it just seems a little 'complicated' (man, I can NOT find the right<br/>
words lately! So if I wanted to move the box, and write instructions to<br/>
a new place... would I have to stop right then and there, write the<br/>
instructions out on whatever I have handy, and leave it in that box?<br/>
That seems a little inconvenient.  Could I take it home, relax and think<br/>
about where I want to move it to, write up the instructions nice and<br/>
neatly and maybe laminate it, because I have no clue when the next<br/>
person will find the instructions and I don't want it ruined it the<br/>
meanwhile? But then I'd have to go all the way back to that box I got it<br/>
from and put the instructions in there.<br/>
<br/>
I'm just trying to think it out here, not shoot the idea down... because<br/>
I LOVE the concept.<br/>
<br/>
If you get the details worked out, I'd love to copy your general idea ;-)<br/>

<br/>
I am little leary about the whole placing near another letterbox, the idea behind it was if the finder wanted to take the box but didn't have anything planned but was on their way to another letterbox. I was also thinking of putting the concept instructions on the clue page so the person would have a heads up if they wanted. <br/>
<br/>
Xeen brought up a good point to, what if the finder takes the box out of state. I was also thinking maybe asking the finder to feel free to switch the boxes within the series around, for example box number 4 is where box 1 was originally planted or something. <br/>
<br/>
The whole series is still a work in progress, I was also thinking of making them hitchhikers. <br/>
