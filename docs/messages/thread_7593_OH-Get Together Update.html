<br/>
1) Yes, PLEASE bring the Kids<br/>
<br/>
2) I do not think we will eat BUT<br/>
   you are welcome to bring something<br/>

   plan on meeting for an hour. BUT!<br/>
   in no means an hour is all. <br/>
<br/>
3) Yes! There will be a few new boxes<br/>

    If you feel in the mood to<br/>
   stop by that park and hid a box or <br/>
   two before hand. Please Do. That <br/>

   What I plan to do is hide the boxes<br/>
   and bring copys of the Clues with me<br/>

If it is going to be near Dayton,  I'd definately suggest John Bryan <br/>
where we have a strong relationship with the park management.  <br/>
Huffman Dam works, but I have had to go out and show the manager <br/>
where each box is.  <br/>
<br/>
Besides there are 30 some boxes in John Bryan and only a couple in <br/>
Huffman!<br/>
<br/>
I can be back in Dayton from the Soccer by afternoon.  <br/>
<br/>
If I can be of any help in setting up a reservation for a picnic <br/>
pavilion, I will do so.  A nice one is in the lower parking lot at <br/>
John Bryan.  <br/>
<br/>
Coolwan,  if you preplace boxes, please stop by the park office and <br/>
let them register you as a box placer.  They do have a restriction <br/>
that the boxes need to be within 10 feet of trails or within 10 feet <br/>
of any of the edges of the public areas and picnic grounds.  <br/>
