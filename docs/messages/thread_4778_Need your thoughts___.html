boxes in their state parks or whatever.<br/>

<p>Moto,</p>
<p>     A newspaper article is how I found out about letterboxing in the first place. The article was actually about Geocaching and while checking up on that on the internet I found a post for one of Scott Redd's Caches that happened to also be a letterbox. That led me to want to find out what a letterbox was, and after that I was hooked. If you do decide to talk to the reporter, I would just make sure that he knows that we are all about preserving the outdoors and getting people outside visiting with nature. I hope this helps.<br/><br/><br/>Happy Boxing, </p></div>

My thoughts are to keep it somewhat vague. I was approached by the local<br/>
radio station to be on a talk / discussion show about letterboxing. I<br/>
hesitated as it's also a great way for the  evil minded to track clues from<br/>
web sites and vandalize the boxes. I think, although it's sad to realize<br/>
this, but there are folks who derive some sort of twisted pleasure from this<br/>
activity of destruction. I ended up choosing not to go on air. There's so<br/>
many wonderful people involved wit LB but as I stated, there are people who<br/>
will seize the moment as well as the box. If this reporter will write a<br/>
story anyway, then I agree with others who say, at least get him to make the<br/>
connection with it being outdoors with nature and preserving the planet as<br/>
best as we can. Like Bill said, give him (the reporter) a positive spin on<br/>
it. Remember details can be read by the wrong folks just as easily as the<br/>
good people.<br/>

I have been trained by the airlines to not talk to media.  (They <br/>
really frown on us ever giving a statement about ANYTHING!)<br/>
<br/>
So I am often leary of talking to the press, but I discovered <br/>
letterboxing thru the Smithsonian article and then rediscovered it <br/>
with the blurb in Backpacker (or was it Outside?)<br/>
<br/>
So maybe it won't be a bad thing.  It kind of depends on how the <br/>
article comes out!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello, fellow letterboxers. I need your input. <br/>
&gt; I was approached by a journalist wanting to do a short phone <br/>
interview<br/>
&gt; about letterboxing in Ohio. He is located in Cincinnati, and <br/>
noticed I<br/>
&gt; have placed a few letterboxes in the area. I guess that's why he <br/>
wanted<br/>
&gt; to speak to me. At first I was thinking it would be a good <br/>
promotion for<br/>
&gt; the sport, ( more 'boxers more fun) . But then again my second <br/>
thoughts<br/>
&gt; were what if I say the wrong thing and the letterbox clues get in <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; wrong hands. My biggest worry is having the Parks in Ohio on an all <br/>
out<br/>
&gt; alert looking for letterboxers ! I would much rather tell a friend <br/>
about<br/>
&gt; letterboxing (by word of mouth ) than have a stranger read about <br/>
it. I'm<br/>
&gt; sure the journalist is going to write the story with ,or without my<br/>
&gt; input.... Any thoughts ?? Thanks in advance for any help.....<br/>
