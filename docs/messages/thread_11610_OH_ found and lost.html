i'm just beginning this journey into letterboxing and loving it. so <br/>
nice to finally have a use for these stamps i've carved over the <br/>
years (i knew i would find a reason for them). <br/>
yesterday, i found two letterboxes, A Rose is a Rose, and  Whet-<br/>
stone. the microbox that was supposed to be found on the way to the <br/>
Whet-stone box was no where to be found. there were a few recent <br/>
entries in the journal that made it seem like the microbox hasn't <br/>
been seen for a while. we also looked for the OSU box, which we <br/>
didn't find, but it's been a hard winter and the stump that i think <br/>
it was hidden in is quite deteriorated. i'm looking forward to <br/>
finding many more boxes and perhaps finding outdoor homes for some of <br/>
my beloved stamps. <br/>

On 03/16 we looked for and couldn't find those two either. We did find A <br/>
Rose is a Rose and the Whetstone LB. In addition to the two found, on <br/>
the 17th I located Leather Lips and Field of Corn as I was heading home <br/>
to Rochester, NY. This was my first time out so I had to hand draw the <br/>
stamp I was working on. My daughter and her family live in Columbus so <br/>
maybe the next time i go back, the two that are lost will have been <br/>
replaced.<br/>
