Judi &amp; Liz are correct about scented stamp pads attracting animals. <br/>
The very first box we planted was opened by a raccoon, no doubt <br/>
attracted by the fruity smelling stamp pad. He (or she) then ate the <br/>
rubber stamp.<br/>

I often use a stamp pad made by Ranger called Adirondak. It comes in<br/>
cool blended multicolors and says acid free and permanant. <br/>
So my story?<br/>
Ranger started making another stamp pad called Big and Juicy which has<br/>
even more vivid colors in the blues and greens I so love and I wanted<br/>
to use them for a letterboxing expedition to Oregon. So I called<br/>
Ranger to ask if they were the same kind of ink as the Adirondak, they<br/>
laughed at me and said no way.<br/>
I didn't really believe them.<br/>
But, just before I left I decided that I really should do a test, so I<br/>
stamped on a piece of paper, one stamp of each type and dunked the<br/>
paper under the faucet. The Big and Juicy bled just a little bit but<br/>
not much and I thought it would be fine.<br/>
Well, hours later I walked by the paper in the trash and by golly, I<br/>
could hardly make out my stamp done with the Big and Juicy but the<br/>
Adirondak one was just fine.<br/>
So lesson learned...................<br/>
Maybe do a test on your pads.<br/>
<br/>
Good Hunting,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Nisha -- I appreciate the tip on Adirondak vs. B&amp;J. I was<br/>
hoping to get from my post a list of good vs bad brands of stamp pads,<br/>
but since I mentioned that the kind on sale were scented, most of the<br/>
conversation wandered off in another direction. :)<br/>
<br/>
On or offlist, I would love to hear from experienced boxers who have<br/>
used a gamut of stamp pads if there is a brand they would heartily<br/>
recommend or not. I am clear on the thumbs down to scented pads, and<br/>
the thumbs up to the acid free, permanent. Just so I know what to buy<br/>
up for my letterbox repair kit when it comes on sale.<br/>

Thanks! :)<br/>

Ink It Up! has a pigment ink stamp pad that costs $1.99.  It is what <br/>
I use to both plant boxes and use for my signature stamp.<br/>
<br/>
And never mind what it says about it taking longer to dry.  I don't <br/>
think the difference between 3 seconds and 5 seconds is all that long!<br/>
<br/>
I also use a Sharpie ultrafine permanent marker as my writing tool.<br/>
<br/>
I have been back to boxes that I had visited previously that have <br/>
gotten wet, and many of the images have washed out but my signature <br/>
stamp is still clear.<br/>

jem_heist prefers Speedyball Speedy Stamps in the pink variety.  They also make a white/grey pad that seems to crumble a bit too easily.  You can find this decently sized block at Michaels for about 6 dollars.<br/>

On or offlist, I would love to hear from experienced boxers who have<br/>
used a gamut of stamp pads if there is a brand they would heartily<br/>
recommend or not. I am clear on the thumbs down to scented pads, and<br/>
the thumbs up to the acid free, permanent. Just so I know what to buy<br/>
up for my letterbox repair kit when it comes on sale.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! :)<br/>

&gt; Well, hours later I walked by the paper in the trash and by golly, I<br/>

I have had great success with VersaColor stamp pads. They have a <br/>
very vibrant, permanent color. I also use a fluid Chalk inkpad made <br/>
by Colorbox. It is fade resistant.<br/>
