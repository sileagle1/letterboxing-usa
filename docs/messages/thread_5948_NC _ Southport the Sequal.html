planted the first I guess I'll plant the Sequal. Southport is known <br/>
for Movies being made there. "Crimes of the Heart, I Know What You <br/>
Did Last Summer, Summer Catch" And others. So the Southport the <br/>
Sequal was an interesting concept. Enjoy.<br/>

SOUTHPORT THE SEQUAL<br/>
Clues:<br/>
After coming such a long ways I am sure you are curious about such an <br/>
out of the way town. So why not go to the most "Knowledgable" <br/>
building in Southport.<br/>
<br/>
Stop awhile and learn more of the history about this small Historical <br/>
Town.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on toward the small park which it's "Center" attraction is <br/>
one of mother natures "Old" friends. <br/>
<br/>
The gazebo behind this friend shelters the box in which you seek. <br/>
<br/>
Please... This is a busy part of town let none see you take or <br/>
replace the box. <br/>
<br/>
Now go and take a look around. I am sure you will find a few things <br/>
in the area to peek your interest.<br/>
