been joined by six new letterboxes in a trail chain, and so is now <br/>
considered No. 1 in the chain of 7.<br/>

Clues:<br/>
<br/>
SEVEN FROM THE FLORIDA ANCIENTS<br/>
<br/>
County: Volusia<br/>
Nearest city: DeLand<br/>
<br/>
Fee area.<br/>
Leashed dogs ok.<br/>
Easy clues.<br/>
Wetlands. Wear mosquito/tick protection; if it has rained recently your feet <br/>
might get wet.<br/>
Trail is easily negotiated and well-traveled; however, it is natural and not <br/>
blazed.<br/>
<br/>
The Timucuan people lived for thousands of years along the Atlantic coast <br/>
and inland rivers in what are now Georgia and Florida. Those who did not die <br/>
from the diseases unintentionally imported by the Spanish explorers died <br/>
from starvation while being used as slaves, moving goods along the road <br/>
between St. Augustine and the Gulf Coast at Apalachee.  The race died out in <br/>
the late 1700s, and most of what is known about them is from the accounts <br/>
kept by their captors and a few archeological sites such as the one youll <br/>
visit while finding these boxes.<br/>
<br/>
All the hand-carved stamps in this series are copies of drawings of their <br/>
art or representative of some other aspect of their culture.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes are numbered in the order they may be found, along a single <br/>
out-and-back nature trail.  All the boxes have brush pads but not pens.<br/>
<br/>
Compass directions are approximate; for the most part, steps cant be in a <br/>
straight line.  Palmettos crowd the scene; look to the oaks for your clues.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Pontoon to Hontoon<br/>
Follow Nature Trail<br/>

NO. 1 - Swamp Owl<br/>
Planted 1-7-2002 in memory of Brenton Gustav Gregory b. 5-10-14, d. <br/>
1-7-2001.<br/>
He was a carver and an adventurer; he would have loved letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Watching signs: live oak, death gives life, wax myrtle, lichens, saw <br/>
palmetto, slash pine then stop at blank!<br/>
<br/>
215 Small Woman steps to small dead tree in path just before Large oak.<br/>
<br/>
Step to right of tree; turn your back to it.<br/>
Look up and 280-ish to see Left left-leaning tree.<br/>
Go there...could be 20 steps.<br/>
