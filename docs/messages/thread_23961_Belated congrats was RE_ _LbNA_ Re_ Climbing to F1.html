Belated Congratulations!!  I am way behind on reading posts but this one<br/>
caught my eye!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You continue to inspire me to push my boundaries and become even more than I<br/>
currently am.  Not because of the numbers, impressive as they are, but<br/>
because of the actual accomplishments.  Anyone only looking at your F # is<br/>
missing the bigger picture, that is for sure!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
May you have many more happy hikes and treasured finds.  <br/>
<br/>

*                           &lt;&lt; Thanks for all the kind words, folks,<br/>
especially considering that in a<br/>
world often fraught<br/>
with animosity, jealousy and insecurity, it might be difficult for some<br/>
people to be gracious<br/>
about the accomplishments of others! &gt;&gt;<br/>
