<div>Small rocky island, most easily accessed from the

<div>15-20 pine trees identify this hiding spot, midway

<div>This is a gorgeous spot and well worth a low-key

THE ANDRES INSTITUTE LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Dancing Feet<br/>
Date: Placed:  11/02/02<br/>
Location:  Brookline, New Hampshire<br/>
Rated: Easy, Moderate hike.<br/>
COMPASS NEEDED<br/>
<br/>
Art and nature lovers, this beautiful spot is one of New Hampshire’s hidden <br/>
treasures. Two dozen sculptures are scattered along the hiking trails of the <br/>
Andres Institute atop Big Bear Mountain on Rt. 13 in Brookline, NH. These <br/>
sculpture trails are open to foot traffic, including cross country ski and <br/>
snowshoe traffic, year round. Take water, hiking shoes, binoculars, a camera <br/>
and of course a compass. There is a nice place to sit and have a picnic at <br/>
the top of the “hill” if the weather permits. <br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
The Andres Institute is located on Rt. 13 in Brookline, NH.<br/>
Park in back of the Big Bear Lodge on Rt. 13. A trailhead is located in the <br/>
rear of the parking lot. Pick up a trail map and head left to the driveway <br/>
gate.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Follow the sculpture trail to Phoenix.<br/>
Place your compass at its base.<br/>
Locate 270 degrees and look behind the farthest small boulder on this line.<br/>
Please be sure to replace the box carefully. It is inaccessible with snow <br/>
cover.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  The STUDIO, the steel building, may be visited when artists are <br/>
present with their permission. Stop by and ask.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE PACK OUT ALL TRASH.<br/>
<br/>
ENJOY!<br/>
