                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow! 2 Gray Squirrels boxes are great. My wife and I headed over to the<br/>
Wheaton Park in MD in search of more stamps for our log.<br/>
<br/>
Being my wife's first hunt, she was really excited. It was a little hot and<br/>
humid, but no complaints here.<br/>
<br/>
All three of the boxes were in great shape and had excellent clues. The were<br/>
all "very well visited" by other LetterBoxers.<br/>
<br/>
As fate would have it we ran into another family "on the hunt" and had the<br/>
chance to exchange stamps with two members from their family. They didn't<br/>
know about the list here, so I told them to check us out. So hopefully we<br/>
will be interacting with yet another family of Letterboxers on the list real<br/>
soon.<br/>
