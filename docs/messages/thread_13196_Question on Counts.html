Suppose you were in on a plant. <br/>
The box disappeared.<br/>
The planter carved a new stamp and hid the box in a slightly <br/>
different location. <br/>
You were not in on the plant this time.<br/>
If you find the box this time, can you count it as a Find?<br/>
<br/>
Just a debated question between me and JugglerMouse,<br/>
