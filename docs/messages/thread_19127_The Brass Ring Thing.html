this, so...<br/>
<br/>
Last Saturday, I sent TD an e-mail stating that I would be<br/>
letterboxing in their neck of the woods.  They cleverly deduced that I<br/>
was attending the Brass Ring Thing Renaissance Faire at the nearby<br/>
Carousel Museum and they actually managed to hunt me down.<br/>
<br/>
We declared it to be an official letterboxing event and exchanged<br/>
stamps, giving each of us our very first event and exchange counts. <br/>
We also exchanged hitch-hikers.  I gave them Soaring Seagull and they<br/>
gave me Weary Willie.  All in all, an excellent time.  I actually<br/>
filled two pages in my album with all the new stamps.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I'm now the holder of "Lobo the Hobo", a travelling letterbox. <br/>
If you printed out clues for him, they're no longer valid.  I found a<br/>
magnificent spot for him and I should have the clues tested and posted<br/>
by the end of next week.  For updates, check out my letterboxing<br/>
webpage at http://www-cs.canisius.edu/~salley/Letterboxing<br/>
