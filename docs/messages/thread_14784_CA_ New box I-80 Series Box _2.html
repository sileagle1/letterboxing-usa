Clues: Easy<br/>
Distance: just out of your car<br/>

Hopefully you've found Box #1 in Auburn. Return to the freeway and continue <br/>
east on Interstate 80 towards Truckee.  Since this box can only be reached from <br/>
the exit when traveling west, you'll have to bear with us as we get you <br/>
there. Take the Emigrant Gap exit (eastbound). Go left at the stop sign then left <br/>
again to reenter the freeway, westbound. You'll see a "Vista Point 1/2 mile" <br/>
sign. Exit Vista Point. Park and find the Emigrant Gap Monument plaque and read <br/>
it. It tells of the hundreds of covered wagons that had to be lowered by ropes <br/>
to the floor of Bear Valley as people came west to make their fortune. In the <br/>
plaque, you will note that two different years appear in the text. Subtract <br/>
one from the other and divide this number b 5. Now, find the "blue star". From <br/>
the walkway in front of it, proceed west along the stone wall this many paces. <br/>
On the other side of the wall, under a rock, you will find the letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
To continue on this letterbox series, you'll easily be able to reenter the <br/>
freeway by taking the Nyack Road exit and get back on Interstate 80, eastbound <br/>
again.<br/>
