you can leave it in the same box you found it.  It's still a find.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, hitchhikers were made to travel, so if you can take it, <br/>
do.  But some letterboxers may not because they know they won't have <br/>

<br/>
As for hostels, the request is that you only take the hitchhiker if <br/>
you have one to leave behind.  Anjabanja and I found a hostel a <br/>
short while ago, but did not have a hitchhiker in our possession.  <br/>
Thus, we counted two finds -- the hostel and the hitchhiker -- but <br/>
took nothing with us.<br/>
<br/>
If you find a hostel with more than one hitchhiker, you could take <br/>
one or all of them -- as long as you leave at least one behind <br/>
(preferably one you brought yourself).  Whether you take any or all, <br/>
all boxes (including the hostel) are finds.<br/>

This link ought to fix you up.<br/>
http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/travelers#gohostels<br/>
<br/>
It's a "station" so to speak where hitchhikers pass through and are picked up and <br/>
dropped off. There are a few sprinkled across the country. <br/>

<br/>
It was my understanding (it at least works this way at the Wells <br/>
Transportation HH Hostel) that HH exchange was strictly on a one for one <br/>
basis. If you found three in the box you should leave it with three in <br/>
the box. This gives more variety for boxers to choose from in case they <br/>
have already logged into some of the HHs that are there. Again, more <br/>
experienced boxers may correct me if I am wrong.<br/>
