My San Diego Sails Letterbox went missing earlier this year<br/>
so I turned it into an "online" LB.  If you visit its former<br/>
location (Torrey Pines), you can download the stamp from the<br/>
clue page and make an entry in my online logbook.  The park is<br/>
well worth a visit so I hope you go for it!<br/>

Last November we found both Old San Diego boxes, in Old Town and <br/>
Shelter Island.  They are both still listed on the LB website.<br/>

I, too found Old Town and Shelter Island back in March.  At that<br/>
time, Shelter Island was missing its stamp, but I think it has<br/>
been replaced.  You might want to check with the placer.<br/>
