I understand the copyright restrictions, and if you get permission that you can use it how the permission is granted to you. HOwever, I strongly getting any permission in writing with a real signature affixed to the *permission slip*.<br/>

&gt; The reasoning was that LBNA *proper* was not hosting the evetn, I was, <br/>
&gt; therefore LBNA did not want to be associated as being the *sponsor/host* <br/>
&gt; of the event.<br/>
<br/>
(disclaimer -- IANAL and this is not legal advice or opinion)<br/>
<br/>
What is "LbNA proper"?<br/>
<br/>
Who, other than the creator of the artwork and name has the authority<br/>
to grant or deny this permission?   Its just a word and a piece of<br/>
artwork.  No corpus.  How can "LBNA" sponsor/host an event?  If Mitch<br/>
said no, that may or may not have been valid.  If anyone else said no,<br/>
you were mislead ... (at least as to who has authority to say no)<br/>
<br/>
(but it sounds as tho you should be careful, because someone sounds <br/>
protective of this stuff.  BTW, I created the name "Letterboxing North <br/>
America" and placed it in the public domain _after_ the logo was created -- <br/>
that shows how much I care -- but my IP is reflected in the logo -- so I <br/>
prolly co-own the rights to it, if someone somewhere is trying to turn <br/>
this into some sort of ******* contest :-))<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Not trying to cause controversy here....just my $.02<br/>
<br/>
Nor I, just trying to clarify.  This stuff was all developed in a community<br/>
spirit, so we should all just be able to use it.  Your gathering, tho I<br/>
wasn't there, seemed to be in that spirit ... <br/>
<br/>

You're right!  I was thinking the question was concerning making your own personal patch or T-shirt logo that included the LbNA logo in it.  Sponsorship would be more sticky.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">First, no one should take this "badly".  If in doubt,<br/>
I mean whatever sounds offensive in a very light tone.<br/>
I consider this a fun hobby, a way to learn about new<br/>
hikes and perhaps even meet people.  Arguing about<br/>
who can do what COMPLETELY misses the point.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I understand the copyright restrictions, and if you<br/>
&gt; get permission that you can use it how the permission<br/>
&gt; is granted to you. HOwever, I strongly getting any<br/>
&gt; permission in writing with a real signature affixed<br/>
&gt; to the *permission slip*.<br/>
<br/>
Let me get this straight... We trespass (public locations,<br/>
but used in a manner unknown to and sometimes deliberately<br/>
antagonistic to the wishes of the official owners), arguably<br/>
vandalize and/or litter, and tamper with historical sites<br/>
(doesn't matter if you leave the box in the middle of an<br/>
open lawn, technically we tamper), and people worry about<br/>
enforcement of the copyright on the LBNA logo?  <g><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
I thought we had already posted this, but I don't see it<br/>
in the archive, so:  RIBNAG publishes all of its material <br/>
under the GPL FDL, about which you can find more info at<br/>
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#FDL<br/>
<br/>
In message 6286, Randy released the name "Letterboxing<br/>
North America" into the public domain. <br/>
<br/>
In message 6433, Eric Mings placed the entire<br/>
letterboxing.com site into the public domain.<br/>
<br/>
In message 1619, we learn that Dan considers clues AND<br/>
STAMPS residing on the letterboxing.org site as public<br/>
domain.<br/>
<br/>
While Mitch expressed a difference of opinion on the<br/>
last point, we can basically consider *either* stance<br/>
moot, due to the very similar issue of "who owns Yahoo<br/>
list content?"... Namely, Yahoo (though they officially<br/>
disclaim ownership, they reserve the unconditional<br/>
right to use any posted content, including files and<br/>
pictures, however they want).  If they decide to sell a<br/>
book containing all *our* posts for some strange reason,<br/>
they don't have to ask our permission or pay us a dime.<br/>
Posting to this list counts as implied consent.  Or to<br/>
put it another way, the kids may argue who gets the candy,<br/>
but the parents can still take it away regardless of who<br/>
wins.<br/>
<br/>
Checking the Files and Photos sections on our list, I<br/>
see...<br/>
<br/>
That we can all stop bickering.  We can either accept<br/>
that most of the body of letterboxing-oriented material<br/>
has effectively entered the public domain via Yahoo, or<br/>
we can look forward to an eventual schism that won't<br/>
benefit *ANY* of us.<br/>
<br/>
Since people care so much about making this hobby<br/>
horribly complicated, I would suggest we all make<br/>
clear the copyright status of our work.  For those<br/>
of us who consider this "fun" and don't really want<br/>
to bother with the hassle of all this ownership<br/>
crap, I would recommend the GPL FDL.  For everyone<br/>
else, you have every right to make your work as<br/>
restrictive as possible, but don't shoot yourselves<br/>
in the foot (feet?).<br/>
<br/>
Tell 'ya what - If Mitch gives an official statement that<br/>
we can't use his logo, I'll honor it.  I will then proceed<br/>
to commission any of several artist friends to produce<br/>
something functionally identical but compositionally<br/>
different, and put it under the GPL FDL along with the<br/>
rest of RIBNAG's content, and you can all use *that* to<br/>
your hearts' delight.  I seriously do not expect to have<br/>
to do that, I have always believed Mitch feels the same<br/>
as the rest of us and does this for enjoyment, not<br/>
possible future profit.  And for that I thank him, and<br/>
all the other gods-of-letterboxing who make the American<br/>
version of this hobby possible.<br/>
<br/>
But lighten up, people.  If you stopped having fun,<br/>
find a new hobby.  If not, get away from the computer<br/>
and hit the trails.<br/>
