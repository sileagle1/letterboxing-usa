Two weeks ago we did the "Creatures of Fountain Head Park" series of 5<br/>
boxes.  We found all 5 and they were in great shape. The kiddos loved the<br/>
Scooby theme,so did I because I used to have a crush on Fred growing up, but<br/>
I digress from my point...  The next day Knights of Columbo came out with<br/>
the 6th in the series, what a blow to my type A personality who likes to<br/>
check things off her list...(I thought I completed that series and now I'm<br/>
off to the next).  No, I look forward to finding #6 to complete my series,<br/>
I'm saving a page in my notebook.  Thanks Knights of Columbo!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Easter to all!<br/>
Happy Homeschoolers<br/>
