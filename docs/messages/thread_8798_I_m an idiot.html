pirate when I get home.  I think I might be able to squeeze a 7 on <br/>
that hat.  I'm sure it will be off-centered, but a 007 pirate is <br/>
better than a 00 pirate.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.<br/>

P.S. I'll probably make the "7" backwards.<br/>

Maybe they aren't zeros on his hat...maybe they are the eyeballs from one of <br/>
his victims...Just a little Halloween spirit left in me...*grin*<br/>

&gt;Subject: [LbNA] I'm an idiot<br/>
&gt;Date: Thu, 31 Oct 2002 17:46:19 -0000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I carved my personal stamp yesterday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It took me about 2 hours and it was this really detailed pirate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Then, I carved my initials into his hat, and what do you know? They<br/>
&gt;are backwards.  I am new to eraser carving, but I should know better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dammit! That was the one too.  So I am going to try to make the inits<br/>
&gt;(C.G.) into two zeros.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why would a pirate have two zeros on his hat? Don't ask me.<br/>
