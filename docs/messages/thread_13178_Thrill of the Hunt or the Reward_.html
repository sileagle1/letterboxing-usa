I would imagine that the search or clues for the box would make for an interesting letterbox. Case in point ,we just returned from San Luis Obispo a had a absolute ball with Ryan's "Walking Tour " letterbox. If you could set up the letterbox with some sort of a twist similar to what Ryan set up then I would think you would have a winner. Click on his box in SLO and you will see part of what I mean. His "Run for the Border" is another example of some creative clues. Remember there are no rules. Don<br/>

Ugh.  I was reading your post, thinking that I liked the reward of the stamp <br/>
equally as much as the hunt &amp; location--but once you mentioned bushes at <br/>
shopping malls I realized that I wouldn't have much interest in finding that <br/>
box--so I'd have to say that location is VERY important.  (Heather really had to do <br/>
some cajoling to get me to join her in going to THREE freaking <br/>
Jack-in-the-Boxes to figure out Ryan's clues...but even that eventually rewarded us by <br/>
leading somewhere nice.) <br/>
<br/>
I have gone after a few boxes in urban areas--heck, I even planted one in a <br/>
bookstore.  But in those cases, the boxes were still in nice/interesting <br/>
locations.  <br/>
Still--I think that just about anywhere you'd plant 'em, somebody would come. <br/>
 (Flood channels, tho?  At some point it'd likely be washed away, right?)<br/>

&gt;I was thinking about putting boxes in urban areas<br/>
<br/>
We've just begun locating places for boxes and my son had suggested planting<br/>
equal numbers out in the wild and within the city. His reasoning was it<br/>
would allow those with physical disabilities to participate. He's doing<br/>
letterboxing as a 4-H project, so one of his goals was to make the hobby<br/>
more available to the members within his club, some of whom can't make it<br/>
out into the wilds but could easily make it to a box hidden within the city.<br/>
<br/>
So we vote for yes, plant them in urban areas! The thrill, we feel, lies in<br/>
finding the box, adding the stamp, knowing there is a secret shared by a<br/>
small group of people. Yes, the fresh air, wildflowers and poison oak are<br/>
fun, but we can walk in the woods to get those should we feel the need after<br/>
locating too many urban boxes :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would agree with Don and Gwen.  Urban boxes can be rewarding, <br/>
challenging and fun, it depends on the nature of the box, the clues <br/>
and still, the location.<br/>
<br/>
Part of what makes letterboxing fun is the variety...  the variety of <br/>
stamps, the variety of log books, the variety of folks you meet, the <br/>
variety of clues, the variety of locations.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, I have a couple of boxes planted at the top of very <br/>
large sand dunes near the lake here in Michigan, which provide a <br/>
great location, a fantastic view from the top, and a good amount of <br/>
exercise.  Because it is not the norm, people joke about it and <br/>
say, "wow, you made us work for that, but it was really fun..." even <br/>
though every bone in their body is aching.  But I can bet if every <br/>
box I planted was at the top of a sand dune, it would get boring real <br/>
fast.  Just like if every box was a 5-mile hike through pristine old <br/>
growth forest, the kind where the air is clean and cool and <br/>
everything is bright green, it would still get to be a bit of the <br/>
same after a while.  As hikes go, I could do that every day and not <br/>
tire of it.  But as a letterboxing experience, it couldn't maintain <br/>
the thrill.  Same goes for clues, it is the variety that keeps them <br/>
fun and interesting, some being just straightforward, leading you <br/>
right to the box, others frustrating you for hours, days, even weeks <br/>
to figure out just the starting point.<br/>
<br/>
For me it comes down to the total package, the location being only <br/>
one factor in the overall box experience.  If your location is hum-<br/>
drum, you can still have a killer box by making the clues <br/>
extraordinary, or the stamp, or even the log, or better yet... all of <br/>
the above.  Even a pair of socks is a cool gift if it comes wrapped <br/>
in creative packaging and is delivered to your front door by a <br/>
singing messenger.<br/>

(Who has one box to plant in a location that is anything but beautiful but will lead to a beautiful spot and has great sentimental meaning to me.  Hopefully someone will choose to seek it out.  If not, it was still important to me.)<br/>

All those things are good to me.  I like to find a great stamp, I like to get <br/>
taken some place wonderful or interesting but I guess the best part is the <br/>
hunt and I best love a good puzzle to figure out.<br/>

THis sounds absolutely great and I am always frantically hunting for ways to <br/>
use letterboxing to further my sons' educations and involvement in activities <br/>
- for those of us who do this with children, how did you/he make this a 4H <br/>
project?  How old is he?<br/>

&gt;how did you/he make this a 4H<br/>
&gt;project?  How old is he?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He's doing it as a self determined project actually. In CA where we live,<br/>
there was no project that came close to covering all that letterboxing<br/>
does - cartography, environmental sciences, nature study, hiking/outdoor<br/>
activities - so he went the independent route this year. Next year, he hopes<br/>
to have generated enough interest within the club to have it be a group<br/>
determined project. He's a second-year 4-H member just entering 6th grade,<br/>
so this is his first self-designed project, and he's designed it so that all<br/>
ages of club members (0-19yo in our club) can participate.<br/>
<br/>
His listed goals are, in no particular order, locating boxes in both urban<br/>
and natural areas, placing and monitoring boxes in both urban and natural<br/>
areas, teaching other club members how to hunt for boxes, teach other club<br/>
members how to plant their own boxes, and increasing accessibility to<br/>
disabled members. He put down that the project will take three or more years<br/>
due to it having no set "completion" point.<br/>
<br/>
For the area where 4-H wants to know what he'll do with the learning, he put<br/>
down teaching others how to participate, designing more accessible<br/>
placements for disabled members, and compiling a letterboxing journal to<br/>
share with others which includes both written information about the<br/>
experience and various souvenirs of each hunt - entrance and/or parking<br/>
tickets, mapquest directions to get to the parking area we start from, maps<br/>
and spotting guides from places, we always take a few pictures at each box,<br/>
and in the written areas he talks about the animals, flowers, trees and<br/>
rocks he saw during the hunt. He also talks about people we meet during the<br/>
outings since we seem to find some very interesting folks out there :)<br/>
<br/>
He isn't putting the actual clues into the book, except those of the boxes<br/>
he plants himself. He's undecided still on whether he wants to include the<br/>
actual stamped pages or just scan them and use a copy instead - he's<br/>
protective of his real letterboxing journal and isn't too sure about tearing<br/>
it apart, even for a 4-H project :)<br/>

I have to be selective in the boxes I can look for so I appreciate information such as difficulty and distance within the clues. A couple tricks I have learned is to carefully read the clues and see if the route would be shorter if worked backwards or to use trail maps to determine if there is a shorter route back to the car. <br/>

We've just begun locating places for boxes and my son had suggested planting<br/>
equal numbers out in the wild and within the city. His reasoning was it<br/>
would allow those with physical disabilities to participate. He's doing<br/>
letterboxing as a 4-H project, so one of his goals was to make the hobby<br/>
more available to the members within his club, some of whom can't make it<br/>
out into the wilds but could easily make it to a box hidden within the city.<br/>

<br/>
Good Morning 4-H friends, I'm Leader of the Pack recently lurking <br/>
instead of being fully involved as I have been to busy. Could not <br/>
leave this unanswered.  I am the leader of the Cock-A-Doodle-Moo 4-H <br/>
club. We are in eastern Connecticut. many out this way have seen  <br/>
boxes put out by and for the club and have come to letterboxing <br/>
events at our county 4-H fair.   Don't forget to give him credit for <br/>
the writing portion of this project writing directions is a  great <br/>
skill ( ever assemble a kids toy?) I think the writing and reading of <br/>
directions one of the best kid components of this project. Not to <br/>
mention miles logged and the  guidelines for a fit American youth. <br/>
Wearing a pedometer will help log in how much fitness is being <br/>
gained. We have a couple of handicapped accesible boxes too.  Great <br/>
to see more 4-H picking up this project. Maybe we can do a postal <br/>
exchange with the kids or LB penpals club to club?  Just let me know  <br/>
Carolyn Stearns - Leader of the Pack<br/>
