I know, it's gone beyond obsession, but that's nothing compared to <br/>
Pete &amp; Wanda in RI! I think there may be a tweaked gene somewhere, <br/>
and it's also displayed in CarolS, Ryan, franzsolo, legerdemaine, <br/>
Mapsurfer, the Flyfisher, and a host of others who have given us <br/>
these little hidden gifts. In fact, thinking it over, this gene must <br/>
be ubiquitous throughout boxdom. And when it comes to obsessive <br/>
collecting, no one can compare with the Brits!<br/>
<br/>
There's just something about being out in the world, the air fresh <br/>
and clear or heavy with snow, and that small exhiliration and catch <br/>
of breath as we close in on the prize. When we're out "placing," the <br/>
children get this delighted hide n' seek gleam in their eyes and we <br/>
find ourselves laughing and plotting. Sometimes I think that 50 years <br/>
from now one of my kids will remember those days, maybe while going <br/>
through my old papers and journals, and search out an old box on a <br/>
mountain top, and find it still there.<br/>
