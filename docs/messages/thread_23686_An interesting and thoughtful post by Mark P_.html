I enjoy "regular (non mystery)" boxes the same as everyone else, but<br/>
I would have to say that I truly do a "HAPPY DANCE" (for those of you<br/>
who know a particular group of boxers who really do a happy dance<br/>
when they find a hard box... you know what I mean. Who said winged<br/>
ones can't dance ;-) when I go and find a mystery box.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, Fish or Man, Brandy, Bluebird and I found two fairly new<br/>
mystery boxes. Boy did we do a HAPPY DANCE! It was a very<br/>
satisfying thing!<br/>
<br/>
I would have to say that I agree somewhat with Mark's frustration,<br/>
though the two mysteries we found recently were very good ones and<br/>
fairly difficult ones to find. Having planted my share of mystery<br/>
boxes, I have a tendency to really cherish the mystery boxes that are<br/>
really hard to find. Those are memories that last, and that I truly<br/>
cherish. I'm attempting to figure out two mystery boxes now, that<br/>
I'm having a VERY hard time with. I haven't had a chance to<br/>
letterbox out on the West Coast, but judging by the letterboxing<br/>
characters we have out there (some of whom I've met along the way<br/>
here on the East Coast), I can just imagine what kind of mysteries<br/>
they have out there!<br/>
<br/>
As for the quantity of mystery boxes here in the northeast, I've<br/>
found that a lot of the recent planting has been done by newer boxers<br/>
(we had eight boxes planted here in Manchester alone within the last<br/>
week or two by a new boxer). Furthermore, when I talk with new<br/>
boxers about mystery boxes, they say that they don't "DO" mystery<br/>
boxes. Perhaps a poll should be done on the newbie list to see why?<br/>
<br/>
I personally don't want to see the "dumbing down" of letterboxing. I<br/>
really enjoy a challenge now and then. I thoroughly enjoyed planting<br/>
with Enologist when she planted the two boxes she has, and from what<br/>
she tells me, only a few people have found them. I don't think<br/>
you've found THOSE Mark ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there have been quite a few mystery boxes that I haven't been<br/>
able to find on the first try. (There have been plenty of regular<br/>
non-mystery boxes that I haven't found on the first try!) For some,<br/>
that may be just too discouraging. Once I heard about the elusive<br/>
one from Maine, I too was hooked, and have found quite a few of his<br/>
boxes (and would enjoy more clues if anyone has them ;-).<br/>
<br/>
My take on it is, that we have quite a few passive, "recreational"<br/>
letterboxers here in CT. Now, I know what you're saying... isn't<br/>
letterboxing a recreational activity anyway????? I use that term to<br/>
mean those families who do it once in a while, who never strive to<br/>
finish a town, a county, or a state. We have quite a few<br/>
letterboxers who find a few, plant a few, then never to be heard from<br/>
again. I find that we don't have nearly as many active, diehard<br/>
letterboxers in CT... those who will find boxes on a regular basis,<br/>
those who carve their own stamps, and plant boxes on a semi-regular<br/>
basis, and while doing this, hone in on their skills as a<br/>
letterboxer. Once those few diehard letterboxers find the boxes<br/>
(with many of them having most of the boxes in the state already,<br/>
they go out almost immediately to hunt them down), then boxes get<br/>
very little activity.<br/>
<br/>
I sincerely hope that everyone goes out and plants a mystery box.<br/>
They are really fun, and very satisfying to find!!!!! As Mark would<br/>
say.... Get out there and BOX! (mystery box that is ;-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree -- finding boxes is fun, but the mystery boxes seem to provide <br/>
the greatest sense of accomplishment.  We have not done a lot of <br/>
planting yet, but the ones we are planning are going to take a least a <br/>
little bit of effort to work out the location. (Nothing along the <br/>
lines of most of the eeevil planted in the LBMA range, however -- <br/>
there is quite a tradition of difficult boxes, which only adds to the <br/>
fun of the game IMHO).  <br/>
<br/>
We are working on the theory that boxes that require a more effort to <br/>
work out the location might be better taken care of when rehiding?  <br/>
Just a thought, but we would be interested to hear if others subscribe.<br/>

As an interesting side note, we planted a mystery box in VA over a <br/>
year ago.  I don't think the clues are particularly hard, but we just <br/>
received notification today of the first finders.  I know that many <br/>
others have driven right past it on their way to other boxes.  Oh <br/>
well, at least it is still there, safe and sound!  (To the finders, we <br/>
were unable to contact you and thank you for the update because <br/>
you/LBMA didn't include your return address in the notification <br/>

  We have a pretty strong bunch of puzzle writers and solvers in LBMA. I don't want to name names as I am too afraid of leaving anyone out. But some of the clues are simply brilliant, and I am always stunned when folks solve them.<br/>

We love mystery boxes too. FWIW, we figured out the clues to this box <br/>
shortly after you planted it, but just haven't been in the area to look <br/>
for it. Glad to hear it's still there, though. Hopfully we'll get to the <br/>
area sometime...<br/>

tougher than average I hope.  I say - Viva Mystery Boxes!<br/>

<br/>
Another aspect to hard clues is that is helps to control the integrity of your box and hiding <br/>
spot. Living where I do (on Mount Desert Island Maine) we get 3 million visitors tromping <br/>
through a small space. Hard clues help to cut down on high traffic to more descreet areas. <br/>

&gt; letterboxer. Once those few diehard letterboxers find the boxes<br/>
&gt; (with many of them having most of the boxes in the state already,<br/>
&gt; they go out almost immediately to hunt them down), then boxes get<br/>
&gt; very little activity.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I sincerely hope that everyone goes out and plants a mystery box.<br/>
&gt; They are really fun, and very satisfying to find!!!!! As Mark would<br/>
&gt; say.... Get out there and BOX! (mystery box that is ;-)<br/>
