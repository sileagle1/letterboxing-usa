I can contact a few people to see if they are interested in putting a <br/>
new stamp in the box for you.  Is your letterbox near the Fireside <br/>
Motel?  I am moving back to the west coast but it wont be until <br/>
November.<br/>
If you would rather contact me through email use squad_51@msn.com <br/>
