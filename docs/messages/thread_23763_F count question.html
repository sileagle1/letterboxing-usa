<br/>
I've found several boxes that are listed only on letterboxing.org, so <br/>
I can't log them in as found on AQ.  This makes my F-count <br/>
artificially low.  I'm not about to start pestering LB.org posters to <br/>
cross-post their clues...that's up to them if they want to use both <br/>
sites.  But is there a way to log LB.org-only finds on AQ?  And vice <br/>
versa?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Funny you should mention this.  I had (out of sheer laziness and <br/>
inertia) just recorded our finds on lb.org, because it was the first <br/>
site we started to use.  Not so much to count, but just so we would <br/>
know which ones we had already looked for.<br/>
<br/>
After all this discussion, I decided to go back and log our finds <br/>
onto AQ.  And darned if many boxes (esp older ones) were not there; <br/>
or some were listed as one box when they were really multiples, <br/>
etc.  So the F-restriction is even more arbitrary than first <br/>
suspected.  Not through anyone's fault -- just sheer randomness.<br/>
