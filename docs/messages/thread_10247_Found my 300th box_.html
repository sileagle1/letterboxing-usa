<br/>
There are over 3000 historical cemeteries in Rhode Island.<br/>
<br/>
But don't despair.  There are only 39 municipalities.  The cemeteries <br/>
in each municipality are counted starting from 1.  Therefore, you <br/>
have only 39 possibilities.<br/>

&gt; &gt; OOPS, You are right.  We will eventually find the RI cemetary<br/>
&gt; &gt; I mean... how many can there be?????? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are over 3000 historical cemeteries in Rhode Island.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But don't despair.  There are only 39 municipalities.  The <br/>
cemeteries <br/>
&gt; in each municipality are counted starting from 1.  Therefore, you <br/>
&gt; have only 39 possibilities.<br/>
