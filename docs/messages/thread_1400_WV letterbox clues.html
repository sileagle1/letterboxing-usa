This is a great place to do some rock climbing. After checking out the <br/>
visitor center take the trail up to the top. There are signs along the way <br/>
explaining some of the geological features of this unique mountain, you will <br/>
want to read them I'm sure. After you pass the Den Tree go past the split <br/>
rail fence and up the stairs to read about Human History. From there look <br/>
over the sign about 6 yards and spot a large flat-top rock. Find the tree <br/>
behind that rock and look under a pile of rocks at the base for the treasure <br/>
it holds. This is a very congested area so be careful that no one sees you <br/>
retrieve and re-hide the box.  Lots of people saw me sitting there but I <br/>
don't think anyone saw me hide the letterbox.  After stamping why don't you <br/>
go on up to the top, I understand the view is fantastic.<br/>

When you get to the top just after you come around the curve stop and park in <br/>
the parking area. From there you have a great view of the mountains on one <br/>
side and the blueberry bushes on the other. From the sign in the parking lot <br/>
walk down the center of the road about 100 steps, Stop turn left and walk <br/>
about 56 steps into the field heading to the edge that looks over the road <br/>
that you drove up on.  There are some rocks there, one of which looks like a <br/>
hand with 3 fingers, palm down on the ground, if you stretch your <br/>
imagination. At the base of that rock is another to the left side. Look in a <br/>
crevice between the two for the letterbox.  You are out in the middle of a <br/>
field at this point with lots of rocks so don't give up looking.  There is a <br/>
young tree off to the left in another group of rocks. This area is a good <br/>
place to hide boxes but nearly impossible with out a compass. Good luck.<br/>
