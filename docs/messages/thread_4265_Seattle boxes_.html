Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I'm very new. Haven't even found any letterboxes yet. (: I intend to plant<br/>
one as soon as I have visited a few and gotten some ideas... Especially with<br/>
this Seattle rain, I want to see what other people use for waterproof<br/>
containers. (:<br/>
<br/>
I'm going out searching this weekend, on a run or two (I'm training for a<br/>
marathon, and letterboxing &amp; geocaching both appeal to me to keep my mind<br/>
busy on the 10+ mile runs), and thought I'd go to Lincoln Park and see if I<br/>
could find the ones Amanda put there.<br/>
<br/>
I wondered if anyone knows of any other letterboxes in the city of Seattle?<br/>
I've found the clues for the Catbird one at Discovery Park, but so far have<br/>
not found anything for any others. I'll go see if I can find that one this<br/>
weekend...<br/>
<br/>
This is just the coolest thing... I've always loved hunting for things like<br/>
this, but never knew letterboxing (or geocaching -- I'm clear on the<br/>
differences, no worries there!) existed until this week.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

There are also boxes at Cougar Mountain and Tiger Mountain out in <br/>

way. <br/>
