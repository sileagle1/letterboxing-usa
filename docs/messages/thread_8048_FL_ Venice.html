<br/>
Well, as a newbie, I went searching for my very first LB yesterday (9/28). I <br/>
guess this would be the Tortoise and the Hare's Shark's Tooth Box. I had no <br/>
trouble finding the correct location. (I'm sure of it.) But, alas, no box. <br/>
Awwwww!!!<br/>
<br/>
I've been reading the digest for about a month now waiting to get out and try <br/>
my hand at finding a LB. There aren't too many around in southwest Florida, <br/>
but my friend and I made a special trip to Venice, about 65 miles, and no <br/>
box. However, Sharkey's was a great place for lunch of a fabulous grouper <br/>
sandwich and a pitcher of suds.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to place a box sometime but I want to find at least one before I <br/>
place any, just so I can really see how its done. <br/>
