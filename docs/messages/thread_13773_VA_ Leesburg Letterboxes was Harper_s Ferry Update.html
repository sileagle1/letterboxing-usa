Gang this weekend. The trail is very squishy and once while going <br/>
downhill I slid about 3 feet before landing splat on my knees. <br/>
Somehow I remained relatively clean. <br/>
<br/>
I may get fired as the family navigator since I misinterpreted a <br/>
portion of clue 3 and we were about to give up before hubby put us on <br/>
the right path. The clues are pretty straight forward, it's my brain <br/>
that was muddled.<br/>
<br/>
All the boxes were doing great, collecting many stamps. The handmade <br/>
log books are beautiful!<br/>
<br/>
Since we were so close we decided to take a side trip to the banks of <br/>
the Potomac where we spotted a stick that wasn't a snake. In <br/>
following the clues for box 3, where it says the left path is blocked <br/>
by a large fallen tree so to go to the right, go left and climb over <br/>
the fallen trees and you will come to the river.<br/>
<br/>
We've also located the Runway 17-35 letterbox placed by Rich. Very <br/>
little walking is required to get to this box, but it is all off-<br/>
trail.<br/>
