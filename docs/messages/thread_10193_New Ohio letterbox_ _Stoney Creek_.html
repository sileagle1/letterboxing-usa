                    <div class="plaintext-content">Title: "Stoney Creek". Located in Scioto Trails State Park, Ross <br/>
County, Ohio. Placed 1-11-03 by Salamander. DIFFICULTY: MODERATE. <br/>
DRIVING DIRECTIONS: Take US Route 23 south from Chillicothe <br/>
approximately 11 miles; turn left (east) onto SR-372.This is the park <br/>
entrance.  CLUES:  Follow Route 372 approximately 0.6 mile, where <br/>
just past the fire tower, the road becomes Park Road #1. Continue on <br/>
Rd. #1 for about 2 more miles,then make a left turn onto Park Road #3 <br/>
(You will pass the park office on your right, shortly after turning <br/>
onto this road). Continue on RD.#3 until you see a log church and <br/>
campground amphitheater on your right. There is parking  nearby. Find <br/>
the monument to a local hermit near the log church. From here, take a <br/>
reading of 135 degrees and go 16 paces to a tree near the horseshoe <br/>
pits. Starting from this tree, go 28 paces up the hillside at a <br/>
heading of 83 degrees. The letterbox is hidden under the southeast <br/>
end of a fallen log. NOTE: My pace count (2 steps =1 pace) is as <br/>
precise as I could make it although it may be a bit off due to the <br/>
conditions of the slope you will be climbing; it is a bit steep in <br/>
places and even on this January day, I found myself getting tangled <br/>
up in sticker bushes almost nonstop. Good Luck!<br/>
