So, if you're chanterelling about the trail sniffing out fungus-<br/>
encrusted letterboxes, like a hen-of-the-woods, and acting a bit <br/>
suspicious, blame it on the fact that you're a 'truffle' bit <br/>
frustrated because you just can't seem to locate that bearded tooth, <br/>
shaggy mane, puffball, oyster 'shroom or the unsuspecting galerinas <br/>
you're just dying to dig up.  When all else fails and folks just <br/>
don't believe your claim, place your mushroom guide high atop the <br/>
sulphur shelf, supported by brackets, and perhaps they'll accept <br/>
your almanitas, er, I mean alibi!  I suspect some just might not <br/>
believe it, one lebIOTA!  Others, however, may actually fall for the <br/>
false morel of a sporey.  ;)<br/>

A Pacific Northwest mushroom collector actually uncovered &amp; <br/>
