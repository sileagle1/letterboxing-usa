                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, <br/>
I share your excitment about unusual finds in the letterboxes. It is really fun to find something that no one has ever mentioned. The first box that I found had something unusual about it that I have never seen since. I duplicated it in one of my boxes but to my knowledge no one has ever found that box. For some reason I did not share it with the group and I am glad that I did not. I did email the one who hid the box and was beside myself with excitement. I am glad that I did not share it with the group because it adds to the mystery and excitment of the hunt. It is a nice secret between me and the one who originally hid the box and now anyone else who has found it. <br/>
<br/>
I have pretty much stopped adding hitchikers to boxes because there are so many out there now. I do move them if I find them, I'm just not adding to the collection. Some of that thrill of finding them has gone with so many out there. <br/>
<br/>
As far as the double sided stamp goes, it just seemed logical for that particular stamp and the medium I was using to create it. It may have been the first but I doubt it. Jay was correct in assuming that it was ment to be just one letterbox and not two.<br/>
<br/>
One really nice thing about this hobbly is the endless posibility for creativity, both verbal and non verbal. And I love the surprise!. The surprise of solving a cleaver clue, the surprise of a stamp image or what ever. Surprise is fun, we could use more in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
I think my next stamp should be a high horse. I'll duplicate the one I'm getting off of now. <br/>
<br/>
May there be lots of nuts in your lives,<br/>

I agree completely, Squirrel.<br/>
<br/>
I know of a fellow boxer who found the same hitchhiker 3 times this <br/>
year, all in different locations. Let's try NOT to make them <br/>
commonplace, huh? Remember, you can have too much of a good thing. <br/>
Overdoing hitchhikers and mystery boxes can take the sparkle out of <br/>
it, IMHO.<br/>

<br/>
Or, as Ralph Nader said, "Al Gore cost me the election" :-)  95% of<br/>
the boxes listed on the LbNA web site are non-hitchhiker, non-mystery,<br/>
so perhaps it is those "normal" types of boxes which are being <br/>
overdone :-)<br/>
<br/>
As the hobby continues to mature here, I think we have the luxury of <br/>
ignoring the boxes we don't like, pretending they don't exist, and <br/>
hopefully everyone will still find enough that sparkle to their <br/>
taste ... don't let the boxes you don't like take away from the fun <br/>
of the boxes you do like ...<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, I've always maintained that a problem with hitchhikers<br/>
was all the kibitzing and tracking surrounding them.  If they had <br/>
remained a relative secret, the mystery and mystique for the finder <br/>
alone to experience in the thrill of the hunt and discovery, perhaps <br/>
people would not be jaded now.  Who knows?  They certainly would be <br/>
less common.  For all the other secrets out there now (and they are <br/>
out there, as many of you know), and those to come, preserving the <br/>
mystery and mystique can be fun, I think ... we'll see ...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Alright, alright, Randy. I KNEW I was gonna catch some flack for <br/>
that. If about 1 in every 20 boxes out there is a "hitchiker" <br/>
or "mystery", maybe that's not excessive. But then again, it's all a <br/>
matter of perspective. I STILL maintain they could become all too <br/>
common.<br/>
<br/>
You did bring up a good point when you said:<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I would say that some discretion would be nice when it comes to <br/>
discussing hitchhikers. (WE TALK TOO MUCH.)<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be almost an air of distinction to the English version <br/>
of the sport. A degree of sophistication---that we in the US are <br/>
lacking. (I'm sure I'll get jumped on for that one.) The <br/>
term "venerable" has been mentioned numerous times on this site to <br/>
describe UK letterboxing. We on this side of the pond are forging out <br/>
our own version of letterboxing. BUT: I think we could benefit from <br/>
knowing the accepted Old World rules of letterbox etiquette. We could <br/>
take some and leave others. Perhaps some input from our friend the <br/>
Moorland Wizard could enlighten us more about their customs.<br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong, but I'm guessing that the Dartmoor 'boxers don't <br/>
announce what "traveler" was found by who, where, and when and record <br/>
it in a database, do they?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Isn't it enough to know that travelers are out there somewhere just <br/>
waiting to be stumbled upon to delight some lucky letterboxer's heart?<br/>

&gt;Don't come down for too long, Squirrel.  You have great points to <br/>
make.  The creativity you and others bring to this activity is an <br/>
inspiration.  Your York River #2 box was my first found, so for me <br/>
that one will always hold a certain excitement.  I remember you told <br/>
me how special York River #1 was to you, and I'm sorry I never got to <br/>
see it.  Your advice to try to place more than one in a location has <br/>
always stuck with me.  Had you not done that at York River, I'd have <br/>
had a very disappointed Katybug with me!  I try to keep that in mind <br/>
when I'm planting boxes.  I'm hoping for some time this long weekend <br/>
to get north to add a few more of yours and the G Man's to my <br/>
journal.  BTW, Jay mentioned your fall...I hope you're elbow is <br/>
recovering well.  Be careful out there!<br/>

Well said.  I, for one, get more joy out of trying to solve, and find <br/>
(or never find :-)) _one_ mystery box, than collecting 10 "drive-by" <br/>
stamps.  On the other hand, I'm also thankful for these easier boxes <br/>
for when I'm out with the kids.  I do believe there can never be <br/>
enough mystery boxes.  (Most, I think, boxes on Dartmoor we would <br/>
consider mystery boxes, and there are tens of thousands of them, and <br/>
we have a huge nation to work with...)  There are several boxes I've <br/>
been working on (not regularly, but once in a while) for almost 2 <br/>
years now, and when I find one of those, it'll be worth more to me <br/>
than many of the easier ones.  And I also know there are some I'll <br/>
never find, but I'm having fun trying to solve the clues anyway...<br/>

I agree--hitchhikers are one thing and mystery boxes are quite <br/>
another. I'm with you -I believe that mystery boxes are a <br/>
fundamental, even essential - part of the game. My comments and <br/>
concerns regarding proliferation was really about hitchhikers, not <br/>
mystery boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently working on one of Randy's wonderful mysteries right <br/>
now. And if I solve it, I'd love to brag openly about it. But, <br/>
Webster's defines the word "decorum" as: "the conventions of polite <br/>
behavior."<br/>
<br/>
So if and when I solve that mystery box, I'll be quiet about it, <br/>
though it will probably take decorum, discretion, AND duct tape. <br/>

<br/>
Some of you all East of the Rockies have a bit of an analysis paralysis over<br/>
this hitchhiker/travelling box etiquette rules and regulations stuff.  Maybe<br/>
I'm just so fresh at this I can't help get excited and bubble over in<br/>
e-mails.  This can't be a solemn, silent sport for me!  I've got too much<br/>
enthusiasm for it. Since I've gotten involved in this hobby I have yet to<br/>
snag a hitchhiker and I'll be SO PUMPED when I do!  Out here in the Wild,<br/>
Wild West I don't think they come so easy as every five minutes in<br/>
Connecticut.  At least not so far. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...I don't know about mystery boxes.  I suspect Mapsurfer's finds are<br/>
true treasures because the clues are probably cryptic and take some thinking<br/>
and skill.  The boxes I've put out there are about as obvious as the nose on<br/>
your face.  Some would say that's not very challenging, but I'm as bad as a<br/>
kid and I get kind of disappointed if I don't find what I'm hunting for, and<br/>
for that reason my boxes are probably not much of a thrill for real<br/>
letterboxing "purists".  I'm getting better at carving the images, though,<br/>
so there's your incentive, I hope!<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to letterboxing I can't get too technical or detail-oriented.<br/>
I just want to have a good time.  That's what it's all about for me and I'd<br/>
like it to be that way for others I introduce this cool hobby to!!!<br/>
