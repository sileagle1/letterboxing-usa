<br/>
I've been hooked on letterboxing for about a year now, and just <br/>
started placing my own boxes and carving my own stamps, which I think <br/>
may almost be *more* fun than finding boxes...maybe...nah...well, at <br/>
least it gets me though the winter months.<br/>
<br/>
My question is this- (I've been searching the archives for about an <br/>
hour now, and can't find the answer, so if you all are burnt out on <br/>
this question, I'm sorry :))<br/>
<br/>
Are there any specific stores that carry bigger carving medium than <br/>
erasers?  My first two stamps, carved last night, were on crumbly <br/>
icky "general" erasers.  (So anyone who comes across my "Wandering <br/>
Lotus" hitchhiker, please keep that in mind.  The stamp will probably <br/>
fall to pieces before it leaves the state!)  I've read "speedy-cut" <br/>
and PZ-Cut, but where to find...? <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions would be great.  I've already tried Jo-Anns and <br/>
Michaels, and the workers there all looked at me like I was speaking <br/>
Mongolian.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

You might try again, although all Michael's are not created equal.<br/>

A couple of other products you may want to try are:<br/>
<br/>
Speedball SpeedyStamp - the pink stuff.  A 1/4" thick pink carving <br/>
material that can be found in the block printing section at most <br/>
Michael's and Hobby Lobby stores.  You DO NOT want the white <br/>
SpeedyCut product that they sell -- it is crumbly.<br/>
<br/>
Mastercarve - these are 5/8-3/4" thick blocks in assorted sizes from <br/>
Mars Staedler.  They carve great, but they are softer than the pink <br/>
stuff and PZ Kut, so it is a little tougher to get fine detail.  The <br/>
good thing is that this material is thick enough that you don't have <br/>
to mount it if you don't want to, and you can carve both sides.  Most <br/>
craft, hobby and rubber stamping stores carry these in either the <br/>
block printing area or the rubber stamping supplies.  They are also <br/>
available online from Dick Blick at:<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's interesting to get different peoples perspectives on things.  I <br/>
happen to love working with the white stuff.  It carves beautifully.  <br/>
After I'm finished, I cut a piece of 1/4" hobby plywood to fit the <br/>
back of the stamp and glue it on with 5 minute epoxy.  It seems to <br/>
work great.  The pink stuff is wonderfully tough and durable but I <br/>
find it to be a bit difficult to carve.  It requires very sharp tools <br/>
to get a good result.  I usually put a back on those as well.  The <br/>
Pink Pearl erasers work very well and they're stiff enough that I <br/>
don't put a back on them.  The white Mars erasers are ok too but it's <br/>
a pain to have to sand the embossing off first.  Something for <br/>
everyone!  Just my two cents worth.<br/>
