<div>"Billie Boswell Bike Path" by Gwen and 
Don</div>
<div> <span id="__#Ath#SignaturePos__"></span> Park your car near the 
creek and before Snake road in area II of El Dorado Park. Walk south to the bike 
/rollerblade/walkers path. Take the path east, then it will turn north. On 
the path north you will see a "Squat-Stretch" bench next to the concrete path. 
The letterbox is located 87 paces at 25 degrees from this spot at the base of a 
multi-trunked tree, covered with leaves and twigs. If you are having difficulty, 
look for  callbox # 605 7.When the callbox is directly east of your 
location , walk 43 paces south along the ditch, then 14 paces west of the ditch 
to the tree. Still having problems? Find the parking lot in the north-east 
section of area II. From the handicapped parking sign the letterbox is 196 paces 
at 130 degrees.Who is Billie Boswell ? We haven't a clue, nor do the folks in 
charge of El Dorado Park know who in the heck she is or was. We are researching 
and will place any info in the box when we find out. Since she obviously was 
respected sufficiently to name a bike path after her, a letterbox in her name 
next to the path should also suit her .</div></body></html>
