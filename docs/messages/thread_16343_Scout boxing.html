were carved and hidden by dvn2r skr, Fudrick, Trial and Error, Glenn <br/>
and myself. Ms Alafair sent a lovely event stamp with Patricus, who <br/>
was visiting the area on business. <br/>
<br/>
As it turns out the boxes ranged from basic skills to tougher.  We <br/>
did not agree to it, but skills in compass use, tree and plant id <br/>
came into play.  Themes were salmon and scouting, again not pre-<br/>
planned, we each did our own thing.<br/>
<br/>
Glenn's clues are just all compass bearings, mine tried to introduce <br/>
natural history and woodlore.  Held in a very small area it was <br/>
tricky trying to find hiding spots.  I found 2 boxes placed by the <br/>
others while trying to place mine.<br/>
<br/>
Now is the best time for anyone planning to visit.  The Salmon are <br/>
running thick and heavy.<br/>

&lt;&lt; The Kennedy Creek Series in Washington State was put together last <br/>
<br/>
year at this time for a Pack. . . Now is the best time for anyone planning to <br/>
visit. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sure wish I could, but it's just a tad too far from Florida!<br/>
<br/>
I was concerned that it'd be hard to find three good hiding places for my <br/>
boxes, but it turned out to be surprisingly easy.  I managed to put them all in <br/>
different areas, so the scouts weren't tripping over each other while they <br/>
searched, and yet I didn't have to hide one right in the area where we were <br/>
camping, because I KNEW if I put one there, one of the boys would find it before we <br/>
started the search!<br/>
<br/>
As it was, they pulled down the markers another leader had put out there for <br/>
his orienteering course and all the markers had to be re-placed.  :-/<br/>
