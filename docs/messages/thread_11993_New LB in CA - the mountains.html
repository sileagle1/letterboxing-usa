A BRIDGE TOO FINGERPRINTED LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Hamish MacBeth, Cousin Knuepppe and Adam Ant. <br/>
Date: April 8th, 2003 <br/>
Number of Boxes: Two (other is "PASSPORT TO THE FALLS") <br/>
City: Los Angeles <br/>
County: Los Angeles <br/>
State: California <br/>
Place: Angeles National Forest Bridge/Overpass (other is at Switzer Falls) <br/>
Terrain Difficulty: Easy <br/>
Status: Alive <br/>
1.) There is a tunnel right after a brown sign that says 'Bighorn Sheep Area Next 1 Mile' and a picture of binoculars. <br/>
2.) Pull over to the right and look at that mountanious view. Get out of the car and make your way to the bridge. <br/>
3.) Climb to behind/on top of the overpass, hugging the concrete wall for support. Go all the way to the end. <br/>
4.) There is a green bush - get behind it. (Careful if you go on the overpass to do so.) <br/>
5.) Face the double yellow line down on the road. In the bush, a tiny bit to the right is a plastic bag containing the letterbox under some rocks. (Careful of the sharp branches.) <br/>
6.) Please make sure you put a heavy rock back on it when you're through stamping up due to possible high winds. Yeah! Now enjoy that view!!! <br/>
Up here it's easy to be discrete!! <br/>
Happy Hunting!! <br/>
