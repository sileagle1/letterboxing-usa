Salisbury Greenway Park<br/>
Salisbury, N.C. <br/>
Rowan County<br/>
placed on 3/1/03 by GEMINI<br/>
<br/>
 ==============<br/>
The following clues can be found at<br/>
http://fictionwriter.tripod.com/letterboxing.htm <br/>
 ==============<br/>
<br/>
   The Salisbury Greenway Park is a magical place, full of strange and<br/>
mysterious creatures. Sadly, our unfortunate Frog Prince is imprisoned<br/>
somewhere in the park and under an awful spell. Find him and free him<br/>
from his prison and the awful spell!<br/>
<br/>
   1. Park at Overton Elementary School and enter the Greenway from<br/>
there. Follow the paved path until you get to the covered foot-bridge.<br/>
Don't cross the bridge because there's a terrible, ugly, one-eyed<br/>
troll living underneath. If he hears you crossing his bridge, he'll<br/>
come out and get you!<br/>
   2. At the entrance to the Troll's bridge, turn right and look east<br/>
into the field. There is a tall man-hole standing in the field, go to<br/>
it and look closely at the cover where you will find a Magic Number.<br/>
   3. Stand beside the Magic Number and take your first compass<br/>
bearing. The bearing you want is 40 plus the Magic Number. Take 68<br/>
long steps (34 paces) and you will find a small pile of rocks.<br/>
Approach the rocks quietly so you won't disturb the family of Gnomes<br/>
that live underneath.<br/>
   4. At the Gnome's home, you will take another compass bearing. The<br/>
new bearing is 3 times the Magic Number PLUS the "Unlucky Number" (The<br/>
day was truly an unlucky one when our poor Prince was turned into a<br/>
frog!).<br/>
   5. Following your new bearing, take 20 steps (10 paces) then stop.<br/>
You will find our Frog Prince to your left, under a rock. If you<br/>
brought a damsel with you, be sure she kisses the frog to free<br/>
him from his spell!<br/>
   6. After you finish stamping in, please be careful to repack the<br/>
letterbox and hide it well. <br/>
