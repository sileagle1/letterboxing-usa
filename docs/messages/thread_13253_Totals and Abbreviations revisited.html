I put all mine in one big sketch book leaving room to jot down notes <br/>

Abbreviations: I understand the basics (above) but what would be<br/>
some of the others I have seen listed?  I know these can be <br/>
individualized. I guess I was hoping people would share their ideas <br/>
or thoughts on this.  <br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of keeping track of the attempts or tries vs the <br/>
actual finds. Then thought that this might not be good as some lbs go <br/>
missing....<br/>
<br/>
Also I guess G could be gatherings attended. Please share your <br/>
abbreviations. Could there be a file made of these for newbies?<br/>

Wow! I'm impressed!  I hope to up my found count when my youngest <br/>
goes into school next September.  Anyhow, I'll share my <br/>
interpretations of my abbreviations:<br/>
<br/>
P8 A1 L1 R1 F25 HH14 E4 X90<br/>
<br/>
P = placed<br/>
A = adopted<br/>
L = lost<br/>
R = retired<br/>
F = found<br/>
HH= hitchhiker<br/>
E = event<br/>
X = exchange<br/>
<br/>
If I were to start counting attempts, I'd probably have to use T for <br/>
Tried.  Or minus F ( -F ) for attempted, but not found.  The fun <br/>
thing about this hobby is that you can make up your own rules as you <br/>
go along!<br/>

I now know what yours mean. Can't we have a poll and a consensus?<br/>
<br/>
Do you really have 90 exchanges? WOW!!<br/>

You'll note the 4 event stamps.  LOTS of letterboxers show up for <br/>
letterboxing events.<br/>
<br/>
And as far as getting a poll and consensus going, well, as I <br/>
mentioned before, I have found in my experience (and I'm only talking <br/>
about my experience) is that part of the fun of letterboxing is that <br/>
there really is only One Prime Directive : Leave No Trace.  All the <br/>
rest everyone sort of makes up as they go along.  I have quirky <br/>
rules - I routinely maintain my letterboxes.  When I do so, if I <br/>
catch another letterboxer "in the act", I have a special stamp on me <br/>
just for that.  I have another stamp at my house in case a fellow <br/>
letterboxer drops by.  I have one letterbox that is both a letterbox <br/>
and a cache but it is not a geocache.  I dunno - I just make up <br/>
things as I go along.  Makes things fun.<br/>
