<br/>
Anyone that has not already RSVP'd and is interested in joining us October 26th for a wonderful day of lettergboxing please do so by tonight.  Of course if there are stragglers that do rsvp after tonight, I will not refuse them. <br/>
<br/>
**PLEASE use the database here to post what dish/items you are planning on bringing with you.**<br/>
<br/>
I will email everyone tonight with probably the last update until the gathering itself.  Until then, happy letterboxing to all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope to hear from you soon,<br/>

I've debated it seriously, and as much as I want to, I don't think we'll make it.  I've got to go out to the end of Long Island Friday, Northern CT on Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
Alas, we miss another.<br/>
