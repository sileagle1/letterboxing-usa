                    <div class="plaintext-content">You guys are so prepared, I'm impressed. I am lucky if I remember my stamp <br/>
book. I carved the Riverside stamp on the spot and then forgot to stamp it <br/>
into my own book because I didn't have my book with me. Fortunately Jay C. <br/>
found the stamp and sent me a copy of my own stamp. I do carry a compass but <br/>
rarely use it, what I really need are legs as long as the Jays to find their <br/>
boxes. In California I forgot the boxes and only had the stamps. Hid them <br/>
anyway. Again someone was nice enough to provide a box for the Mt. Baldy box. <br/>
Thank you all who have reparied and replaced boxes for me. I have a couple of <br/>
boxes out there that don't have clues. Go figure?  What I would really like <br/>
to have in my pack is time, time to go to Virginia and look for all those <br/>
great boxes down there and enjoy their southern hospitality. <br/>
<br/>
I hope when ya'll visit the capital city that you take time to hide a box or <br/>
two.  You can pretend you are secret agents on a mission and be real clever <br/>
and try to hide them where I can't find them.  Yes, that is a challenge.<br/>
<br/>
May there be lots of nuts in your life,<br/>
Squirrel<br/>

p.s.<br/>
Thanks for the update on the Riverside clues. Who knew they would move the <br/>
tables. Lets hope they don't move  Roosevelt's statue next. <br/>
