things you see when you work the late shifts :)  I worked at Cheesequake<br/>
though, and the one that always bugged us was that people thought we sold<br/>
cheesecake, so they'd keep bugging you asking for cheesecake, insisting we<br/>
must have it somewhere?!?<br/>
But, since you've made it that far, why haven't I seen any Drew clan stamps at<br/>
my boxes yet?  I can't guarantee that the Liberty one is still there after<br/>
this weekend, but there's still others, but the scenery is nothing compared to<br/>
the rest stops :)<br/>

We've been tossing around the interstate letterbox idea ourselves <br/>
(must be vibes!). It sounds a little weird to admit it, but we've <br/>
stopped at the Vince Lombardi rest stop in one of New Jersey's more <br/>
scenic areas so many times it's like a family tradition. My eldest <br/>
will never forget the site of her first transgender in the ladies' <br/>
room there....so now it's official. Next time down the NJTP we're <br/>
planting something rubbery at the Vince. <br/>
