We looked for your Bean Box yesterday to no avail.  Found the spot, the<br/>
rocks, etc., but no box.  You might want to check it next time you're in<br/>
the area.<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
----------------<br/>
Probably won't get to it until next year!    Maybe their is some LBer who<br/>
could substitute one for it? Is that allowed????<br/>
<br/>
Any stamp will do...better one than none....don't what to spoil anybodys<br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on this one?<br/>

<br/>
I can ask them to check on it for you.<br/>

(By the way, these friends learned about letterboxing when we visited them on 8/6.  We got them addicted too!)<br/>

I can confirm that it was there on 8/16/05, when we visited it.  It <br/>
was NOT under the 5th rock from either end--we also poked around the <br/>
other rocks and got it, replacing it where found.<br/>
