                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm happy to report success with my Webelos Scouts and letterboxing at our <br/>
campout this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
I hastily planted 3 boxes when I arrived at the park, and scribbled clues, <br/>
while supervising my son who was erecting our tent.  (Place a box, run back, <br/>
check on kid, Place a box, run back . . . you get the idea)<br/>
<br/>
We had 7 scouts there (plus one sibling who crossed over to Boy Scouts last <br/>
year).  A couple of them even remembered to bring the stamps they carved two <br/>
weeks ago!  Anyway, we split them in to three groups, gave each group a set of <br/>
clues and a leader or two, and sent them on their way.  When they all came back <br/>
(within seconds of each other--it was a beautiful thing) we switched clues <br/>
and sent them back out again.<br/>
<br/>
The leaders who went with them said the boys enjoyed it--and no one was <br/>
groaning, "Oh no, we have to find ANOTHER one?" when I gave them the next set of <br/>
clues, so I guess it's true.  Those same leaders have decided I should do this <br/>
for every campout.  I told them "We'll see."<br/>
<br/>
In other news, I placed my first "real" (as in, not just for a Cub Scout <br/>
campout) box last month, and today I got an email from a very nice geocacher who <br/>
said she (or he--hard to tell from the name) found it by accident while <br/>
geocaching, signed in, and hid it just the way it was.  But the best news was, she <br/>
(or he) said there were already 2 or 3 stamps in it!  I'm so excited!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Maybe, if we keep at it, we can get letterboxing made into a badge or a <br/>
belt loop! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Or at least it could be one of the items on the Map and Compass belt loop.  I <br/>
made sure all my boxes required reading a compass.<br/>
<br/>
And I followed Dogscouts' example and used "quiz" questions in the clues.  <br/>
"Which hand do Boy Scouts use to shake hands with other Boy Scouts?  Turn in <br/>
that direction."<br/>
<br/>
Or: "Take a compass reading of __X__degrees.  (to determine the number answer <br/>
this question:  Which of the following is *not* a type of fire-lay?  A.) Tee <br/>
Pee  _15_ degrees  B.) Fire-stick, ___ 278 degrees  C.) Starburst, _180_ <br/>
degrees."  They had their handbooks and their leaders with them, in case they got <br/>
stuck on the answers.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, it worked!<br/>

<br/>
Well, I ordered letterboxing patches for all my boys who letterboxed.  Not <br/>
official BSA badges, but they can wear them on their patch vest and show the <br/>
world they're letterboxers.<br/>
