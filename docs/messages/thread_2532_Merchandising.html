but If you go with CafePress your getting hammered on price. This<br/>
unfortunately is rather self serving but I own a company which<br/>
will do it for less. We also do decals, mugs, bumber stickers, large <br/>
format printing, signs,magnetic signs, banners vinyl work etc. In <br/>
short, graphics is our living.We sent an Email to Der Mad Stamper<br/>
and didn't get any response. Since the copyright for the logo seems<br/>
to belong to him, we thought that was the appropriate path before <br/>
airing the issue for all concerned. For anyone who is interested in<br/>
evaluating who we are or what we do, I invite you to go to<br/>
MoonlightMedia.Net . Whoever the right contact is, If you have an <br/>
interest, please contact us.<br/>

In addition to the above, we recently discovered this hobby and<br/>
are having a lot of fun and getting some great exercise.<br/>
