We had not thought of a theme yet, so Earth Day sounds good to us, if <br/>

perhaps we can still work together or even plan two events, depending <br/>

We were out 'boxing most of Saturday, and wish we had spent more time <br/>

&gt;    I'll add my thanks to Trish and everyone elso who made this event <br/>
so much <br/>
&gt; fun (I especially liked the wet maccarroni from Cowboy!). I wish I <br/>
could have <br/>
&gt; stayed until the end. I got my pictures done yesterday, and they <br/>
came out <br/>
&gt; great. I wish I had taken more. Trish, should we send pictures to <br/>
you to post <br/>
&gt; on the gathering web site?<br/>

&gt;   I have some ideas for a spring gathering associated with earth <br/>
