The box had been placed in its cache sideways, so<br/>
that water ran in along the seal. (In general it seems that <br/>
the rubbermaid boxes with the cream covers do not seal well.) <br/>
The logbook  was already moldy. I dried out  the box as much <br/>
as possible and replaced it in such a way to keep water off <br/>
it as much as possible. The other Belmont box, Beaver Brook,  <br/>
was ok.<br/>
