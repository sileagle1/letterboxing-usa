<br/>
Thanks for posting my letterboxes. I'm sure it's<br/>
extremely boring. Thank you again. Is an attachment<br/>
easier for you? Or should I type my clues into my<br/>
email? What helps you out? This one is an attachment.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
John <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great, John! We've been wanting for ages to get to the famous Zoar <br/>
Trail and haven't made the time. Makes you wonder just how many parks <br/>
and trail this tiny little state (CT) has, don't it? I think we're <br/>
pushing near 500 letterboxes...<br/>
<br/>
As far as attachements vs cut-and-pasting into an email, you can do <br/>
either. I have to admit that it's much easier for me to have them not <br/>
attached, and especially not in attached Word documents, as my tired <br/>
old computer is prone to hiccuping and crashing every time it sees <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
By far the easiest format is the one that Funhog uses: text in an <br/>
email that starts with "on 3/29 Funhog planted the Really Cool <br/>
Letterbox in Town-County-State." I can swipe one of those off in <br/>
about 10 seconds. Thanks, Funhog!!!<br/>
<br/>
But officially, post 'em any way you like, and post often!<br/>

I would recommend plain text (e.g. text e-mail), unless you need the<br/>
formatting of a particular document type.<br/>
<br/>
The negatives of sending a MS word file, IMO, outweigh the positives -<br/>
<br/>
a) they are huge, when the amount of information they contain is<br/>
small.  It is a bandwidth waste to send them around the 'net.<br/>
<br/>
b) some people cannot read them<br/>
<br/>
c) some people won't read them when received on the 'net (for fear of <br/>
viruses).  (I'm in that category, so if you want me to read them,<br/>
send them as plain text)<br/>
<br/>
The positives -<br/>
<br/>
a) well, I'm sure they exist ...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Randy<br/>

PS (as an aside, I won't read e-mail sent as html only either, too much<br/>
potental for scripts, web bugs, graphics downloads, and other nonsense, <br/>
so if you want me to read your e-mail, configure your mailer to at <br/>
least include a plain text version (most versions of AOL do this <br/>
automatically, but some mailers (particularily those used by spammers, <br/>
send html only, so my html filter doubles as a spam filter :-); unfortunately<br/>
I occasionally miss some otherwise insightful commentary this way ...)<br/>
