"Eric Mings" <elm@letterboxing.com> in full without selective editing.<br/>

&gt; Glenn wrote in part:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Like I said, I don't want my clues on the 100% OPEN axe to grind<br/>
letterbox<br/>
&gt; &gt;site. I sure hope others see the light too. No reason for the duplicity<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt;no reason to support a page that can only claim possible innovation and<br/>
&gt; &gt;choices but no examples of what they mean. Grind away!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Glenn, no clues will be included on the site without the permission<br/>
&gt; of the clue owners. As Randy has suggested, any hostile comments you<br/>
&gt; have are welcome to come to me directly, but I won't discuss it on<br/>
&gt; the list except<br/>
<br/>
You are good with exceptions Eric. You always have one.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; to clear up a misconceptions such as you had that I<br/>
&gt; would include your clues without permission.<br/>
<br/>
I never implied any such thing.  You haven't clearly stated what your site<br/>
is really about other than your 100% open remark. Nothing new, nothing<br/>
different just 100% open. All I asked is you not put my clues on your site.<br/>
What you want to make out of it is your drama.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I will post information<br/>
&gt; periodically about the project just as I would expect (and<br/>
&gt; appreciate) anyone else to do regarding other letterboxing projects.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have the right to reply? That is what this is all about. I think<br/>
your site/list idea SUCKS! You and your pals don't care to hear it. Not very<br/>
open are you.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Obviously you have hostility towards me but I still wish you the best.<br/>
<br/>
You are a pompous prick Eric. If you were such a wonderful guy wishing all<br/>
well you would have E-MAILED me when I first posted. Instead you ignore it.<br/>
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN 100% OPEN ABOUT ANYTHING. This is not just my opinion, it<br/>
just seems others don't want to speak out publicly.<br/>
<br/>
My hostility is proportional to you drama queen hypocrisy. You already<br/>
failed the first 100% challenge.<br/>
<br/>

Randy - Do what you feel is necessary. I am through but feel that I had a<br/>
right to speak my mind if Eric and Company do the same. Eric made the choice<br/>
to discuss his list/website on this list and I replied. I received no E-mail<br/>
complaints but I did receive 3 that agreed with me and 1 neutral wondering<br/>
what was happening.<br/>

If there is a need for Eric's website then time will tell.  He can <br/>
expend all the effort he wants but if no one is interested then it <br/>
will get few hits and I doubt that he will continue it.  If it fills <br/>
a need that isn't being met by letterboxing.org then it will thrive.  <br/>
<br/>
In any event some of us need to chill out and let time provide the <br/>
answer.<br/>
