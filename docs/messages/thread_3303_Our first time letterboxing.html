<div>Hello, I've just found out about letterboxing from 
a friend in England, and went my family and I went out on our first 
expedition.  Unfortunately, we didn't find anything, though we scoured the 
area.  We were looking for both the Crown Point box and the Fort 
Ticonderoga box, both in upstate New York, at the southern end of Lake 
Champlain.  Has anyone found them recently?  Did we just not find 
them?  Or could they be missing.  This seems like a facinating hobby, 
and one we're interested in.  Thanks for your help!  Chris

<div>Hi Chris,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Fort Ticonderoga box was relocated in July this 
year. I would hope it is still in place and that you had the clues that have 
been posted at our site since that time. I can't tell you if the Crown Point box 
is in place - it was a year ago but that is the last I know. It has proved to be 
a hard one to find.</div>

<div>Best,</div>
