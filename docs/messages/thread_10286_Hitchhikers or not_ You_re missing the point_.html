Letterboxer Purple Heart argument. What was accomplished there. A good man felt 
put down for making and naming a box. Remember the arguements about people 
listing their PFX counts? Some people like to see it some people don't. Let

<br/>
Sure it is!  If someone is hiding stuff for people (like me) to find, <br/>
they might want to know what those people (such as myself) WANT to <br/>
find.  Most people who hide letterboxes want to make the experience <br/>
as good as possible for the people that find them.  How can someone <br/>
create a fantastic box that everyone loves if nobody is willing to <br/>
provide feedback or discuss issues such as hitchhikers, hybrids, etc?<br/>
<br/>
Some people can be very closed-minded and say, "I'm hiding whatever I <br/>
want whether you like it or not," and I guess they have every right <br/>
to do so if they want, but if you want to hide a box that others will <br/>
enjoy, it's not a bad idea to hear what others do or do not want.<br/>
<br/>
Based on the feedback from the hitchhiker discussion, it seems some <br/>
parts of the country have a severe lack of them while others have an <br/>
over-abundance!  What's come of this?<br/>
<br/>
* There's talk about "moving" HHs from over-populated areas to under-<br/>
served ones.  That will please people from BOTH sides of the equation!<br/>
<br/>
* Perhaps some people were planning to create a multitude of <br/>
hitchhikers but now realizes that many people in their area may not <br/>
appreciate the efforts as much as they wanted, and will now convert <br/>
them into regular letterboxes.  More people will enjoy the boxes, and <br/>
the hider will enjoy them more knowing more people are enjoying them!<br/>
<br/>
* Even if someone still decides to hide a hitchhiker, at least <br/>
they'll have a better idea of the reception it might receive BEFORE <br/>
they actually place it.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, everyone will be theoretically happier--both the people <br/>
finding the boxes and the people placing them, and the world will be <br/>
a better place.<br/>
<br/>
Sappy, I know, but I don't think any points are being missed.  I'd <br/>
even dare to suggest that discussions like this are a HEALTHY part of <br/>
ALL group activities.  Some people don't feel comfortable about such <br/>
discussions, and sometimes they can even resort to name-calling or <br/>
worse, but in the end I think it'll make the hobby more enjoyable for <br/>
everyone to know what others are thinking.<br/>

Also, if you start posting more than a few posts in a day, you'll <br/>
begin to annoy people. Perhaps all of your 30 posts yesterday are <br/>
inciteful, witty, and full of useful and interesting information, but <br/>
I can assure you that most people aren't impressed. It's a busy board <br/>
and few people have time to read ALL posts. If you start posting <br/>
countless posts every day, people will start ignoring them. They <br/>
don't have time for it.<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Chuck and Molly,
</p><p>Everything you wrote is perfectly valid, but I would like to mention that I can sympathize with the disappointment that might be felt by people whose region is saturated with hitch-hikers.  Having found two HH in 38 boxes, I know what a rush it was to find them, and it would be kind of sad if that thrill were diminished by finding them all the time.  That's not to say people shouldn't keep placing them, and I do take issue with the classification of HH's as the "lazy man's' boxes," especially since the two I found were both exquisitely carved with beautiful handmade log books (hooray, ADG and especially Sarah!).  But if they became commonplace, frankly, I'd be bummed.  It would be my own problem, but I might want to mention it here and share my feelings.
</p><p>Now that positive suggestions have been made regarding sending HH's to other areas, I'm curious if those of you who have become more bored with them are planning the NEXT GREAT innovation in letterboxing.  I know we were very excited to find our first microbox in downtown Washington, DC, and since then have found and placed several others, and we have also found one Cuckoo...the box stays in one place, but the clues travel...now THAT was cool.  So what new, exciting things are coming next?
