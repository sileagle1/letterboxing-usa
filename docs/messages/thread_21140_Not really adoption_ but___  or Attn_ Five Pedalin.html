How does one handle the following situation. Her Ladyship took her<br/>
nephew (whom she gifted with a letterboxing kit) to a letterbox near<br/>
her ancestral home. Being a remote country estate there was only one<br/>
box nearby. This box was listed on the old LBNA site but was never<br/>
transfered to the new site. The box is alive and well and in an<br/>
absolutely gorgeous spot. No one has logged in since her Ladyship,<br/>
presumedly because it is no longer listed. A search of placers on the<br/>
LBNA site failed to reveal the placer of this box. Should her Ladyship<br/>
list it on the new LBNA site on behalf of the placer and leave it at<br/>
that, or if the placer is no longer active should she adopt it<br/>
outright. Dearest Darlingest Em doesn't cover this subject in her<br/>
quaint little book.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Not really adoption, but... or Attn; Five Pedaling Rink Rat<br/>
<br/>
Dearest Know-it-Alls,<br/>
<br/>
A search of placers on the  LBNA site failed to reveal the placer of this<br/>
box. Should her Ladyship<br/>
list it on the new LBNA site on behalf of the placer and leave it at  that,<br/>
or if the placer is no longer active should she adopt it  outright.<br/>
LP<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I ran into a similar situation last year, I emailed the webmaster of<br/>
the LBNA site.  Here is what I was told:<br/>
=======<br/>
After more than six months listing on the new site all unclaimed boxes were<br/>
transferred to a yahoogroup site for safekeeping. If you would like to adopt<br/>
the box and list it on the LbNA site then feel free to do so. I would<br/>
recommend that you include words in the clues to the effect that you are<br/>
just adopting the box while waiting for the original owner to reclaim it.<br/>
=======<br/>
<br/>
I did then list the box, with some wording to the effect that if the<br/>
original placers (or someone who actually lived nearby, since it was a box<br/>
in Hawaii) would like to take ownership, that they should contact me.  I'm<br/>
glad I resurrected it, since I have gotten messages that other people have<br/>
found it since it was relisted and some have volunteered to do any needed<br/>
maintenance when they visited.<br/>

 I've found Emily's book rarely covers letterboxing etiquette needs! <br/>
<br/>
I know this is probably a newbie question, but may I please ask.....<br/>
What is the name of Emily's book?  I have Randy's, but I didn't know <br/>
about this one.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
