Virginia is for Lovers has been set free on 8-4-02 by the Ultimate <br/>
Syndicate somewhere in northern Virginia... <br/>
<br/>
The World's Smallest Hitchhiker was found in Stafford, Va., and was <br/>
dropped off later that day... but no where near where we found it.<br/>
<br/>
We added 7 stamps into our notebook yesterday. We were able to locate <br/>
Blue Heron and the Kenmore Confederate Cemetary boxes, both in great <br/>
locations. And as the sun baked us in our car, we hunted down and <br/>
found the Scrabble Mystery Boxes (well, most of them) and G-man's Be <br/>
Prepared box. It was a fun-filled, well spent day with the whole <br/>
family. <br/>
