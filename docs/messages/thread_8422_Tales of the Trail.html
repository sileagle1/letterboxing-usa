I just looked at them saying nothing, pulling on Molly's leash. They walked by quickly and avoided eye contact.  They don't know that Molly just wants to be with them.

I would think chaffing would be too horrible to bother with, besides, <br/>
without any sort of "support" i would think even small busted ladies would <br/>
get a little tired of the constant bouncing.<br/>
<br/>
Although, i do know women who will occasionally venture out in bikinis when <br/>
they know a nice swimming hole is at the end of the day hike.<br/>

That's pretty wild.  I've never run across any naked hikers before <br/>
(only naked ducks, geese, bald eagles, caterpillars and river <br/>
otters) while letterboxing (or during any other outdoor activity).  <br/>
We even saw a box turtle in hiding in Bowie, MD yesterday--but I'm <br/>
not sure if you'd considered him dressed or naked since he had his <br/>
house on his back!  <br/>
