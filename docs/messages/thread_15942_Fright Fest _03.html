Come one, come all!  Team Rayvenhaus is planning the Fright Fest '03 Gathering for Oct 25th, 2003, the Saturday before Halloween, from 10:00am till 2:00 pm (or later, the park doesn't close till 1/2 hour after sunset), at Wapato Park in Tacoma, Wa.  We are carving the Event Stamp, the Monster Mash stamp, which is a rare picture of the Crypt Keeper 5 band of some fame.  We are also setting a series of stamps for the event, and will not be publishing the clues before hand, with a bonus stamp for those that successfully find the others in the series. All of the stamps we are going to carve will be of a frightful nature, and I'm not referring to the carving ability of either of us when I say that.  (Grin)  <br/>
<br/>
What I would like to also offer is for any one who can not make it to this gathering, to go ahead and carve up a stamp, make a box and ship it to us and we'll plant and maintain it, listing you as the creator of that box.  If you'd like to take us up on this, contact RayvenMom at rayvenmom@myndworx.com and she'll give you the snail mail address to send it to.  We're also planning the premier release of our newest Hitchhiker, the Voyager.<br/>
<br/>
I invite everyone that can make it to come and join us, meet the people behind the posts. This is a pot luck dinner, bring a covered dish, a salad, something to eat, enough for your group and we'll provide the burgers once again, along with the chips.  Along with the burger fixings. Buns, Mayo, Ketchup and Mustard.  Please give us a simple RSVP to RayvenMom, Myself at rayvenhuas@myndworx.com or here on the mailing list so I know how many burgers I'm gonna burn, I mean cook!<br/>
<br/>
Bring your own soda's or whatever, (minus alcohol of course, this is a dry park) to drink<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing everyone there!<br/>

We really don't do the 'Halloween' thing either. We're not going to dress in<br/>
costume or anything like that at all.  We're just planning a themed event,<br/>
but that's not a requirement to participate at all, I'm just looking for<br/>
subject matter to carve......  Wait till you see the Rayvenhaus Star Trek<br/>
series of Federation Pins and the Ships.  So, to take a break, we've decided<br/>
to carve the Event stamp as a Halloween theme, but aren't sure what the<br/>
others will end up like.<br/>

Just a reminder to let you know that 'The PNWLb Fright Fest '03' is gearing up to be a frightfully awesome event, if I may say so myself!!! <br/>
<br/>
(We've included the PNWLb in the name as there is another Fright Fest in this area, at Wild Waves and we didn't want to overstep into copyright areas, so, 'The PNWLb Fright Fest '03' was born!)<br/>
<br/>
We've got more boxes that you can shake a black cat at.  We've received 1 from ScoutDogs and 1 from Chuck Straub, both incredible stamps.  We've got three from Fudrick and we've got 6 of our own.  We've got, of course, the Event Stamp, which I do believe is a fairly good stamp, themed of course. And last, but not least, we have at least one hitchhiker to be released on that day.  You'll witness the inaugural flight of the USS Voyager as she starts off on her maiden voyage.<br/>
<br/>
There's a rumor that, although the Crypt Kicker 5 has recently had a breakup and is now the Crypt Kicker 5(-2), we could still have a stamp by them to include, though, with the legalities surrounding the rumored breakup, one never knows.<br/>
<br/>
Rayvenhaus is providing the Burgers and the burger fixings, along with a big bowl of Watergate Salad, provided by RayvenGranny!  Everyone needs to bring a covered dish of some sort and drinks for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The park is Kid friendly and there is a play area, so don't worry about that, the RayvenKids will be there playing.<br/>
<br/>
And let us NOT forget the raffle!  Oh yes, the PNWLb raffle of The Official PNWLb Supplies Box. We've received enough supplies to create 5 boxes with, and we'll be raffling them off to everyone that attends. The contents are as follows:  1 4x6 sheet of 'Pink Stuff', 5 containers, 5 pens, 5 notebooks, 5 Ziploc bags (lg), 5 Ziploc bags (sm), First Finder Award sheets, 'About Letterboxing' sheets, 2 2x3 wooden backs and 3 2x2 wooden backs. All in all, everything needed to create and place 5 Letterboxes! And one lucky attendee will get it all!<br/>
<br/>
We look forward to seeing everyone there!<br/>
<br/>

RayvenDad<br/>
RayvenMom<br/>

Chuck<br/>
Tish<br/>
Cami<br/>
Willow<br/>
Starfish<br/>
John and Lucy<br/>
Campfire Lady<br/>
pandora{HIB}<br/>
<br/>
(For a total of 22 people there not counting kids.)<br/>
(If I forgot anyone I am truly sorry, please let me know and I will amend the count.)<br/>
(This is only a partial list I believe, built from the raffle tickets, we learned a lot about what works and what doesn't work at a gathering.)<br/>
<br/>
Zorro won the raffle of enough supplies to make 5 boxes with and a slab of the 'Pink Stuff' along with 3 handmade logbooks by Cami (Thanks so much Cami for brining those!)<br/>
<br/>
We arrived at the site, supplies in one hand and Starbucks in the other, about 15 minutes early.  We set up on pavilion side of the main area, under the trees and started looking around. We noticed a group of people sitting at a bench and it looked suspiciously like letterboxers as they were all huddled around books on a picnic table. As we walked over, we wondered if they were letterboxers arriving early. We saw one woman raise something to her lips and make the classic 'HUFF' that a letterboxer does before stamping. RayvenMom and I looked at each other and said, "Yep, they're letterboxers!"  We walked over and recognized Sleepy Whippet and introduced ourselves to her and Bookworm along with Celt and Marcus and her boys. We brought everyone over to the main area and people started to trickle in... Within an hour or so, we had a big group and the stamping as proceeding in full frenzy.  RayvenMom was kinda sorta coordinating the exchanges, travelers and hitchhikers that had made it to the event.   Team Chaos brought a total of 22 boxes with them, I do believe, we had  4 boxes that were not hidden in the park, along with the Event Stamp.  There were 12 boxes hidden in time for the event.<br/>
<br/>
I started cooking at approx noon and people were off and running, taking the clues in hand for the park. Rayvenhaus had hidden 6 boxes of own design and had a limited edition stamp as a bonus. If you found all 6 of them, you got the bonus stamp as well!<br/>
<br/>
As the food started coming off the grill, people were talking, sharing as well as coming and going, searching for boxes.  It was a blast to see people come back to the event site to grab a bite to eat before heading back out to search for more boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I sat there, trying to ensure that everyone got fed, that conversation was flowing, that clues were handed out, that everyone was having as good as a time that I could make.<br/>
<br/>
The day went on, people started returning for boxing, some with all, some missing a few... Hints were given and those headed back out almost immediately.  The grill was fired up again and the remaining stocks of burgers and such were quickly consumed, mainly by assorted rug rats... (Are we sure they were all kids with people at the event or did some loose ones float in from around the park? (grin)).<br/>
<br/>
People started to drift away, in ones and twos as the day progressed on and before we knew it, dusk was on us as we were packing up the camp, waiting on the last pair of boxers in the park.  One box got damaged when it's hiding place was dropped on it so I went to pull it, to repair/replace it and we waited for the last group to finish.  They came up then and got their Limited Edition stamp just as I returned with the damaged box and we said good by and let the park, 8 hours later!<br/>
<br/>
I really do want to thank everyone, that came and joined in. It was so nice to place faces to the stamps we've seen on the trails.  Meeting people we've never heard of, but who decided to come anyway was an incredible blast! Being able to laugh and talk was a joy. Being able to poke fun at myself and wear the 'Control Freak' badge was a blast as well.<br/>
<br/>
Just let me make this clear.... With out each and everyone of you folks, this event would have been very, very boring.  Each of you was the reason that we decided to host this event and the reason that we are hosting Boxapalooza in 6 months time.<br/>
<br/>
Again, a heartfelt thanks to one and all.<br/>
