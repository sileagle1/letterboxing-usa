I did a stupid thing and didn't check Wanda and Pete's page to see if<br/>
there was a hitchhiker by the same name before I launched one at this<br/>
event. Well, it turns out there is (they say hindsight is 20/20). Now<br/>
I need your help getting in touch with the person who picked it up. I<br/>
need them to change the name on the cover to "Maine Snowflake" so the<br/>
two don't get confused when people are reporting them. Please let me<br/>
know if you picked it up or if you know who did. Thanks!<br/>
