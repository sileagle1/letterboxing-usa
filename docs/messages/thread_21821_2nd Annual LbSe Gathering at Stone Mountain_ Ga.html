Greetings All:<br/>
<br/>
 I just wanted everyone to know the 2nd Annual LbSe Gathering has been <br/>
planned for Saturday July 9th, 2005! From 9am to 3pm at Stone <br/>
Mountain, Ga. We hope everyone will be able to attend that wants to <br/>
and we look forward to seeing new and old friend for a day of fun &amp; <br/>
fellowship. <br/>
<br/>
 If you are attending you may sign up on Atlas Quest and also print <br/>
your own clues from either AQ or Letterboxing.org.  Should anyone have <br/>
any questions or concerns please contact me directly at <br/>
MistyMountainLdy@yahoo.com  <br/>
<br/>
  Thanks and we hope to see YOU there!<br/>
