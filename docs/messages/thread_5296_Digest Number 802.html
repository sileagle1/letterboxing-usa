litterers.  This misinformation is created when people describe geocaching<br/>
and compare it to a treasure hunt, creating the image of  something buried.<br/>
I  recently switched from letterboxing to geocaching, and I have yet to find<br/>
a cache buried in a hole.  I have come across caches in areas I consider<br/>
inappropriate but I think the same can be said for some letterboxes.  Most<br/>
seem to be place by tenderfoot cachers/boxers.  We have to work together<br/>
........  We are fighting the same fight.<br/>
<br/>
Please take a few minutes and go to the geocaching site to see what these<br/>
folks are about.<br/>

&gt; Subject: national park service position<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; the national park service's apparently official stance<br/>
&gt; on the subject of letterboxing (which they discovered<br/>
&gt; while investigating those hole-digging geocachers, it<br/>
&gt; seems) is a little discouraging to me!  is this likely<br/>
&gt; to be the position of other caretakers of our public<br/>
&gt; land (where most lb's are hidden)?  is it just a<br/>
&gt; matter of time before more officials "discover"<br/>
&gt; letterboxing, hunt down the boxes and destroy them<br/>
&gt; (and use the self-addressed stamped postcards to send<br/>
&gt; the "hefty fines" to the owners)?  do any public<br/>
&gt; entities officially (or unofficially) condone<br/>
&gt; letterboxing?  if so, how was this approval achieved?<br/>
