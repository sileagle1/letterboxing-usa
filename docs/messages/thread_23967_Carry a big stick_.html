                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know the season is getting late. I know the weather is turning <br/>
cold I know <br/>
with the holidays approaching people have other things on their <br/>
minds, but <br/>
there are a few of us die-hards out there. Those of us who would <br/>
search for the <br/>
last LB in the midst of a blizzard need to know this. I haven't been <br/>
at it as long as some of you but I am really hooked. There is a <br/>
wonderful spot <br/>
near Sparta, TN where a wonderful box has been planted. The clue is <br/>
more than <br/>
moderately intriguing. The stamp, for a store bought, is cute enough <br/>
and fits <br/>
right there in my logbook without disturbing or quarreling with the <br/>
other stamps. <br/>
All in all it was a great hunt, find &amp; a good day out with my <br/>
daughter...until. <br/>
We stopped at a store to ask concerning the road in the clue, as it <br/>
was miss-named in the clue. While at the country market we used the <br/>
bathroom, gassed up, <br/>
got refreshments and directions (as best as they could make out <br/>
without telling <br/>
them we were looking for a letter box) and then we were off again. <br/>
As it fell, <br/>
the assistance they gave us was profitable. They led us directly to <br/>
what looked <br/>
like it ought to be the place. There was one piece of the puzzle <br/>
that we could <br/>
not find. We got out of our vehicle and walked around a bit and lo <br/>
and behold <br/>
my daughter found the place where the box was supposed to be. Now, <br/>
here is a <br/>
tip for all of you boxers out there, whether avid boxers or just <br/>
week-end <br/>
enthusiasts. If you have to uncover a box, please, please, please <br/>
use a stick. <br/>
If a stick is not available, leave the box where it is. Our clue <br/>
said to move a <br/>
stone that stood tall. Then we were to dig under that stone. I <br/>
realize it is <br/>
against etiquette to bury one in the ground but the clue said "dig <br/>
deep". I have <br/>
of late put a small spade with my boxing gear for such occaisions. <br/>
At any rate, <br/>
we moved the tall stone, I reached down and started scooping with my <br/>
hand until <br/>
my daughter started screaming. I looked up at her and noticed she <br/>
was starring <br/>
down at where I was digging. The first thought that went through my <br/>
head was <br/>
"Lord, what have I uncovered?" That was when the pain became <br/>
evident. When I <br/>
looked down, both of my hands and the ground in front of me were <br/>
covered with <br/>
blood. From the pain, I knew it must be mine. There was broken glass <br/>
in the <br/>
hole. It was big pieces of glass. It appeared that someone had <br/>
broken 3 or 4 <br/>
beer bottles and filled the hole with glass before they covered the <br/>
box. God <br/>
bless my girl, she gave me her outer shirt ( she had a flannel over <br/>
a T-shirt) <br/>
and I wrapped up as best as I could. Now, as if you haven't been <br/>
rubbed enough, here's the real rub. We drove <br/>
to a nearby hospital and were told that the attending physician was <br/>
on the <br/>
golf corse and that they would have to page him. They started <br/>
processing my <br/>
paperwork and then notified me that he would not accept my <br/>
insurance. The <br/>
hospital would but the doctor would not. At this we left and drove <br/>
all the way <br/>
back to Middle Tennessee Medical Center in Rutherford County. I had <br/>
5 stitches <br/>
in the tips of the first two fingers of my right hand; 17 stitches <br/>
on the back <br/>
of my right hand (split between 3 different cuts);6 stitches in the <br/>
palm of my <br/>
right hand; I had cut into the ligament in my middle finger on my <br/>
left hand, <br/>
and for about 1/4 of an inch I would have lost the tip of my left <br/>
pinky. You <br/>
would think a body would feel something like that. I know I have <br/>
wondered time <br/>
and time again how I didn't. My point is this. I am a die-hard <br/>
boxer. I have <br/>
been warned about putting myself at risk a hundred times. It is when <br/>
you least <br/>
expect it that injury will reach out and nab you. I was merely <br/>
digging up a <br/>
box. I recall actually racing with Gracy to the box to see who would <br/>
get to <br/>
pull it out. My horror is, what if she had beaten me to it. We <br/>
contacted the <br/>
owner of the box and they said they would check on it. We never <br/>
heard anything <br/>
back from them.<br/>
As it turned out this box was really there. My daughter and I went <br/>
back a few <br/>
weeks later and found it. We took a small spade with us. It is now, <br/>
as I said <br/>
before, a permanent part of our gear. The glass was still in the <br/>
hole. I was <br/>
surprised at how much glass it was. You could still see the blood on <br/>
the <br/>
ground. We scooped the glass out (along with the dirt) logged our <br/>
find, and <br/>
then walked back into the woods a piece where we dug up some good <br/>
dirt in a <br/>
coffee can and refilled the hole. At last check, the box was just <br/>
under the <br/>
stone, and Gracy and I were the last two to log it. I am thinking it <br/>
to be <br/>
abandoned. I am also thinking it to be someone elses headache. Just <br/>
read <br/>
all clues carefully. If you find a clue in this particullar area <br/>
with anything at <br/>
all familliar sounding about it, please take a spade or a shovel. At <br/>
least use <br/>
a stick. I am back to work, back to boxing, back to basics and <br/>
taking fewer <br/>
risks. It sobers you up when your children witness your stupidity. <br/>
My first two <br/>
fingers on my left hand are still numb. The doctor says they will <br/>
likely always <br/>
be.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think one thing that letterboxers need to start seriously considering is<br/>
that as the popularity of the pasttime takes off, it's going to attrack some<br/>
very strange people to do some very strange things, especially if they feel<br/>
they possibly won't be caught or prosecuted.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's really necessary to realize that not all the clues posted<br/>
nowadays will necessarily be posted by "sane" people.<br/>
<br/>
Some boxes might turn out to be relatively harmless pranks.  I recently went<br/>
looking for one that was listed on LbNA that I'm almost positive, from what<br/>
I heard in the neighborhood afterwards, were just some clues posted with no<br/>
box to be found so that some teenage boys could videotape confused<br/>
letterboxers out their bedroom window.  Gee, maybe some of us will make the<br/>
next Borat movie?  :-)<br/>
<br/>
But other boxes might turn out to be dangerous.  Either luring people into<br/>
dangerous areas in anticipation of robbing, raping, or mugging someone, or<br/>
something like what Wendell ran into where there's some serious physical<br/>
damage done by how the box was set up.  Wendell's post seems to me to be a<br/>
great wake-up call post that we need to not only be careful out there but to<br/>
start being *extra* careful.<br/>

HI Mosey<br/>
<br/>
This is one of the reasons I wrote the security article a few years <br/>
back. The article can be found at AQ in the Code of Conduct section <br/>
as well as at Silent Dougs web site and somewhere in Mark and Sue's <br/>
site.<br/>
<br/>
At the time I wrote the info there was some chat on this list about <br/>
leaving personal info..addresses and phone numbers in letterboxes <br/>
and that point was being encouraged by a few naive folks.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that you have to be just as "on guard" while <br/>
pursuing a letterbox as you would be in some "bad neighborhood" in a <br/>
big city. Most letterboxes are located in areas the finder does not <br/>
know well.<br/>

Welcome to our group!  Glad to know that this situation has not soured you on the fun of letterboxing and you are still interested in conversing with other 'boxers.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Carry a big stick!<br/>
<br/>
I know the season is getting late. I know the weather is turning <br/>
cold I know <br/>
with the holidays approaching people have other things on their <br/>
minds, but <br/>
there are a few of us die-hards out there. Those of us who would <br/>
search for the <br/>
last LB in the midst of a blizzard need to know this. I haven't been <br/>
at it as long as some of you but I am really hooked. There is a <br/>
wonderful spot <br/>
near Sparta, TN where a wonderful box has been planted. The clue is <br/>
more than <br/>
moderately intriguing. The stamp, for a store bought, is cute enough <br/>
and fits <br/>
right there in my logbook without disturbing or quarreling with the <br/>
other stamps. <br/>
All in all it was a great hunt, find &amp; a good day out with my <br/>
daughter...until. <br/>
We stopped at a store to ask concerning the road in the clue, as it <br/>
was miss-named in the clue. While at the country market we used the <br/>
bathroom, gassed up, <br/>
got refreshments and directions (as best as they could make out <br/>
without telling <br/>
them we were looking for a letter box) and then we were off again. <br/>
As it fell, <br/>
the assistance they gave us was profitable. They led us directly to <br/>
what looked <br/>
like it ought to be the place. There was one piece of the puzzle <br/>
that we could <br/>
not find. We got out of our vehicle and walked around a bit and lo <br/>
and behold <br/>
my daughter found the place where the box was supposed to be. Now, <br/>
here is a <br/>
tip for all of you boxers out there, whether avid boxers or just <br/>
week-end <br/>
enthusiasts. If you have to uncover a box, please, please, please <br/>
use a stick. <br/>
If a stick is not available, leave the box where it is. Our clue <br/>
said to move a <br/>
stone that stood tall. Then we were to dig under that stone. I <br/>
realize it is <br/>
against etiquette to bury one in the ground but the clue said "dig <br/>
deep". I have <br/>
of late put a small spade with my boxing gear for such occaisions. <br/>
At any rate, <br/>
we moved the tall stone, I reached down and started scooping with my <br/>
hand until <br/>
my daughter started screaming. I looked up at her and noticed she <br/>
was starring <br/>
down at where I was digging. The first thought that went through my <br/>
head was <br/>
"Lord, what have I uncovered?" That was when the pain became <br/>
evident. When I <br/>
looked down, both of my hands and the ground in front of me were <br/>
covered with <br/>
blood. From the pain, I knew it must be mine. There was broken glass <br/>
in the <br/>
hole. It was big pieces of glass. It appeared that someone had <br/>
broken 3 or 4 <br/>
beer bottles and filled the hole with glass before they covered the <br/>
box. God <br/>
bless my girl, she gave me her outer shirt ( she had a flannel over <br/>
a T-shirt) <br/>
and I wrapped up as best as I could. Now, as if you haven't been <br/>
rubbed enough, here's the real rub. We drove <br/>
to a nearby hospital and were told that the attending physician was <br/>
on the <br/>
golf corse and that they would have to page him. They started <br/>
processing my <br/>
paperwork and then notified me that he would not accept my <br/>
insurance. The <br/>
hospital would but the doctor would not. At this we left and drove <br/>
all the way <br/>
back to Middle Tennessee Medical Center in Rutherford County. I had <br/>
5 stitches <br/>
in the tips of the first two fingers of my right hand; 17 stitches <br/>
on the back <br/>
of my right hand (split between 3 different cuts);6 stitches in the <br/>
palm of my <br/>
right hand; I had cut into the ligament in my middle finger on my <br/>
left hand, <br/>
and for about 1/4 of an inch I would have lost the tip of my left <br/>
pinky. You <br/>
would think a body would feel something like that. I know I have <br/>
wondered time <br/>
and time again how I didn't. My point is this. I am a die-hard <br/>
boxer. I have <br/>
been warned about putting myself at risk a hundred times. It is when <br/>
you least <br/>
expect it that injury will reach out and nab you. I was merely <br/>
digging up a <br/>
box. I recall actually racing with Gracy to the box to see who would <br/>
get to <br/>
pull it out. My horror is, what if she had beaten me to it. We <br/>
contacted the <br/>
owner of the box and they said they would check on it. We never <br/>
heard anything <br/>
back from them.<br/>
As it turned out this box was really there. My daughter and I went <br/>
back a few <br/>
weeks later and found it. We took a small spade with us. It is now, <br/>
as I said <br/>
before, a permanent part of our gear. The glass was still in the <br/>
hole. I was <br/>
surprised at how much glass it was. You could still see the blood on <br/>
the <br/>
ground. We scooped the glass out (along with the dirt) logged our <br/>
find, and <br/>
then walked back into the woods a piece where we dug up some good <br/>
dirt in a <br/>
coffee can and refilled the hole. At last check, the box was just <br/>
under the <br/>
stone, and Gracy and I were the last two to log it. I am thinking it <br/>
to be <br/>
abandoned. I am also thinking it to be someone elses headache. Just <br/>
read <br/>
all clues carefully. If you find a clue in this particullar area <br/>
with anything at <br/>
all familliar sounding about it, please take a spade or a shovel. At <br/>
least use <br/>
a stick. I am back to work, back to boxing, back to basics and <br/>
taking fewer <br/>
risks. It sobers you up when your children witness your stupidity. <br/>
My first two <br/>
fingers on my left hand are still numb. The doctor says they will <br/>
likely always <br/>
be.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Finding letterboxes is fun! There is no two ways around it. When my <br/>
daughter and I started it was because we needed a hobby. Her mother <br/>
can take a Dell or PennyPress puzzle book to the extreme. I mean <br/>
till there's nothing else around. I don't know about running up your <br/>
count, I just know it's fun. The high I get from finding a <br/>
particullarly good box is unmatchable. I am on one right now. Gracy <br/>
and I just got back from a hunt that is to be a favorite of mine. I <br/>
could never discourage letterboxing, or endorse it not being a good <br/>
idea, I just want each and every one of you to be very careful. It's <br/>
clear that the more we move into society, the more society moves <br/>
into us. <br/>
As for who placed the glass... I would not begin to presume the <br/>
planter did it. Although they have not contacted me again, the box <br/>
was there. If they had placed glass they would have placed the glass <br/>
alone or on a decoy box. There were other stamps in the logbook. I <br/>
think some hooligan did it. Yes, that's right, I said hooligan. Now, <br/>
I'm sorry you had to hear that come out of me but, garsh darnit they <br/>
get what they pay for. :)<br/>

&gt; and time again how I didn't. My point is this. I am a die-hard <br/>
&gt; boxer. I have <br/>
&gt; been warned about putting myself at risk a hundred times. It is <br/>
when <br/>
&gt; you least <br/>
&gt; expect it that injury will reach out and nab you. I was merely <br/>
&gt; digging up a <br/>
&gt; box. I recall actually racing with Gracy to the box to see who <br/>
would <br/>
&gt; get to <br/>
&gt; pull it out. My horror is, what if she had beaten me to it. We <br/>
&gt; contacted the <br/>
&gt; owner of the box and they said they would check on it. We never <br/>
&gt; heard anything <br/>
&gt; back from them.<br/>
&gt; As it turned out this box was really there. My daughter and I went <br/>
&gt; back a few <br/>
&gt; weeks later and found it. We took a small spade with us. It is <br/>
now, <br/>
&gt; as I said <br/>
&gt; before, a permanent part of our gear. The glass was still in the <br/>
&gt; hole. I was <br/>
&gt; surprised at how much glass it was. You could still see the blood <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; ground. We scooped the glass out (along with the dirt) logged our <br/>
&gt; find, and <br/>
&gt; then walked back into the woods a piece where we dug up some good <br/>
&gt; dirt in a <br/>
&gt; coffee can and refilled the hole. At last check, the box was just <br/>
&gt; under the <br/>
&gt; stone, and Gracy and I were the last two to log it. I am thinking <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; to be <br/>
&gt; abandoned. I am also thinking it to be someone elses headache. <br/>
Just <br/>
&gt; read <br/>
&gt; all clues carefully. If you find a clue in this particullar area <br/>
&gt; with anything at <br/>
&gt; all familliar sounding about it, please take a spade or a shovel. <br/>
At <br/>
&gt; least use <br/>
&gt; a stick. I am back to work, back to boxing, back to basics and <br/>
&gt; taking fewer <br/>
&gt; risks. It sobers you up when your children witness your stupidity. <br/>
&gt; My first two <br/>
&gt; fingers on my left hand are still numb. The doctor says they will <br/>
&gt; likely always <br/>
&gt; be.<br/>

There are thousands of boxers in the US who are not a member of any chat<br/>
list, web site, or other related thing. They are still boxers, some I would<br/>
call DIE HARD. There is nothing that says you have to be connected to the<br/>
internet to letterbox. If youre out looking for boxes in driving rain, in<br/>
the snow, in the dark, in the wee hours of the morning, when you should be<br/>
cleaning house, when you drag your friends with you and your family. When<br/>
you plan your travel around boxes.. youre a die hard. It has nothing to do<br/>
with when you signed up for the list!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know the season is getting late. I know the weather is turning <br/>
&gt; cold I know <br/>
&gt; with the holidays approaching people have other things on their <br/>
&gt; minds, but <br/>
&gt; there are a few of us die-hards out there. Those of us who would <br/>
&gt; search for the <br/>
&gt; last LB in the midst of a blizzard need to know this. I haven't <br/>
been <br/>
&gt; at it as long as some of you but I am really hooked. There is a <br/>
&gt; wonderful spot <br/>
&gt; near Sparta, TN where a wonderful box has been planted. The clue <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; more than <br/>
&gt; moderately intriguing. The stamp, for a store bought, is cute <br/>
enough <br/>
&gt; and fits <br/>
&gt; right there in my logbook without disturbing or quarreling with <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; other stamps. <br/>
&gt; All in all it was a great hunt, find &amp; a good day out with my <br/>
&gt; daughter...until. <br/>
&gt; We stopped at a store to ask concerning the road in the clue, as <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; was miss-named in the clue. While at the country market we used <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; bathroom, gassed up, <br/>
&gt; got refreshments and directions (as best as they could make out <br/>
&gt; without telling <br/>
&gt; them we were looking for a letter box) and then we were off again. <br/>
&gt; As it fell, <br/>
&gt; the assistance they gave us was profitable. They led us directly <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; what looked <br/>
&gt; like it ought to be the place. There was one piece of the puzzle <br/>
&gt; that we could <br/>
&gt; not find. We got out of our vehicle and walked around a bit and lo <br/>
&gt; and behold <br/>
&gt; my daughter found the place where the box was supposed to be. Now, <br/>
&gt; here is a <br/>
&gt; tip for all of you boxers out there, whether avid boxers or just <br/>
&gt; week-end <br/>
&gt; enthusiasts. If you have to uncover a box, please, please, please <br/>
&gt; use a stick. <br/>
&gt; If a stick is not available, leave the box where it is. Our clue <br/>
&gt; said to move a <br/>
&gt; stone that stood tall. Then we were to dig under that stone. I <br/>
&gt; realize it is <br/>
&gt; against etiquette to bury one in the ground but the clue said "dig <br/>
&gt; deep". I have <br/>
&gt; of late put a small spade with my boxing gear for such occaisions. <br/>
&gt; At any rate, <br/>
&gt; we moved the tall stone, I reached down and started scooping with <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; hand until <br/>
&gt; my daughter started screaming. I looked up at her and noticed she <br/>
&gt; was starring <br/>
&gt; down at where I was digging. The first thought that went through <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; head was <br/>
&gt; "Lord, what have I uncovered?" That was when the pain became <br/>
&gt; evident. When I <br/>
&gt; looked down, both of my hands and the ground in front of me were <br/>
&gt; covered with <br/>
&gt; blood. From the pain, I knew it must be mine. There was broken <br/>
glass <br/>
&gt; in the <br/>
&gt; hole. It was big pieces of glass. It appeared that someone had <br/>
&gt; broken 3 or 4 <br/>
&gt; beer bottles and filled the hole with glass before they covered <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; box. God <br/>
&gt; bless my girl, she gave me her outer shirt ( she had a flannel <br/>
over <br/>
&gt; a T-shirt) <br/>
&gt; and I wrapped up as best as I could. Now, as if you haven't been <br/>
&gt; rubbed enough, here's the real rub. We drove <br/>
&gt; to a nearby hospital and were told that the attending physician <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; on the <br/>
&gt; golf corse and that they would have to page him. They started <br/>
&gt; processing my <br/>
&gt; paperwork and then notified me that he would not accept my <br/>
&gt; insurance. The <br/>
&gt; hospital would but the doctor would not. At this we left and drove <br/>
&gt; all the way <br/>
&gt; back to Middle Tennessee Medical Center in Rutherford County. I <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; 5 stitches <br/>
&gt; in the tips of the first two fingers of my right hand; 17 stitches <br/>
&gt; on the back <br/>
&gt; of my right hand (split between 3 different cuts);6 stitches in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; palm of my <br/>
&gt; right hand; I had cut into the ligament in my middle finger on my <br/>
&gt; left hand, <br/>
&gt; and for about 1/4 of an inch I would have lost the tip of my left <br/>
&gt; pinky. You <br/>
&gt; would think a body would feel something like that. I know I have <br/>
&gt; wondered time <br/>
&gt; and time again how I didn't. My point is this. I am a die-hard <br/>
&gt; boxer. I have <br/>
&gt; been warned about putting myself at risk a hundred times. It is <br/>

&gt; before, a permanent part of our gear. The glass was still in the <br/>
&gt; hole. I was <br/>
&gt; surprised at how much glass it was. You could still see the blood <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; ground. We scooped the glass out (along with the dirt) logged our <br/>
&gt; find, and <br/>
&gt; then walked back into the woods a piece where we dug up some good <br/>
&gt; dirt in a <br/>
&gt; coffee can and refilled the hole. At last check, the box was just <br/>
&gt; under the <br/>
&gt; stone, and Gracy and I were the last two to log it. I am thinking <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; to be <br/>
&gt; abandoned. I am also thinking it to be someone elses headache. <br/>
Just <br/>
&gt; read <br/>
&gt; all clues carefully. If you find a clue in this particullar area <br/>
&gt; with anything at <br/>
&gt; all familliar sounding about it, please take a spade or a shovel. <br/>
At <br/>
&gt; least use <br/>
&gt; a stick. I am back to work, back to boxing, back to basics and <br/>
&gt; taking fewer <br/>
&gt; risks. It sobers you up when your children witness your stupidity. <br/>
&gt; My first two <br/>
&gt; fingers on my left hand are still numb. The doctor says they will <br/>
&gt; likely always <br/>
&gt; be.<br/>

There are thousands of boxers in the US who are not a member of any chat<br/>

call DIE HARD. There is nothing that says you have to be connected to the<br/>
internet to letterbox. If you're out looking for boxes in driving rain, in<br/>
the snow, in the dark, in the wee hours of the morning, when you should be<br/>
cleaning house, when you drag your friends with you and your family. When<br/>
you plan your travel around boxes.. you're a die hard. It has nothing to do<br/>
with when you signed up for the list!<br/>

&gt; I know the season is getting late. I know the weather is turning <br/>
&gt; cold I know <br/>
&gt; with the holidays approaching people have other things on their <br/>
&gt; minds, but <br/>
&gt; there are a few of us die-hards out there. Those of us who would <br/>
&gt; search for the <br/>
&gt; last LB in the midst of a blizzard need to know this. I haven't <br/>
been <br/>
&gt; at it as long as some of you but I am really hooked. There is a <br/>
&gt; wonderful spot <br/>
&gt; near Sparta, TN where a wonderful box has been planted. The clue <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; more than <br/>
&gt; moderately intriguing. The stamp, for a store bought, is cute <br/>
enough <br/>
&gt; and fits <br/>
&gt; right there in my logbook without disturbing or quarreling with <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; other stamps. <br/>
&gt; All in all it was a great hunt, find &amp; a good day out with my <br/>
&gt; daughter...until. <br/>
&gt; We stopped at a store to ask concerning the road in the clue, as <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; was miss-named in the clue. While at the country market we used <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; bathroom, gassed up, <br/>
&gt; got refreshments and directions (as best as they could make out <br/>
&gt; without telling <br/>
&gt; them we were looking for a letter box) and then we were off again. <br/>
&gt; As it fell, <br/>
&gt; the assistance they gave us was profitable. They led us directly <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; what looked <br/>
&gt; like it ought to be the place. There was one piece of the puzzle <br/>
&gt; that we could <br/>
&gt; not find. We got out of our vehicle and walked around a bit and lo <br/>
&gt; and behold <br/>
&gt; my daughter found the place where the box was supposed to be. Now, <br/>
&gt; here is a <br/>
&gt; tip for all of you boxers out there, whether avid boxers or just <br/>
&gt; week-end <br/>
&gt; enthusiasts. If you have to uncover a box, please, please, please <br/>
&gt; use a stick. <br/>
&gt; If a stick is not available, leave the box where it is. Our clue <br/>
&gt; said to move a <br/>
&gt; stone that stood tall. Then we were to dig under that stone. I <br/>
&gt; realize it is <br/>
&gt; against etiquette to bury one in the ground but the clue said "dig <br/>
&gt; deep". I have <br/>
&gt; of late put a small spade with my boxing gear for such occaisions. <br/>
&gt; At any rate, <br/>
&gt; we moved the tall stone, I reached down and started scooping with <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; hand until <br/>
&gt; my daughter started screaming. I looked up at her and noticed she <br/>
&gt; was starring <br/>
&gt; down at where I was digging. The first thought that went through <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; head was <br/>
&gt; "Lord, what have I uncovered?" That was when the pain became <br/>
&gt; evident. When I <br/>
&gt; looked down, both of my hands and the ground in front of me were <br/>
&gt; covered with <br/>
&gt; blood. From the pain, I knew it must be mine. There was broken <br/>
glass <br/>
&gt; in the <br/>
&gt; hole. It was big pieces of glass. It appeared that someone had <br/>
&gt; broken 3 or 4 <br/>
&gt; beer bottles and filled the hole with glass before they covered <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; box. God <br/>
&gt; bless my girl, she gave me her outer shirt ( she had a flannel <br/>
over <br/>
&gt; a T-shirt) <br/>
&gt; and I wrapped up as best as I could. Now, as if you haven't been <br/>
&gt; rubbed enough, here's the real rub. We drove <br/>
&gt; to a nearby hospital and were told that the attending physician <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; on the <br/>
&gt; golf corse and that they would have to page him. They started <br/>
&gt; processing my <br/>
&gt; paperwork and then notified me that he would not accept my <br/>
&gt; insurance. The <br/>
&gt; hospital would but the doctor would not. At this we left and drove <br/>
&gt; all the way <br/>
&gt; back to Middle Tennessee Medical Center in Rutherford County. I <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; 5 stitches <br/>
&gt; in the tips of the first two fingers of my right hand; 17 stitches <br/>
&gt; on the back <br/>
&gt; of my right hand (split between 3 different cuts);6 stitches in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; palm of my <br/>
&gt; right hand; I had cut into the ligament in my middle finger on my <br/>
&gt; left hand, <br/>
&gt; and for about 1/4 of an inch I would have lost the tip of my left <br/>
&gt; pinky. You <br/>
&gt; would think a body would feel something like that. I know I have <br/>
&gt; wondered time <br/>
&gt; and time again how I didn't. My point is this. I am a die-hard <br/>
&gt; boxer. I have <br/>
&gt; been warned about putting myself at risk a hundred times. It is <br/>
when <br/>
&gt; you least <br/>
&gt; expect it that injury will reach out and nab you. I was merely <br/>
&gt; digging up a <br/>
&gt; box. I recall actually racing with Gracy to the box to see who <br/>
would <br/>
&gt; get to <br/>
&gt; pull it out. My horror is, what if she had beaten me to it. We <br/>
&gt; contacted the <br/>
&gt; owner of the box and they said they would check on it. We never <br/>
&gt; heard anything <br/>
&gt; back from them.<br/>
&gt; As it turned out this box was really there. My daughter and I went <br/>
&gt; back a few <br/>
&gt; weeks later and found it. We took a small spade with us. It is <br/>
now, <br/>
&gt; as I said <br/>
&gt; before, a permanent part of our gear. The glass was still in the <br/>

Scanning the posts I saw my name and thought"Oh, crap what did I do now". Then I saw it <br/>
was HnH. Whew, what a relief. Looking forward to the Tyler gather. These days I need a <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was looking for a box in the mountains last week, on an established <br/>
trail, and I made sure I took a long pokey stick with me.  I left my <br/>
hubby (and the dogs) fishing, and the (nearly) 3 year old went with <br/>
me.  We have black widows &amp; lizards here at home, it's habit for me to <br/>
not stick my hand into anything without gloves or a stick!  We didn't <br/>
find the box, but flushed a lot of quail.  It was startling enough that <br/>
I was wishing I'd had a dog with me, but they don't like to be <br/>
seperated, and there was no way I could handle both of them and the <br/>
little one on the trail.  <br/>
<br/>
As a bonus, I discovered that when you need both hands to check a clue, <br/>
the stick comes in mighty handy.  I stuck one end in the ground, the <br/>
other in my arm, and had my little one hold onto it, since I had to let <br/>
go of her hand!  <br/>

Sticks are very useful!<br/>

From: http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html#007<br/>
Hiding it under rocks and natural rock    ledges seems to work the best,<br/>
followed by downed, hollow logs. .... I recommend against    burying the<br/>
thing, because you don't want people digging in parks, many of    which<br/>
have artifacts buried and restrictions against digging -- such activity<br/>
will give the hobby a bad name.<br/>
From: http://www.letterboxing.org/GettingStarted/getstart_finding.htm<br/>
Letterboxing is intended to be an environmentally friendly activity,<br/>
with as little impact as possible on the environment involved in hunting<br/>
for letterboxes. .... Do not disturb any historical landmark or private<br/>
property. Do not dig, remove native vegetation, disturb natural rock<br/>
formations, or interfere with animals or their habitats.<br/>
From: http://www.atlasquest.com/aboutlb/rules/leavenotrace.html<br/>
Care must be taken in both planting and finding letterboxes. While<br/>
planting a letterbox, avoid environmentally sensitive areas. .... Use<br/>
natural hiding places for your letterbox instead of digging holes or<br/>
moving large rocks.<br/>
From: http://www.letterboxing.info/articles/00000004.php<br/>
When placing letterboxes, ...You should also take care when hiding a<br/>
letterbox not to damage the immediate area. Do not tear bark off a tree<br/>
to cover up a box, or dig a hole to bury a box, for instance.<br/>
Wendell gives us another reason why burying and digging for boxes is not<br/>
a good idea. So sorry to hear about your appalling misfortune.<br/>

I read the clues and it appears to be a headstone that's over 100 years old.<br/>
But maybe it's in the family of the placer and they have permission to have<br/>
put a letterbox there.  I wouldn't have done any digging whatsoever either<br/>
unless I already knew the placer absolutely had permission from the family,<br/>
once I saw that it was a headstone.  I take that back.  I just would've<br/>
walked away period.  Being as how it's apparently a 100 year old headstone,<br/>
I don't think I would have gone after it even if the placer had *had*<br/>
permission.  I wouldn't have felt right about it.<br/>
<br/>
Wendell, is the hand doing OK?  What a bummer of a day.<br/>

some I would<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I know the season is getting late. I know the weather is turning <br/>
&gt; &gt; cold I know <br/>
&gt; &gt; with the holidays approaching people have other things on their <br/>
&gt; &gt; minds, but <br/>
&gt; &gt; there are a few of us die-hards out there. Those of us who would <br/>
&gt; &gt; search for the <br/>
&gt; &gt; last LB in the midst of a blizzard need to know this. I haven't <br/>
&gt; been <br/>
&gt; &gt; at it as long as some of you but I am really hooked. There is a <br/>
&gt; &gt; wonderful spot <br/>
&gt; &gt; near Sparta, TN where a wonderful box has been planted. The clue <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; more than <br/>
&gt; &gt; moderately intriguing. The stamp, for a store bought, is cute <br/>
&gt; enough <br/>
&gt; &gt; and fits <br/>
&gt; &gt; right there in my logbook without disturbing or quarreling with <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; other stamps. <br/>
&gt; &gt; All in all it was a great hunt, find &amp; a good day out with my <br/>
&gt; &gt; daughter...until. <br/>
&gt; &gt; We stopped at a store to ask concerning the road in the clue, as <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; was miss-named in the clue. While at the country market we used <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; bathroom, gassed up, <br/>
&gt; &gt; got refreshments and directions (as best as they could make out <br/>
&gt; &gt; without telling <br/>
&gt; &gt; them we were looking for a letter box) and then we were off <br/>
again. <br/>
&gt; &gt; As it fell, <br/>
&gt; &gt; the assistance they gave us was profitable. They led us directly <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; what looked <br/>
&gt; &gt; like it ought to be the place. There was one piece of the puzzle <br/>
&gt; &gt; that we could <br/>
&gt; &gt; not find. We got out of our vehicle and walked around a bit and <br/>
lo <br/>
&gt; &gt; and behold <br/>
&gt; &gt; my daughter found the place where the box was supposed to be. <br/>
Now, <br/>
&gt; &gt; here is a <br/>
&gt; &gt; tip for all of you boxers out there, whether avid boxers or just <br/>
&gt; &gt; week-end <br/>
&gt; &gt; enthusiasts. If you have to uncover a box, please, please, <br/>
please <br/>
&gt; &gt; use a stick. <br/>
&gt; &gt; If a stick is not available, leave the box where it is. Our clue <br/>
&gt; &gt; said to move a <br/>
&gt; &gt; stone that stood tall. Then we were to dig under that stone. I <br/>
&gt; &gt; realize it is <br/>
&gt; &gt; against etiquette to bury one in the ground but the clue <br/>
said "dig <br/>
&gt; &gt; deep". I have <br/>
&gt; &gt; of late put a small spade with my boxing gear for such <br/>
occaisions. <br/>
&gt; &gt; At any rate, <br/>
&gt; &gt; we moved the tall stone, I reached down and started scooping <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; my <br/>
&gt; &gt; hand until <br/>
&gt; &gt; my daughter started screaming. I looked up at her and noticed <br/>
she <br/>
&gt; &gt; was starring <br/>
&gt; &gt; down at where I was digging. The first thought that went through <br/>
&gt; my <br/>
&gt; &gt; head was <br/>
&gt; &gt; "Lord, what have I uncovered?" That was when the pain became <br/>
&gt; &gt; evident. When I <br/>
&gt; &gt; looked down, both of my hands and the ground in front of me were <br/>
&gt; &gt; covered with <br/>
&gt; &gt; blood. From the pain, I knew it must be mine. There was broken <br/>
&gt; glass <br/>
&gt; &gt; in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; hole. It was big pieces of glass. It appeared that someone had <br/>
&gt; &gt; broken 3 or 4 <br/>
&gt; &gt; beer bottles and filled the hole with glass before they covered <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; box. God <br/>
&gt; &gt; bless my girl, she gave me her outer shirt ( she had a flannel <br/>
&gt; over <br/>
&gt; &gt; a T-shirt) <br/>
&gt; &gt; and I wrapped up as best as I could. Now, as if you haven't been <br/>
&gt; &gt; rubbed enough, here's the real rub. We drove <br/>
&gt; &gt; to a nearby hospital and were told that the attending physician <br/>
&gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt; on the <br/>
&gt; &gt; golf corse and that they would have to page him. They started <br/>
&gt; &gt; processing my <br/>
&gt; &gt; paperwork and then notified me that he would not accept my <br/>
&gt; &gt; insurance. The <br/>
&gt; &gt; hospital would but the doctor would not. At this we left and <br/>
drove <br/>
&gt; &gt; all the way <br/>
&gt; &gt; back to Middle Tennessee Medical Center in Rutherford County. I <br/>
&gt; had <br/>
&gt; &gt; 5 stitches <br/>
&gt; &gt; in the tips of the first two fingers of my right hand; 17 <br/>
stitches <br/>
&gt; &gt; on the back <br/>
&gt; &gt; of my right hand (split between 3 different cuts);6 stitches in <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; palm of my <br/>
&gt; &gt; right hand; I had cut into the ligament in my middle finger on <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; &gt; left hand, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and for about 1/4 of an inch I would have lost the tip of my <br/>
left <br/>
&gt; &gt; pinky. You <br/>
&gt; &gt; would think a body would feel something like that. I know I have <br/>
&gt; &gt; wondered time <br/>
&gt; &gt; and time again how I didn't. My point is this. I am a die-hard <br/>
&gt; &gt; boxer. I have <br/>
&gt; &gt; been warned about putting myself at risk a hundred times. It is <br/>
&gt; when <br/>
&gt; &gt; you least <br/>
&gt; &gt; expect it that injury will reach out and nab you. I was merely <br/>
&gt; &gt; digging up a <br/>
&gt; &gt; box. I recall actually racing with Gracy to the box to see who <br/>
&gt; would <br/>
&gt; &gt; get to <br/>
&gt; &gt; pull it out. My horror is, what if she had beaten me to it. We <br/>
&gt; &gt; contacted the <br/>
&gt; &gt; owner of the box and they said they would check on it. We never <br/>
&gt; &gt; heard anything <br/>
&gt; &gt; back from them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; As it turned out this box was really there. My daughter and I <br/>
went <br/>
&gt; &gt; back a few <br/>
&gt; &gt; weeks later and found it. We took a small spade with us. It is <br/>
&gt; now, <br/>
&gt; &gt; as I said <br/>
&gt; &gt; before, a permanent part of our gear. The glass was still in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; hole. I was <br/>
&gt; &gt; surprised at how much glass it was. You could still see the <br/>
blood <br/>
&gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; ground. We scooped the glass out (along with the dirt) logged <br/>
our <br/>
&gt; &gt; find, and <br/>
&gt; &gt; then walked back into the woods a piece where we dug up some <br/>
good <br/>
&gt; &gt; dirt in a <br/>
&gt; &gt; coffee can and refilled the hole. At last check, the box was <br/>
just <br/>
&gt; &gt; under the <br/>
&gt; &gt; stone, and Gracy and I were the last two to log it. I am <br/>
thinking <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; to be <br/>
&gt; &gt; abandoned. I am also thinking it to be someone elses headache. <br/>
&gt; Just <br/>
&gt; &gt; read <br/>
&gt; &gt; all clues carefully. If you find a clue in this particullar area <br/>
&gt; &gt; with anything at <br/>
&gt; &gt; all familliar sounding about it, please take a spade or a <br/>
shovel. <br/>
&gt; At <br/>
&gt; &gt; least use <br/>
&gt; &gt; a stick. I am back to work, back to boxing, back to basics and <br/>
&gt; &gt; taking fewer <br/>
&gt; &gt; risks. It sobers you up when your children witness your <br/>
stupidity. <br/>
&gt; &gt; My first two <br/>
&gt; &gt; fingers on my left hand are still numb. The doctor says they <br/>
will <br/>
&gt; &gt; likely always <br/>
&gt; &gt; be.<br/>

&gt; There are thousands of boxers in the US who are not a member of <br/>
any chat<br/>
&gt; list, web site, or other related thing. They are still boxers, <br/>
some I would<br/>
&gt; call DIE HARD. There is nothing that says you have to be connected <br/>
to the<br/>
&gt; internet to letterbox. If you're out looking for boxes in driving <br/>
rain, in<br/>
&gt; the snow, in the dark, in the wee hours of the morning, when you <br/>
should be<br/>
&gt; cleaning house, when you drag your friends with you and your <br/>
family. When<br/>
&gt; you plan your travel around boxes.. you're a die hard. It has <br/>
nothing to do<br/>
&gt; with when you signed up for the list!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: [LbNA] Carry a big stick!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I know the season is getting late. I know the weather is turning <br/>
&gt; &gt; cold I know <br/>
&gt; &gt; with the holidays approaching people have other things on their <br/>
&gt; &gt; minds, but <br/>
&gt; &gt; there are a few of us die-hards out there. Those of us who would <br/>
&gt; &gt; search for the <br/>
&gt; &gt; last LB in the midst of a blizzard need to know this. I haven't <br/>
&gt; been <br/>
&gt; &gt; at it as long as some of you but I am really hooked. There is a <br/>
&gt; &gt; wonderful spot <br/>
&gt; &gt; near Sparta, TN where a wonderful box has been planted. The clue <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; more than <br/>
&gt; &gt; moderately intriguing. The stamp, for a store bought, is cute <br/>
&gt; enough <br/>
&gt; &gt; and fits <br/>
&gt; &gt; right there in my logbook without disturbing or quarreling with <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; other stamps. <br/>
&gt; &gt; All in all it was a great hunt, find &amp; a good day out with my <br/>
&gt; &gt; daughter...until. <br/>
&gt; &gt; We stopped at a store to ask concerning the road in the clue, as <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; was miss-named in the clue. While at the country market we used <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; bathroom, gassed up, <br/>
&gt; &gt; got refreshments and directions (as best as they could make out <br/>
&gt; &gt; without telling <br/>
&gt; &gt; them we were looking for a letter box) and then we were off <br/>
again. <br/>
&gt; &gt; As it fell, <br/>
&gt; &gt; the assistance they gave us was profitable. They led us directly <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; what looked <br/>
&gt; &gt; like it ought to be the place. There was one piece of the puzzle <br/>
&gt; &gt; that we could <br/>
&gt; &gt; not find. We got out of our vehicle and walked around a bit and <br/>
lo <br/>
&gt; &gt; and behold <br/>
&gt; &gt; my daughter found the place where the box was supposed to be. <br/>
Now, <br/>
&gt; &gt; here is a <br/>
&gt; &gt; tip for all of you boxers out there, whether avid boxers or just <br/>
&gt; &gt; week-end <br/>
&gt; &gt; enthusiasts. If you have to uncover a box, please, please, <br/>
please <br/>
&gt; &gt; use a stick. <br/>
&gt; &gt; If a stick is not available, leave the box where it is. Our clue <br/>
&gt; &gt; said to move a <br/>
&gt; &gt; stone that stood tall. Then we were to dig under that stone. I <br/>
&gt; &gt; realize it is <br/>
&gt; &gt; against etiquette to bury one in the ground but the clue <br/>
said "dig <br/>
&gt; &gt; deep". I have <br/>
&gt; &gt; of late put a small spade with my boxing gear for such <br/>
occaisions. <br/>
&gt; &gt; At any rate, <br/>
&gt; &gt; we moved the tall stone, I reached down and started scooping <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; my <br/>
&gt; &gt; hand until <br/>
&gt; &gt; my daughter started screaming. I looked up at her and noticed <br/>
she <br/>
&gt; &gt; was starring <br/>
&gt; &gt; down at where I was digging. The first thought that went through <br/>
&gt; my <br/>
&gt; &gt; head was <br/>
&gt; &gt; "Lord, what have I uncovered?" That was when the pain became <br/>
&gt; &gt; evident. When I <br/>
&gt; &gt; looked down, both of my hands and the ground in front of me were <br/>
&gt; &gt; covered with <br/>
&gt; &gt; blood. From the pain, I knew it must be mine. There was broken <br/>
&gt; glass <br/>
&gt; &gt; in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; hole. It was big pieces of glass. It appeared that someone had <br/>
&gt; &gt; broken 3 or 4 <br/>
&gt; &gt; beer bottles and filled the hole with glass before they covered <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; box. God <br/>
&gt; &gt; bless my girl, she gave me her outer shirt ( she had a flannel <br/>
&gt; over <br/>
&gt; &gt; a T-shirt) <br/>
&gt; &gt; and I wrapped up as best as I could. Now, as if you haven't been <br/>
&gt; &gt; rubbed enough, here's the real rub. We drove <br/>
&gt; &gt; to a nearby hospital and were told that the attending physician <br/>
&gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt; on the <br/>
&gt; &gt; golf corse and that they would have to page him. They started <br/>
&gt; &gt; processing my <br/>
&gt; &gt; paperwork and then notified me that he would not accept my <br/>
&gt; &gt; insurance. The <br/>
&gt; &gt; hospital would but the doctor would not. At this we left and <br/>
drove <br/>
&gt; &gt; all the way <br/>
&gt; &gt; back to Middle Tennessee Medical Center in Rutherford County. I <br/>
&gt; had <br/>
&gt; &gt; 5 stitches <br/>
&gt; &gt; in the tips of the first two fingers of my right hand; 17 <br/>
stitches <br/>
&gt; &gt; on the back <br/>
&gt; &gt; of my right hand (split between 3 different cuts);6 stitches in <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; palm of my <br/>
&gt; &gt; right hand; I had cut into the ligament in my middle finger on <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; &gt; left hand, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and for about 1/4 of an inch I would have lost the tip of my <br/>
left <br/>
&gt; &gt; pinky. You <br/>
&gt; &gt; would think a body would feel something like that. I know I have <br/>
&gt; &gt; wondered time <br/>
&gt; &gt; and time again how I didn't. My point is this. I am a die-hard <br/>
&gt; &gt; boxer. I have <br/>
&gt; &gt; been warned about putting myself at risk a hundred times. It is <br/>
&gt; when <br/>
&gt; &gt; you least <br/>
&gt; &gt; expect it that injury will reach out and nab you. I was merely <br/>
&gt; &gt; digging up a <br/>
&gt; &gt; box. I recall actually racing with Gracy to the box to see who <br/>
&gt; would <br/>
&gt; &gt; get to <br/>
&gt; &gt; pull it out. My horror is, what if she had beaten me to it. We <br/>
&gt; &gt; contacted the <br/>
&gt; &gt; owner of the box and they said they would check on it. We never <br/>
&gt; &gt; heard anything <br/>
&gt; &gt; back from them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; As it turned out this box was really there. My daughter and I <br/>
went <br/>
&gt; &gt; back a few <br/>
&gt; &gt; weeks later and found it. We took a small spade with us. It is <br/>
&gt; now, <br/>
&gt; &gt; as I said <br/>
&gt; &gt; before, a permanent part of our gear. The glass was still in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; hole. I was <br/>
&gt; &gt; surprised at how much glass it was. You could still see the <br/>
blood <br/>
&gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; ground. We scooped the glass out (along with the dirt) logged <br/>
our <br/>
&gt; &gt; find, and <br/>
&gt; &gt; then walked back into the woods a piece where we dug up some <br/>
good <br/>
&gt; &gt; dirt in a <br/>
&gt; &gt; coffee can and refilled the hole. At last check, the box was <br/>
just <br/>
&gt; &gt; under the <br/>
&gt; &gt; stone, and Gracy and I were the last two to log it. I am <br/>
thinking <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; to be <br/>
&gt; &gt; abandoned. I am also thinking it to be someone elses headache. <br/>
&gt; Just <br/>
&gt; &gt; read <br/>
&gt; &gt; all clues carefully. If you find a clue in this particullar area <br/>
&gt; &gt; with anything at <br/>
&gt; &gt; all familliar sounding about it, please take a spade or a <br/>
shovel. <br/>
&gt; At <br/>
&gt; &gt; least use <br/>
&gt; &gt; a stick. I am back to work, back to boxing, back to basics and <br/>
&gt; &gt; taking fewer <br/>
&gt; &gt; risks. It sobers you up when your children witness your <br/>
stupidity. <br/>
&gt; &gt; My first two <br/>
&gt; &gt; fingers on my left hand are still numb. The doctor says they <br/>
will <br/>
&gt; &gt; likely always <br/>
&gt; &gt; be.<br/>

Then I<br/>

live with it...as the doctor said I would have to.<br/>
Secondly, it is not a headstone. It is behind a grave that is over <br/>
100 years old but the original headstone is still there. The rock in <br/>
the clue is a secondary rock that is behind the grave. It is about 2 <br/>
feet away, and it is just a piece of limestone. It is an odd shape, <br/>
but it is not "the" or "a" headstone. I would not have tampered with <br/>
a grave, or a grave yard, but as you saw in the clue, it was the <br/>
only one there. It was the only thing there, but for a few trees. <br/>
Whoever kept this lone grave sure tended it very well, as they had <br/>
it mulched and lined with monkey grass. The stone however was a <br/>
couple feet away from the grave.<br/>

&gt; That was why I was kind of wondering in the back of my mind if the <br/>
glass<br/>
&gt; might not have been put there by the placer.  I would certainly <br/>
hope not.<br/>
&gt; But the fact that the clues said to dig deep under a tall <br/>
stone........seems<br/>
&gt; odd.  It also seems odd to me that with such a serious situation, <br/>
the placer<br/>
&gt; said they'd check on it, then not only didn't get back to Wendell <br/>
but also<br/>
&gt; didn't see fit to go and immediately remove the glass, since the <br/>
glass was<br/>
&gt; still there when Wendell returned a few days later.  Nor did they <br/>
post any<br/>
&gt; note in the clues (as of this morning at least) as to what had <br/>
happened as a<br/>
&gt; warning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In a way, given our litigious society, I can see a placer deciding <br/>
not to<br/>
&gt; contact Wendell again.  I would consider that "rude" but an <br/>
attorney might<br/>
&gt; advise that.  On the other hand, I would have immediately gone and <br/>
removed<br/>
&gt; the glass or had someone in the area do it and also retired the <br/>
box from any<br/>
&gt; websites it was on.  Maybe that's overkill but as a placer, I'd be <br/>
very<br/>
&gt; upset.  Or maybe put a big fat note on the clue page.  If I was <br/>
the placer,<br/>
&gt; if I wasn't the one who put the glass there, I would be rather <br/>
upset and<br/>
&gt; would want to be absolutely sure that box was out of commission <br/>
anyway so<br/>
&gt; that whoever did do that wouldn't be returning to do it again.  <br/>
But that's<br/>
&gt; just what I would do.  Like I said, maybe others would consider <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; overkill.  At the very least, I'd post a warning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I read the clues and it appears to be a headstone that's over 100 <br/>
years old.<br/>
&gt; But maybe it's in the family of the placer and they have <br/>
permission to have<br/>
&gt; put a letterbox there.  I wouldn't have done any digging <br/>
whatsoever either<br/>
&gt; unless I already knew the placer absolutely had permission from <br/>
the family,<br/>
&gt; once I saw that it was a headstone.  I take that back.  I just <br/>
would've<br/>
&gt; walked away period.  Being as how it's apparently a 100 year old <br/>
headstone,<br/>
&gt; I don't think I would have gone after it even if the placer had <br/>
*had*<br/>
&gt; permission.  I wouldn't have felt right about it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wendell, is the hand doing OK?  What a bummer of a day.<br/>

That was why I was kind of wondering in the back of my mind if the <br/>
glass<br/>
&gt;  might not have been put there by the placer.  I would certainly <br/>
hope not.<br/>
&gt;  But the fact that the clues said to dig deep under a tall <br/>
stone........seems<br/>
&gt;  odd.  It also seems odd to me that with such a serious situation, <br/>
the placer<br/>
&gt;  said they'd check on it, then not only didn't get back to Wendell <br/>
but also<br/>
&gt;  didn't see fit to go and immediately remove the glass, since the <br/>
glass was<br/>
&gt;  still there when Wendell returned a few days later.  Nor did they <br/>
post any<br/>
&gt;  note in the clues (as of this morning at least) as to what had <br/>
happened as a<br/>
&gt;  warning.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  In a way, given our litigious society, I can see a placer <br/>
deciding not to<br/>
&gt;  contact Wendell again.  I would consider that "rude" but an <br/>
attorney might<br/>
&gt;  advise that.  On the other hand, I would have immediately gone <br/>
and removed<br/>
&gt;  the glass or had someone in the area do it and also retired the <br/>
box from any<br/>
&gt;  websites it was on.  Maybe that's overkill but as a placer, I'd <br/>
be very<br/>
&gt;  upset.  Or maybe put a big fat note on the clue page.  If I was <br/>
the placer,<br/>
&gt;  if I wasn't the one who put the glass there, I would be rather <br/>
upset and<br/>
&gt;  would want to be absolutely sure that box was out of commission <br/>
anyway so<br/>
&gt;  that whoever did do that wouldn't be returning to do it again.  <br/>
But that's<br/>
&gt;  just what I would do.  Like I said, maybe others would consider <br/>
that<br/>
&gt;  overkill.  At the very least, I'd post a warning.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  I read the clues and it appears to be a headstone that's over 100 <br/>
years old.<br/>
&gt;  But maybe it's in the family of the placer and they have <br/>
permission to have<br/>
&gt;  put a letterbox there.  I wouldn't have done any digging <br/>
whatsoever either<br/>
&gt;  unless I already knew the placer absolutely had permission from <br/>
the family,<br/>
&gt;  once I saw that it was a headstone.  I take that back.  I just <br/>
would've<br/>
&gt;  walked away period.  Being as how it's apparently a 100 year old <br/>
headstone,<br/>
&gt;  I don't think I would have gone after it even if the placer had <br/>
*had*<br/>

&gt; Secondly, it is not a headstone. It is behind a grave that is over <br/>
&gt; 100 years old but the original headstone is still there. The rock <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; the clue is a secondary rock that is behind the grave. It is about <br/>
2 <br/>
&gt; feet away, and it is just a piece of limestone. It is an odd <br/>
shape, <br/>
&gt; but it is not "the" or "a" headstone. I would not have tampered <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; a grave, or a grave yard, but as you saw in the clue, it was the <br/>
&gt; only one there. It was the only thing there, but for a few trees. <br/>
&gt; Whoever kept this lone grave sure tended it very well, as they had <br/>
&gt; it mulched and lined with monkey grass. The stone however was a <br/>

&gt; &gt; I just posted a message about burying boxes before seeing your<br/>
&gt; &gt; message. I'm really glad to see someone else is disturbed by the<br/>
&gt; &gt; digging requirement for this box.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone. We had a great time in Missouri. We picked up 4 boxes while we were there. 2 in MO., and 2 in IL. We got back last night and Gracy and I went to Sparta, TN. While the letterbox is still there, and there is some remnance of broken glass on the ground around the site, there is no glass in the hole. I am pleased to report that it looked relatively like I left it. (With the exception of other boxers leaving traces of their visit)<br/>

attempting to retrieve a box from a joint in a tree, I was using a <br/>
stick and grateful I had, as someone had left a broken glass down in <br/>
the joint, filled with durt, so only the jagged edges were sticking <br/>
out...plus the glass pieces were scattered in the durt &amp; leaves <br/>
covering it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much for sharing your experience with the rest of us.<br/>

&gt; OK, first of all, yes the hands are fine. I still have a bit of <br/>
&gt; numbness in two fingers on my left hand but I can live with it. As <br/>
&gt; long as it doesn't effect picking the guitar or the mandolin I can <br/>
&gt; live with it...as the doctor said I would have to.<br/>
&gt; Secondly, it is not a headstone. It is behind a grave that is over <br/>
&gt; 100 years old but the original headstone is still there. The rock <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; the clue is a secondary rock that is behind the grave. It is about <br/>
2 <br/>
&gt; feet away, and it is just a piece of limestone. It is an odd <br/>
shape, <br/>
&gt; but it is not "the" or "a" headstone. I would not have tampered <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; a grave, or a grave yard, but as you saw in the clue, it was the <br/>
&gt; only one there. It was the only thing there, but for a few trees. <br/>
&gt; Whoever kept this lone grave sure tended it very well, as they had <br/>
&gt; it mulched and lined with monkey grass. The stone however was a <br/>
&gt; couple feet away from the grave.<br/>

&gt; &gt; That was why I was kind of wondering in the back of my mind if <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; glass<br/>
&gt; &gt; might not have been put there by the placer. I would certainly <br/>
&gt; hope not.<br/>
&gt; &gt; But the fact that the clues said to dig deep under a tall <br/>
&gt; stone........seems<br/>
&gt; &gt; odd. It also seems odd to me that with such a serious <br/>
situation, <br/>
&gt; the placer<br/>
&gt; &gt; said they'd check on it, then not only didn't get back to <br/>
Wendell <br/>
&gt; but also<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn't see fit to go and immediately remove the glass, since the <br/>
&gt; glass was<br/>
&gt; &gt; still there when Wendell returned a few days later. Nor did <br/>
they <br/>
&gt; post any<br/>
&gt; &gt; note in the clues (as of this morning at least) as to what had <br/>
&gt; happened as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; warning.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In a way, given our litigious society, I can see a placer <br/>
deciding <br/>
&gt; not to<br/>
&gt; &gt; contact Wendell again. I would consider that "rude" but an <br/>
&gt; attorney might<br/>
&gt; &gt; advise that. On the other hand, I would have immediately gone <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; removed<br/>
&gt; &gt; the glass or had someone in the area do it and also retired the <br/>
&gt; box from any<br/>
&gt; &gt; websites it was on. Maybe that's overkill but as a placer, I'd <br/>
be <br/>
&gt; very<br/>
&gt; &gt; upset. Or maybe put a big fat note on the clue page. If I was <br/>
&gt; the placer,<br/>
&gt; &gt; if I wasn't the one who put the glass there, I would be rather <br/>
&gt; upset and<br/>
&gt; &gt; would want to be absolutely sure that box was out of commission <br/>
&gt; anyway so<br/>
&gt; &gt; that whoever did do that wouldn't be returning to do it again. <br/>
&gt; But that's<br/>
&gt; &gt; just what I would do. Like I said, maybe others would consider <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; overkill. At the very least, I'd post a warning.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I read the clues and it appears to be a headstone that's over <br/>
100 <br/>
&gt; years old.<br/>
&gt; &gt; But maybe it's in the family of the placer and they have <br/>
&gt; permission to have<br/>
&gt; &gt; put a letterbox there. I wouldn't have done any digging <br/>
&gt; whatsoever either<br/>
&gt; &gt; unless I already knew the placer absolutely had permission from <br/>
&gt; the family,<br/>
&gt; &gt; once I saw that it was a headstone. I take that back. I just <br/>
&gt; would've<br/>
&gt; &gt; walked away period. Being as how it's apparently a 100 year old <br/>
&gt; headstone,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don't think I would have gone after it even if the placer had <br/>
&gt; *had*<br/>
&gt; &gt; permission. I wouldn't have felt right about it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Wendell, is the hand doing OK? What a bummer of a day.<br/>
