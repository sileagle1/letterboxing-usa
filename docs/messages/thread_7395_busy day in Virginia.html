                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds like everyone had a fun Labor Day searching for boxes.  Scott and I found four boxes in Virginia,including the elusive G-Man's Road Rally Box.  We had tried to find it once before, but got a little turned around.  We never found the "Area" clue.  It seems others had the same problem, so I think the "Area" sign has probably gone MIA.  But we found it anyways!<br/>
<br/>
Had a really interesting time getting into Accotink Bay Wildlife Refuge.  The Tully Gate was closed so we had to go through the main entrance to Fort Belvoir.  I found it very interesting that they checked Scott's ID, but not mine.  Then we had to go to the visitor center and get a day pass.  Again, they wanted Scott's ID and not mine.  I guess I have an innocent face!  So much for security!<br/>
<br/>
Also found:<br/>
Virginia Rail<br/>
Aya the Fern<br/>
and MVT series #2 - Riverside Park<br/>
<br/>
All were in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
We started on the wrong trail to find the Riverside Park box, but then saw the right trail below us.  I basically slid down the hill on my butt and miraculously ended up almost exactly where the box was.  Very funny!<br/>
