What about a teddy bear clown?<br/>
<br/>
I was recently given just such a hitchhiker ("The Hitchhiker from<br/>
Hell"), which I summarily deposited in my Hostel and it was picked<br/>
up and given to a person who hates clowns...<br/>

&gt; Wow, I dunno.  Boo Boo Bear HH is pretty durn small.  And he looks<br/>
sorta<br/>
&gt; soft in the belly. He definitely hasn't been attending any Curves<br/>
sessions<br/>
&gt; lately.  I don't think he'd much use at killin' *any*thing.<br/>

Well.............I still have this religious HH in my grasp.  Maybe nobody<br/>
has picked up Boo Boo Bear and given Boo Boo a lift yet.  I could go back up<br/>
to Lake County and put the religious HH with Boo Boo Bear for "protection".<br/>
Anyone comin' lookin' to hurt poor li'l Boo will be damned to hellfire and<br/>
tarnation.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I don't know what Boo Boo's religious sensitivities are.  Boo Boo<br/>
might not want to share a bed with such a fellow HH.  But under the<br/>
circumstances..............when one's life has been threatened..........I<br/>
could leave a note asking folks to make sure Boo Boo and Bodyguard remain<br/>
together.<br/>
