                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just "discovered" this activity this weekend after an article in the <br/>
local paper. (Fortunately OUR paper didn't post details or pics and <br/>
heavily emphasized the secrecy  ascpects.) So my wife and I and our <br/>
sons went out and found 3 easy boxes today. Just store bought stamps <br/>
for now but hey, it's only day one right?<br/>
<br/>
Already wondering how far we'll go because I'm looking at some of the <br/>
more challenging, riddle based clues, and thinking those are gonna <br/>
frustrate the bejeebus outta me. But we'll see.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, only 495 more in Easterm Mass., plus RI and maybe even CT<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we'll even drop a box or two of our own when we get better at <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
See you around.<br/>
<br/>
Leave no Trace.<br/>
