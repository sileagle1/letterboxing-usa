<br/>
Saturday, July 24, 2004<br/>
Time: 10:30am-1:00pm<br/>
Location: Nathaniel Hawthorne House<br/>
Contacts &amp; RSVP: Debbie Blanchard or phyto_me@yahoo.com<br/>
<br/>
What to Bring: something scrumptious &amp; a drink for a potluck picnic<br/>
Your own lawn chair or folding chair (we'll eat outside unless it's raining)<br/>
Your letterbox notebook; personal rubber stamp, ink pad (copies of the trailguides <br/>
will be available for $1.00 as well as a Lakes Region Letterbox Trail stamp book for <br/>
$4.00)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Directions From Portland, Maine take Route 302 West, heading towards Bridgton. <br/>
Continue through Windham &amp; Raymond. Go about 2 miles further and you'll see a <br/>
sign for "Cry of the Loon" gift shop on your left. Take a left onto the Raymond Cape <br/>
Road and proceed about 1/2 mil. Look carefully for a dirt road on your right called, <br/>
"The Captain Dingley Road." Take that right. Go a short distance until the road <br/>
forks. You'll see a ball field area. You can part there. (You may wish to continue first <br/>
about another 1/2 mile down the Raymond Cape Rd. to see where the Hawthorne <br/>
House is located before you park to unload your stuff; there just isn't much space <br/>
for parking there so we've been asked to park at the ballfield.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 There will be 7 letterboxes within a mile of the Hawthorne House that you can do <br/>
by foot!<br/>
