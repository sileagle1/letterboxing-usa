bonus in one of the boxes. Someone left a 10 page "story" called <br/>
Zander Codex. The person explains he is not a letterboxer or <br/>
geocacher, but decided to place these strange pages into my letterbox <br/>
as a solution to whatever this entails. It is 400 lines of text <br/>
written like poetry. <br/>
    I don't know whether this is a clue to something or just junk. <br/>
I've done a search and just about everything  related comes up in <br/>
German. The only other info is a symphonic orchestra or Buffy the <br/>
Vampire in Calif. <br/>
    I'm at a loss. <br/>
    If you are the person or know of the person who placed this, <br/>
please email me off list. <br/>
