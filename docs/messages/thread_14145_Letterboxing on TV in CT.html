                    <div class="plaintext-content">In addition to NBC-30's program on Thursday (7pm), which looks like <br/>
it will have a bit on LB, I just saw a preview for a similar bit on <br/>
CBS (Channel 3) that will air tomorrow night.  It did not give a time <br/>
other than "starting at 5" with the newscast, however there was <br/>
definately a peek at a box that was hidden under a slice of a tree. <br/>
It also looks like they may have a bit of geocaching thrown in the <br/>
mix...as one person on the segment had a handheld GPS unit.   <br/>
<br/>
We'll have to tune in and see what they have to say!!!<br/>
