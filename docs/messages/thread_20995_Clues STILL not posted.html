I posted my clues Sunday, and tried again yesterday.  They showed up <br/>
in the email list but they still haven't shown up on the site.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any idea on if this will be resolved soon?  I see <br/>
that not everyone's having the problem.  Has anyone had any luck <br/>
getting through to the webmaster?  This is the first box I've ever <br/>
planted so I'm excited about getting my clues out there.<br/>

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br/>
<br/>
Try again today.<br/>
<br/>
I was just at the site this morning and got all my editing done as far as <br/>
when our boxes were last found/checked on, and everything worked quite smoothly.  <br/>
Haven't gotten around to listing our new boxes, but that'll come when we have <br/>
more time.  And maybe I'll list 'em one a day -- wouldn't want to risk <br/>
overloading the system.  :-)<br/>
