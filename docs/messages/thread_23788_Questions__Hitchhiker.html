                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, HH's come with stamps - a HH is made up of a stamp and a logbook, in<br/>
some compact sort of container (often a plastic baggie) that will make it<br/>
easier to leave it in a container with a regular box.<br/>
<br/>
Although none of the HH's I've found don't have a return envelope, there's<br/>
nothing to say they can't, except that HH's get a lot of wear and tear and<br/>
the envelope may not be fit to use when the book is full.  If the owner<br/>
wants the HH to come home, they would either contact the last known holder<br/>
and begin that way tracking it down, or post on one of the lists to call it<br/>
back in and the person holding it would email them back privately to arrange<br/>
the return.  The owner would offer to pay the postage and the holder would<br/>
drop it in the mail to the owner.  Alternatively, the finder would contact<br/>
the placer by email using the email address in the logbook and let them know<br/>
the book is full and find out if the owner wants the whole HH returned or<br/>
just the logbook.<br/>
