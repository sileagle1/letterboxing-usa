Doubtful Guests,  Celtic Pride, and all other organixers who put <br/>
together a highly welcoming and exciting event!  Our trips to <br/>
letterboxes will be even more meaningful now.  <br/>
        I regretted our missing the evening event especially after <br/>
Scarab's conscientious assistance in providing good directions and <br/>
helping me to correct my original misinterpretation of the posted <br/>
clues for its location.  (Again, thanks!)  However, it seemed maybe <br/>
the afternoon's events were enough to sufficiently ease my family <br/>
further into this wonderful letterboxing hobby. (BTW-my husband said <br/>
on the way home, "Hmmm...I'll have to try some of my own stamping...I <br/>
could even plant some of the boxes when I run." :)  :)!!!) I was able <br/>
to twist their arms a little more to try a couple of the Glencaryln <br/>
boxes on our way home. One my husband found, the other we gave up on <br/>
(G. Dog Park, MIA? or just too cold to achieve success?).<br/>
        It was a good thing we did not extend the evening any <br/>
further.  Today I am home with a temp of 100.5!   (Oh, my!  But it <br/>
was worth it!!!)  The little one crashed the whole way home and shows <br/>
no signs of illness!<br/>
         Again, thanks for everyone's warmth and inspiration from <br/>
your brilliance and creativity! There was so much talent exhibited in <br/>
so many stamps, Mahjong's incredible handmade books, Scarab's <br/>
Letterbox Book and awesomely creative puzzles, the immense number of <br/>
letterboxes found and journals filled by so many people, etc. In <br/>
addition, I appreciated the tips provided (i.e. "You might not want <br/>
to scratch your face..."-Girlguides,  "Here, try this", putting an <br/>
arrow on the stamp to avoid upsidedown frogs-SamIAm, La Chola's <br/>
transferring methods and more)! <br/>
-Time to go and buy more stamping material!-Wordfried<br/>
