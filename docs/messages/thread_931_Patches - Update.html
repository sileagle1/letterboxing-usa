                    <div class="plaintext-content">The poll was launched a month or two ago, and when I closed it a<br/>
couple of days ago, it looks like many of you got the results but had<br/>
not gotten the notification of the poll earlier.  Sorry about that.<br/>
<br/>
Here's where I think we stand.  There seemed to be quite a bit of<br/>
interest in getting something put together (Patch, Decal,<br/>
Sticker,...).  Currently, we're doing some leg work to figure out the<br/>
finer points on how to pull something like this together.  I'm<br/>
confident something will come of it in the next few months...  Keep<br/>
your eyes on the list.  I'm sure we'll have several more discussion<br/>
threads before something gets finalized.<br/>

PS: Looks like eGroups is having some recent rouble w/ hackers<br/>
getting into their lists... Hope they get it resolced soon.<br/>
