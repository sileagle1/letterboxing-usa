                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hiya all.  Myself (Xeen) and my roomie Whitepaws (Whitey) have just<br/>
gotten hooked to letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Whitey went on vacation on the 7th and I discovered letterboxing quite<br/>
by accident in the late afternoon of the 11th.  I told him about and he<br/>
loved the idea.  About 45 or less minutes later we were standing<br/>
excitedly with our first found letterbox in hand.  It was a short drive<br/>
from where we live up on some trails next to a place we've been to many<br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
We had only run up there (right before it got dark) just to see what it<br/>
was all about.  It was -very- exciting! We didn't have a stamp or<br/>
journal, so later that night we went and got our supplies.  This is a<br/>
nice hobby that doesn't require much more than gas, but we wanted good,<br/>
sturdy journals that would take a lot of abuse.  We went out the next<br/>
day and re-found that box, did our thing, and found 2 more on the same<br/>
trails.<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, we've been boxing all day, everyday since then.  Whitey goes<br/>
back to work tomorrow but we're practically foaming at the mouth to get<br/>
more boxes.  Its like Pokemon ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Its sooo disappointing when there is a missing box, and even moreso<br/>
because it was probably poorly planted.  Sometimes I just want to hunt<br/>
down the Planter and slap 'em around a bit ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We picked up supplies tonight to plant 2 boxes.  We've got a ton of<br/>
places in mind :)<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah... I've started a website on letterboxing.  It doesn't seem that<br/>
there's a whole -lot- of personal letterboxing sites.  So I'm hoping<br/>
that someone will stumble upon it.  Its not really for fellow LBers so<br/>
much as I'm sure you all already know what you need to know but here ya<br/>
go: http://resirem.com/letterboxing/     it'll be updated probably quite<br/>
a bit with other tips and tricks throughout this week.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.  I've rambled a lot. <br/>
<br/>
Shutting up now.<br/>

Just an FYI there are a actually quite a few personal websites out <br/>

great.  Our's isn't quite as nice but here it is <br/>

Hehe... We were on 2 trails this weekend that had elements of danger. <br/>
One was a cougar area and we were trying to get out before it was his<br/>
dinner time.  The other one was a park with trails we've been to<br/>
before..  Unfortunately its turned into a dangerous area for meth users<br/>
(is this meth problem running rampant outside of Oregon, too?!).  Just<br/>
the day before, I guess they broke into some guys car in less than 10<br/>
minutes.  So we left the truck unlocked, glove compartment box open. <br/>
The most valuable things I owed were on me - letterboxing journal and my<br/>
knitting LOL.  Also there was a sign posted that there was a cougar in<br/>
the area. <br/>
<br/>
Honestly I think I'd rather face a cougar than some crack heads.<br/>
<br/>
So our note on that particular box was "crackheads, breakins and<br/>
cougars, oh my!".  Then we started cracking jokes about a cougar that<br/>
ate a crackhead and how the cougar would come and mug us for our camera LOL.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't faced any wildlife other than deer.  What did you do about the<br/>
bear? Did s/he see you?<br/>

Holy moly! I never even thought of porcupines in our area! Now you makeme want to take an outdoors survival course LOL-XeenJars Of Clay wrote:&gt; we were walking along the edge of an orchard and he was too busy chomping on some apples so we were able to make it back out. *phew* luckily we weren't actually that far from the car...though we did run into a porcupine on the way out....and no joke we should have taken the hint when a coyote ran accross the field on our way in....and I quote "ooh I wonder what else we'll see!" can anyone say der?&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br/>
