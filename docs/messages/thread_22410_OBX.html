Just got back from the Outer Banks (NC). Stayed at a<br/>
nice campground (Cape Woods) in Buxton which is about<br/>
1 mile south of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse (small<br/>
and very quiet...actually saw the Milky Way which we<br/>
can't see her in Baltimore). We (hubby, dog, and I)<br/>
visited many of the sights and found a number of the<br/>
letterboxes...word of caution though, if you look for<br/>
the one at Cape Hatteras Lighthouse beware of ticks! I<br/>
plucked about 20 of the little buggers from my ankles<br/>
and socks that looked like specs of sand...luckily<br/>
none had attached to my skin yet...I think...still<br/>
looking for the tell-tale sign of a bulls-eye<br/>
rash...will know in a few days or so. What a fabulous<br/>
week! No rain, nice letterboxes, and met a bunch of<br/>
nice folks from Canada, Kentucky, Virginia, and NC.<br/>
The ocean water was down right hot on Thursday! Going<br/>
out in the ocean I was able to still see my toes in<br/>
waist-deep water!<br/>
