Last year I floated the idea with a few letterboxers on heading up a trip there.<br/>
I have already contacted the Dartmoor Talk List and they were very enthusiastic, as were other letterboxers. <br/>
Could you imagine a joint gathering with letterboxers from England &amp; the US?<br/>
Ok - now back to work!!<br/>
Leader of the Pack was our first volunteer to go on the trip.<br/>

Have fun and get out there and box!!!<br/>

I am a transplant form Plymouth, Devon, about 15 miles form Dartmoor, spent <br/>
several years letterboxing there. Now living in TN, if you are planning on <br/>
going a really good time would be the weekend that the clock changes, either <br/>
forwards or backwards, there is a meeting where letterboxers from all over the <br/>
country come and buy supplies, clue sheets and exchange clues. They always have <br/>
about a dozen or more special walks put out for theses meetings, they stay out <br/>
for 6 months and then are replaced for the next meeting. <br/>
This is an excellent time to go.<br/>
