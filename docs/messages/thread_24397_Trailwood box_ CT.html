I was walking at the Trailwood sanctuary in Hampton, CT today, and I<br/>
found what looks like an old letterbox. It is in a screw top plastic<br/>
bottle. It only has only one entry in the log book, from 2001. It only <br/>
has some first names in the log, no trail names, and no stamp images.  <br/>
There is no indication of the box name or who planted it.  It has<br/>
a store bought stamp and a coloring marker. It is located next to a <br/>
stream near the Hired Hand's Monument.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone recognize the description or location? Does anyone know of<br/>
any abandonded boxes there? The two clues that are on<br/>
letterboxing.org, Trailwoods Back Door and One Honary Cowboy, are in<br/>
different parts of the preserve. It seems to me there were more boxes<br/>
at Trailwoods at one time.<br/>
<br/>
I posted this on the LBNE group last week and no one had any ideas.  If <br/>
no one recognizes it, I will recover it. Maybe I will replant it<br/>
with new clues.<br/>
