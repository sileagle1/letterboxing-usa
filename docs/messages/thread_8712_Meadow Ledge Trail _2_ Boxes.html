&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the west pass through the intersection of Rt.44 and 169 and take<br/>
&gt; your first left onto Bosworth Rd. From the east on 101, before you get<br/>
&gt; to the intersection of 169 you will pass the Dept. of Transportation.<br/>
&gt; Take the right, onto Bosworth Rd. You will travel .3 of a mile.Turn in<br/>
&gt; on the right and park on the grass. You will see a sign, Walking Trail. <br/>
&gt; Take the path and go across the grassy field. Soon you pass a group of<br/>
&gt; trees growing from the same trunk with a stone wall that goes off to the<br/>
&gt; left. Keep on the path. Then you will come to a sign stating Hidden<br/>
&gt; Meadow, just keep on going. After crossing the meadow, enter the woods.<br/>
&gt; The trail will bend to the left. There's a sign on the right saying<br/>
&gt; Mashamoquet Brook. There's a bench on the left where you can sit and<br/>
&gt; enjoy the brook, next to a black birch tree. 15 paces up the trail<br/>
&gt; there's a tree with 3 sisters growing and a 4th one that fell over. Your<br/>
&gt; prize is in the <br/>
&gt; middle, covered with sticks and leaves.<br/>
&gt; Contiue on to the second box. Soon there will be a stone wall. Follow a<br/>
&gt; little ways with the wall on your right. Shortly after the trail gets<br/>
&gt; real small and tricky to follow. Look for the dark blue blazes painted<br/>
&gt; on the trees. The trail will bend to the river and then bare left up a<br/>
&gt; steep hill. There are rock ledges in the distance off to the left, and<br/>
&gt; there will be another stone wall with a sign saying Wyndham Land Trust.<br/>
&gt; Follow the blue blazes up the steep hill, when you get to the top you<br/>
&gt; come to a T. Take a left here. From the T, count 11 paces. A huge<br/>
&gt; boulder is on your left, and to your right is another big boulder with a<br/>
&gt; tree that splits into sisters growing out it.Walk through the opening of<br/>
&gt; the stone wall to get to the boulder. Go to the back side of the boulder<br/>
&gt; and hidden in a crevice in the rock , under a piece of old log and<br/>
&gt; sticks is your second letterbox. Go back to the trail. Continue on the<br/>
&gt; trail along the stone wall. You will come to another T. Take a right<br/>
&gt; into an overgrown field.Then there will be a Y with a sign saying<br/>
&gt; Wright's Crossing Rd.,but you stay straight, around the edge of the<br/>
&gt; field. The trail will bend back into the woods, and then the trail will<br/>
&gt; bend left, right and then left again back into another overgrown field.<br/>
&gt; There will be an open area, go to the right and follow down alittle<br/>
&gt; more. You will come to a cornfield. Take a left and follow all the way<br/>
&gt; down on the edge of the cornfield. Soon there will be a bar way that<br/>
&gt; will take you into another cornfield. Just follow the tire marks all the<br/>
&gt; way across the field and back to the road and your car. These trails are<br/>
&gt; all part of the Audubon Society and the farmers rent the land from them.<br/>
&gt; This is not farm land;this is part of the Bafflin Nature Sanctuary.<br/>
