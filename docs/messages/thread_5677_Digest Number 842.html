&gt; This is a temporary solution.  The list can decide what the long term<br/>
&gt; solution should be.  Note that this particular worm is designed to<br/>
&gt; be around a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Just for the record, I was making a suggestion to set it to moderate a <br/>
member's first post because I didn't realize you had it set so that <br/>
-anyone- could post.  I thought that these were people joining the list, <br/>
posting, and then leaving -- and since there's an option via Yahoo to <br/>
moderate ONLY SOMEONE'S FIRST POST, as you'll note my post mentioned <br/>
quite clearly, so that this wouldn't happen.<br/>
<br/>
However, since you did have it set so that anyone could post without <br/>
being a member of the group, well, that explains it.<br/>
<br/>
And also, I was in internet security for quite some time myself.  I'm <br/>
running a linux box here at home and -don't- have vulnerable software <br/>
(as, I believe, was implied), and I was hardly whining about the posts <br/>
coming through since, really, they don't affect me.  I just know that of <br/>
the last five digests I've received, roughly 10% of the messages have <br/>
been spam or viruses, and I thought perhaps you'd like to attempt to fix <br/>
that, rather than subjecting some of themembers who -aren't- as <br/>
digitally-aware to the possiblity of viruses.<br/>
<br/>
Pardon me if I've overstepped my bounds.  I'll go back to lurking now.<br/>
