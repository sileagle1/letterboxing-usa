Since I've been interested in letterboxing I have been nothing but<br/>
pleased and impressed by the website design and the handling of clues,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
As far as secret societies and the like, I really doubt it's like that.<br/>
I for one appreciate the webheads going to their own list to for<br/>
discussions of the nuts &amp; bolts technical stuff.  This list is for the<br/>
letterboxing hobby itself, as far as I'm concerned.  I don't want my<br/>
e-mail cluttered with fascinating conversations about HTML and the<br/>
virtues of one server over another.  <br/>
<br/>
If it ain't broke don't fix it and I for one, think this list and the<br/>
website are purring like a kitten (most of the time -- except for the<br/>
occasional growls by people from some of the hot topics taking place<br/>
here lately).<br/>
