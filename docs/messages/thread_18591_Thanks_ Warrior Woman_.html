"&gt; I guess it would be pretty obvious if you placed it in someone <br/>
else's box, but what if one wanted to start one in their own box? Is <br/>
that legit?<br/>
Assume the zen lotus position and chant along with me - "there are no <br/>
rules...there are no rules...there are no rules..." ;-)<br/>
I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this, but I have two <br/>
interpretations:<br/>
1. You want to start a HH with its *own* plastic (or whatever) box? <br/>
Size is the issue here again. I've seen lots of HHs in their own <br/>
box, sometimes a microbox inside a film canister, sometimes in a <br/>
sandwich sized rubbermaid container. It is doable (heck, <br/>
letterboxers are pretty creative folks), but the challenge is where <br/>
to replant it. Depending on where you hunt for LBs, there may be <br/>
plenty of room in the hiding spot for the original LB and the extra <br/>
container HH. Or not. But like I said, we like challenges!<br/>
2. You want to launch a HH in one of your own established permanent <br/>
letterboxes. Heck, I do that all the time! In fact, I made a <br/>
deliberate choice of location for one particular permanent LB of mine <br/>
that is a hitchhiker magnet because the hiding place could hold three <br/>
normal sized letterboxes! A few more of my permanent boxes have the <br/>
larger type of container (rectangular) so they can accommodate even <br/>
the larger 3X5 logbook type HH. (Okay, okay, I confess - I made <br/>
these special larger hiding places/larger containers on purpose <br/>
because I found myself carrying around larger sized HHs for weeks on <br/>
end (tsk! tsk!) because in my travels I could not find a place to <br/>
replant them. So now I have a failsafe - if all else fails, I <br/>
replant the larger HHs in these larger LBs of my own. Okay, my <br/>
secret is out!)<br/>
I hope this post has made you laugh, given you some tips, reinforced <br/>
the "there are no rules" philosophy, and given you the boost to "go <br/>
for it".<br/>
Happy boxing,<br/>
