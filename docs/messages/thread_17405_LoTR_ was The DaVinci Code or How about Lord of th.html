                    <div class="plaintext-content">  Tolkein spent a lot of time developing the Middle Earth world, and the actual writing of the trilogy was a byproduct - or was it vice-versa :)  His childrens' stories are great stuff, and the children wanted more each year.  It's particularly cute that there are a lot of teenagers who've seen the movies (but not read the books) who think they discovered Tolkein.<br/>

  The Lord of the rings is fiction and we all know it. I was told Tolkien<br/>
  spent approx ten years in the creation and writing of the story of middle<br/>
  earth.  It is fascinating piece of work.   I do not normally like fiction<br/>
  but because of the research and  how it was  inspired it has captured my<br/>
  attention.  The DaVinci Code is trying to pass as non-fiction but is just<br/>
  another heresy.  If you like things that tickle your ears then I suppose you<br/>
  would find the DaVinci Code interesting.  Stories like the DaVinci Code are<br/>
  as old as Christianity itself.  Another heresy that has captured people is<br/>
  The Left Behind series is another one  that if you are not well read in<br/>
  the truth will capture your attention.<br/>
