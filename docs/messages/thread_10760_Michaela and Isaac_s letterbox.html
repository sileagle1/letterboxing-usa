&gt;Subject: Michaela and Isaac's letterbox<br/>
&gt;Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2003 15:35:09 -0800<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My name is Christine Stewart.  My family has hidden a new letterbox on <br/>
&gt;Blanchard Hill.  It is in Washington state in Whatcom County, near <br/>
&gt;Bellingham.  My children are 7 and 5 and are very excited about this new <br/>
&gt;activity.<br/>
&gt;      You take the I-5, south of Bellingham, to the Alger exit #240.  Go <br/>
&gt;west on that road.  Go left at Barrell Springs Rd.  Pass Shaw Rd and turn <br/>
&gt;right at B-1000 Rd.  It says Blanchard Hill on the sign.  Drive up the hill <br/>
&gt;past the first parking lot.  Keep going all the way up to the second <br/>
&gt;parking area.  Walk back down the hill to the Lily and Lizard Lake trail.  <br/>
&gt;Follow the trail across a bridge.  The trail comes to a Y; follow the more <br/>
&gt;obvious curve to the right.  Follow the trail up the hill until you come to <br/>
&gt;a creek bed that the trail crosses.  Across the creek, there is a huge <br/>
&gt;stump to the left, up the hill a bit.  The box is tucked under a root <br/>
&gt;towards the right and back of the stump.<br/>
&gt;      I hope we did a good job!  I think it is not quite two miles in, but <br/>
&gt;we are not sure.  We look forward to finding all the other boxes in our <br/>
&gt;area!!  Christine Stewart<br/>
