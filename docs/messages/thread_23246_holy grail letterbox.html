My personal "Holy Grail" box is Mapsurfer's A Bard's Tale<br/>
letterbox located somewhere in Colorado.  It has eluded my<br/>
understanding for over 3 years.<br/>

You mean YOU haven't found it yet?  With all your Mapsurfery?<br/>
Maybe it's less of a Holy Grail and more of a... I don't know...Bigfoot?  Loch Ness Monster?<br/>

If Randy gave help with his boxes, the treasure that be holds you would <br/>
not be so sweet. The fact is, when (and IF) you ever find his box, you <br/>
will feel joy that you have never felt in finding a letterbox. Thats <br/>
just part of the game.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, Ive not even chosen to attempt a Mapsurfer Treasure box <br/>
yet. My holy grail's have collectively been many of the Jay Drew and <br/>
Eric The Ram boxes here in CT. All have been VERY rewarding.<br/>

i have been known to place a bonus box along the same trail as another of my<br/>
boxes. but you will only find it if you read the log book.<br/>
we found blue bears adventure a couple of years back. while reading the log<br/>
book we noticed that a hithchhiker was planted near by. being to big for the<br/>
letterbox someone had left it in the stone wall near by. we looked, but<br/>
really was not expecting it to be there as that little notice was a year old<br/>
and at least a dozen stampers later. well, it was there! a teamgreendragon<br/>
hitchhiker and a special treat to find. <br/>
so read those logbooks.<br/>
besides i love looking for wanda and petes stamp. you guys rock!<br/>

<br/>
I'm often mis-quoted.  Sometimes you have to consider the source, as<br/>
well as the reporter ...<br/>
<br/>
One thing that is funny about writing books is dealing with editors.<br/>
You often have fights, including whether or not to include solutions.<br/>
Fortunately that one was won.  In fact, the only fight I lost was<br/>
the editor's insistence that the line "the legerdemain that goes<br/>
on can be mind-bending", hit the cutting room floor.  I guess you<br/>
have to understand the context(s), but boy was I pissed and went<br/>
round and round on that one ...<br/>

Back to the thread, I have a box that is actually a holy grail, a<br/>
poorly-carved one at that, but I guess that is part of the charm.<br/>
I believe Pete and Wanda have found it.  Of course, all the stamps<br/>
are poorly carved -- I think people like the fact that they stick<br/>
out like sore thumbs in their journals.  But you should see the one<br/>
TGD carved for me ...<br/>
<br/>
My favorite letterbox is probably Mink River, in Wisconsin.  I wonder<br/>
if it is still there.  1999 was a long time ago, but tupperware has a<br/>
long half-life.  I would only say that off season, when the paddling<br/>
concession is closed, but it is quite a fun concept, and one we hope<br/>
to copycat someday ...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And the fact that he gives NO HELP is, well... no help at all.<br/>
<br/>
What sort of help would you like?<br/>
<br/>
We have these yes/no cards.  They allow their holder to ask three<br/>
yes/no questions, which I answer truthfully if I know or remember<br/>
the answer.  I've always wondered why a particular holder of one<br/>
has not used this on a particular box in a particular state with a<br/>
particularly long name ...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I took one of Mapsurfer's clues to a cryptography expert in the <br/>
 &gt; US Gov't.  He glanced at it and said, "Book Code.  You're on your<br/>
 &gt; own."<br/>
<br/>
Gee, which box is this?  I didn't realise I had a book code.  I'm<br/>
impressed that someone would take a letterbox clue to a cryptography<br/>
expert, and particularly flattered it would be one that I came up<br/>
with.  I guess that means I have to raise the bar, tho I am certainly<br/>
aware of a particular government expert that works my clues.<br/>
<br/>
(And it amazes me that people even deal with my boxes with 22000 out<br/>
there and the lame stamps.  In the days when there were only 20<br/>
or so, people had no choice :-))<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how much, if any, I've contributed to the positive<br/>
karma of this thread, but I do know I've set a record for the use<br/>
of the word "particular" and its various morphemes (and y'know<br/>
what, the spell checker nailed just about each one -- a particularly<br/>
difficult spelling word for me).<br/>
<br/>
Well, I have a streak going of planting at least one box for 7<br/>
consecutive years, not impressive by others' PFXYZ stats, but something<br/>
worth keeping alive this spring, I suppose ...<br/>
<br/>

The Mink River box IS alive and well and still a favorite of many WI <br/>
letterboxers.  I believe it is nearing or on its second logbook.  I <br/>
will be checking on it once again next week.<br/>
<br/>
As keeper of the "WI Letterboxes of Antiquity" <br/>
(http://www.geocities.com/the_lb_dragon/AntiquityHome.htm) I'd welcome <br/>
the chance to discuss with you any other boxes from WI you may have <br/>
found back in 1999.  Please email me privately if you're willing.<br/>

Your book got me started after I found my first box.  I kept it in the <br/>
sitting room for over a year and many people borrowed it - sitting <br/>
room - hmmmm - where might that be?<br/>

&gt; We found  Mink River in AUG 2004 and had quite an interesting hike getting<br/>
&gt; there!  (We definitely took the long way...)  Someone also found it in AUG<br/>
&gt; 2005, so I believe it is probably still in place.  Did you plant it?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, this is fantastic news, on a few fronts.  I did not plant it,<br/>
but of course wish I had.  I do not believe anyone has yet found<br/>
my only Wisconsin box (the drop was difficult (and I had a flight to<br/>
catch), and the likelyhood that it is still there is low, but it<br/>
doesn't mean the puzzle still can't be solved and the area enjoyed).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Well, I have a streak going of planting at least one box for 7 consecutive <br/>
 &gt; years<br/>
<br/>
Actually 8 years.  Hey, when your stats are lame, you take what you<br/>
can get ...<br/>
<br/>
 &gt; How may one obtain one of these [yes/no] cards?<br/>
<br/>
I'm getting alot of this ...<br/>
<br/>
The easiest way is single malt scotch, and we are particularily<br/>
fond of a (besides this word) particular _I_sland.  Or get one<br/>
from someone who has has one and doesn't feel like using it.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, we generally give them out for solving trivia questions,<br/>
which, in this day and age, means giving them to those who are<br/>
most adept with search engines and high-speed connections.  Or,<br/>
of course you can always find them in the boxscape or do something<br/>
I think is cool.<br/>
<br/>
Well, here are the trivia questions.  First correct answer to each<br/>
can have one, if they want (please e-mail off-list if you answer).<br/>
They are tradeable, so if you don't want one, you can trade it to<br/>
someone who does, of course --<br/>
<br/>
* what is the cos(i), where i*i = -1, and "cos" is the well-known<br/>
trig function, to a couple of decimal places?<br/>
<br/>
* what is the largest prime number in the lyrics of a popular song<br/>
[that I've heard, or provide me the mp3]?<br/>
<br/>
* who invented the term "geocaching"?<br/>
<br/>
* what is both a language, beverage, and island?<br/>
<br/>

These things go fast, I'm afraid.  All the questions have been<br/>
correctly answered, but I forgot to mention one to a customer,<br/>
except for the<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The easiest way is single malt scotch<br/>
<br/>
Of course :-) This means one of the correctly answered<br/>
questions is still alive.  I'm posting the answers to<br/>
the other 3 following.  This was kinda fun, so I may put<br/>
some longer term puzzles on my website at some point for<br/>
these things, we'll see.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; * what is the cos(i), where i*i = -1, and "cos" is the well-known<br/>
