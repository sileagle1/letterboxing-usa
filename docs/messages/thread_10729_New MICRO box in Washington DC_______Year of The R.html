<br/>
Chinese Lunar New Year 2003<br/>
Year of the Ram Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE use caution when retrieving/replacing this box;<br/>
as it is in a very public place.<br/>
<br/>
When you visit Washington DC,<br/>
Chinatown is a place one must see!<br/>
<br/>
On the corner of 7th and H you will see a large arch,<br/>
this is where your journey will start!<br/>
<br/>
As you walk under the arch remember the year,<br/>
2003 symbols that the RAM is near!<br/>
<br/>
Looking to your left you will see a sign not new, <br/>
written upon it is 80 P2 X2!<br/>
<br/>
These are not letterboxing numbers to gaze upon,<br/>
yet they are numbers of navigation!<br/>
<br/>
As you sit near the numbers it may seem as a tease,<br/>
look at the arch to your NorthEast!<br/>
<br/>
Count 1, 2, 3 support beams from the arch,<br/>
and you will see where I am!<br/>
<br/>
Purched above your head towards the heavens,<br/>
you will find your festive Ram!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the hunt.........BOX THE GLOBE!<br/>
<br/>
If you find the above mentioned box damaged,<br/>
destroyed, or missing PLEASE notify me. NewBe1<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Newbe1, I enjoyed my visit to Chinatown in honor of the Chinese <br/>
Lunar new year.  It is always worth the trip to Chinatown to pass <br/>
under the arch.  Very nice stamp.  I would say it was a challenging <br/>
microbox but somehow I radared right to it.  I will be interested to <br/>
hear how others fare.  It was fun.<br/>
<br/>
By the way the numbers are 80 P6 X2 and not P"2".<br/>
<br/>
Be discreet?!  While you are doing something your Mother would yell <br/>
at you for?!  You know what I mean.  It must have looked very <br/>
amusing trying to act non-chalant while retreiving and replacing <br/>
this one.  Actually I think I did pretty well.  I felt like a young <br/>
guy on a movie date looking elsewhere while non-chalantly reaching <br/>
with my arm in a different direction.<br/>
<br/>
Because it was snowing (yeah I'm crazy) I went into CVS to stamp in, <br/>
using some boxes as a table.  <br/>
<br/>
I am almost surprised I didn't run into Mary from Virginia looking <br/>
for the microbox too.  Well except for the snow.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the fun,<br/>
