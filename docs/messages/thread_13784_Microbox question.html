                    <div class="plaintext-content">Concerning log books: I like to take a large sheet of thin paper, like paper <br/>
on rolls of newsprint, and cut a rather large sheet, maybe 12" X 18". I then <br/>
fold it in thirds or quarters, lengthwise then fold it enough times the other <br/>
way until I can roll it to fit the film canister or whatever. This way, the <br/>
finder can unfold the paper and stamp whatever size stamp he/she has anywhere it <br/>
fits. (I have found log books so small I cannot fit my 1 1/4 X 2" signature <br/>
stamp in them.) <br/>
<br/>
The added bonus of this is you have quite a nice, practically framable log <br/>
when enough stampers have logged in!<br/>

<br/>
Right-o-! <br/>
That's exactly what I'm contemplating.<br/>
Thanks so much for the ideas and size dimensions. Very helpful!<br/>
Another thought might be my patented (ha!) stamp scroll... well, not <br/>
yet perfected, and has the disadvantage of size restrictions, but it <br/>
still keeps the stamp log/paper on a flat surface for stampers.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many ways to approach this - I think it's just trial and <br/>
error in this case. Thanks again - look for the scroll stamper soon!<br/>

at the CT Gerbil Gathering. Each evil dictator sub-hitchhiker was a<br/>

was handmade type of paper that was folded in half widthwise but very<br/>
long. The width was only about slightly smaller than the height of the<br/>
film container, but the length was very long. Once it was folded in half<br/>
widthwise, the eraser/stamp was wrapped inside of the log sheet which<br/>
wrapped over and over around the stamp and fit snugly in the film<br/>
container. This made for a very effecient yet usable log sheet.<br/>

You may want to take a look at the pics of a microbox and minibox <br/>
which can be found under the "photos" button at the left.  Go to the <br/>
second page, and you will find those pics.<br/>
