I don't want to sound authoritarian or anything, but from what I've <br/>
learned you aren't supposed to tell where you leave the HH. However, <br/>
since Georgia is somewhat lacking in lboxing, I will take your <br/>
information as an invitation to visit your boxes in north GA. I've had <br/>
you on my list, so my pace has increased.<br/>
Thanks for the strange heads-up,<br/>

was just going by what I do with travel bugs when geocaching....<br/>
thought that the hitchiker planter might be interested in knowing <br/>
where the hitchiker was located.<br/>
<br/>
I will be delighted if you can visit the GA letterboxes...some have <br/>
been visited several times, others little.  Also, if you can plant a <br/>
few or help to publicize letterboxing in Georgia, I would personally <br/>
be grateful.  Letterboxing is such a delightful, invigorating <br/>
experience...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your response...<br/>
