<div>Hike: Approximately 20-30 minutes along Cedar Creek, with some scrambling 
over downed trees and boulders.Watch out for ticks, stinging nettle, and 
clustered masses of Coccinellidae among the rocks and trees.</div>
<div>Directions: From Kernville drive southwest to Wofford Heights and take 
Highway 155 west to the summit of the Greenhorn Range. Continue past the summit 
for about 3 miles to Cedar Creek Campground. There are picnic tables and porta 
potties near the parking area. Find the trail that heads up stream. You will see 
two shallow cave/mine shafts on the right side of the trail. Walk a bit more and 
you will see a 30 ft. waterfall. Scramble up the left side of the waterfall, and 
you will pass by other smaller falls and pools. At the last pool (approx. 15ft. 
x 12 ft.) and falls cross the creek and continue up stream.</div>
<div>Keep the creek on your left, scrambling over a 
series of downed trees.. Look for the first true 
"fork" in the creek.It will be about a 10 minute walk from the last pool. At the 
"fork" you will see a definite side canyon coming in from your right. Stand at 
the fork and look upstream for a large letter "V" formed by a tree stump on the 
left side of the main channel of Cedar Creek. Go to the base of the stump by the 
creek and take 4 paces upstream, then turn 90 degrees to the left. Take 5 paces 
up the bank and you will see 2 boulders forming a mouthlike crevice. Reach into 
the mouth of the giant, and tip the rectangular right "molar" in the giant's 
mouth to retrieve the letterbox.</div>
<div>After finding this letterbox look to where X marks 
the spot.</div></body></html>
