&gt;Has anyone found this box lately?  It was planted quite a while ago (18 mos<br/>
&gt;maybe) and is an orphan box on the site.  I didn't find anything other than <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;mass of poison ivy and since I already have some, did not go digging for it<br/>
&gt;among the PI.  Just curious as to it's status.  If it's there I think <br/>
&gt;I'llwait<br/>
&gt;till fall and a few freezes to go back.<br/>
