Back from a wonderful little vacation on the Cape this weekend...JLR and<br/>
I managed to find quite a few boxes while we were there!  We found: the<br/>
Nauset Light, Three Sisters Lighthouses, Highland (Cape Cod) Light,<br/>
Chatham Light, Reunion, and the Race Point Light.  All were in good<br/>
condition.  The Race Point lighthouse was quite a trek!  But a beautiful<br/>
walk on the beach, and it sure wasn't crowded, being March and below 40<br/>
degrees!  Be sure and make time for this one if you make it out to the<br/>
Cape anytime soon.  It took us a little over two hours, but was<br/>
definitely worth it!  On the way back, we also managed to swing by the<br/>
Birdhouse letterbox in Needham.  Boy was this one a kick!  Another one<br/>
to make time for if you're in the area.<br/>
<br/>
The plan was to stop in Leominster on the way home (route 2 is soooo<br/>
much nicer than the Masspike!) but it was a bit too cold and snowy for<br/>
letterboxing.  Next time!<br/>
<br/>
A question: Anyone (besides MaFishes ;) seen the Sockeye Salmon<br/>
Hitchhiker lately?<br/>
<br/>
That's it!<br/>
