                    <div class="plaintext-content">Has anyone out there placed any letterboxes that might require the <br/>
hunter to have some type of special skills. An example might be one <br/>
that required rock climbing skills and equipment. If such boxes do <br/>
exist, I would think they must obviously be clearly identified in the <br/>
clue and instructions only for trained individuals to attempt them.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I have never done any rock climbing and don't really have <br/>
any interest in that particular sport. However, I always been <br/>
somewhat of a monkey in the trees since I was a kid. I recently <br/>
discovered a recreational tree climbing sport (www.treeclimbing.com) <br/>
that uses much of the same approach and equipment that rock climbing <br/>
does but claims to be much safer (no serious injuries in 13 years of <br/>
the sport by persons with adequate traing and equipment). I expect I <br/>
will try to get trained sometime this year if possible. I was toying <br/>
with the idea of placing a box or two way up in the top of some <br/>
trees. However, ultimately I probably will not do it just because of <br/>
concerns about being sued (regardless of disclaimers) if some <br/>
untrained bozo were to attempt it without adequate equipment and get <br/>
hurt.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Very interesting. My boyfriend has jokingly(?) suggested several <br/>
times "extreme letterboxing" which would be about what you propose. I <br/>
myself had been thinking of placing a box in a location which is a <br/>
few miles up logging trails accessible by 4x4--but I didn't want <br/>
someone inexperienced in off-road driving taking their Ford <br/>
Expedition up the trail.  In the end, we decided that to keep up our <br/>
end of the "deal," we couldn't put boxes in places that LBhunters <br/>
could endanger themselves if unprepared. I mean, we're all hikers, it <br/>
seems, but to add other necessary skills may get some people into <br/>
trouble.<br/>
