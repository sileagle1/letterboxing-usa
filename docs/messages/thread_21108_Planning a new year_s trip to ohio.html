We are heading towards the Chillicothe area over the holiday.  We <br/>
were in Bainbridge for the Festival of Leaves back in October.  We <br/>
had no idea there were so many boxes in that area, but then we didn't <br/>
know about letterboxing then either.  We are excited as we haven't <br/>
done this before.  We decided not to place our first box until we see <br/>
how others look.<br/>
<br/>
We are excited to get started.  We are hoping for good weather that <br/>
weekend so we can make the trip.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone has a good holiday!<br/>
<br/>

I hope you get good weather. I actually spent Labor Day weekend <br/>
traveling from Indianapolis to Columbus, then Chillicothe, <br/>
Portsmouth, through Cincinnati and then back to Indy. Just me and my <br/>
dog, letterboxing away. Chillicothe is a great spot, but don't <br/>
forget to stop at Scioto Trails State Park, just south of <br/>
Chillicothe. There are several boxes there. If you are coming up and <br/>
can pass through Portsmouth, there are at least 4 good boxes there <br/>
and a few in the Waverly area, between Portsmouth and Chillicothe. <br/>
All are pretty accessible from Rt. 23. You will find a mixture of <br/>
hand-carved and store-bought stamps in Chillicothe. What a great way <br/>
to bring in the new year!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What fun!  We spent boxing day there last year and had absolutely perfect<br/>
weather, tho this year's forecast is not as promising.  Be sure to do a bit<br/>
of prep work and you will walk away with beacoup boxes.  I think my fave<br/>
spot was Grandview cemetery.  <br/>
<br/>
This year, we are spending boxing day (+1) in Indy and hope to have an<br/>
enjoyable experience.<br/>

I hope you do enjoy Indy! I have seen the area grow significantly in <br/>
the year I've been letterboxing. We have an enthusiastic bunch of <br/>
letterboxers in the area who have populated the Indy area with a <br/>
wide variety of boxes. Have fun!<br/>
