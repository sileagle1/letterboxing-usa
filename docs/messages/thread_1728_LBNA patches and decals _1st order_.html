  the first order of patches and decals has been sent out .... Finally.  <br/>
Sorry I didn't get to it last week ( the flu went through our home in waves). <br/>
 :oP<br/>
<br/>
   I included refunds for the P &amp; F merit badges.  There weren't enough to <br/>
make a bulk order.  Possibly the next bulk order could include them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much everybody.  We are looking for matching caps and hiking hats <br/>
to put ours on this week.   <br/>
<br/>
Mohmers, In much too snowy and frozen Illinois.<br/>
