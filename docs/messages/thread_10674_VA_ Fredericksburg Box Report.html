<br/>
Members of the Bobcat Crew took me to the Phelps Wildlife Management<br/>
Area for the Bamboo Gone Wild and Big Dead Tree boxes. Both were very<br/>
picturesque walks. At Bamboo Gone Wild, we stamped in while sitting on<br/>
a huge rock by the Rappahannock River. While leaving the Big Dead Tree<br/>
box, a flock of geese noisily alighted in the pond beside the parking<br/>
lot. Bonnie was captivated.<br/>
<br/>
We were able to snag the Fish or Fowl box at Curtis Park before<br/>
Susan's tire started going flat. She had to beat a hasty retreat to<br/>
get that checked out, so then Bonnie and I were on our own for the<br/>
afternoon. Be afraid, be very afraid!<br/>
<br/>
We went first to Dead Snellings and Weeds. Again, I stamped into this<br/>
one while sitting right by the Rappahannock. This area reminded me<br/>
very much of Pony Pasture Park on the James River here in Richmond.<br/>
The clues say that this area is very busy in the summer; I can believe<br/>
it, it was so nice down there!<br/>
<br/>
We ended the day at St. Claire Brooks Park. We only snagged one of its<br/>
two boxes because the bridge to the second box was closed and I got us<br/>
a little turned around trying to approach that box from the other<br/>
direction. Some how I ended up walking down a path that came out into<br/>
a whole 'nother park, Pratt Park! Useful bit of info for my next<br/>
foray, because there's a box at that park, too.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, we finally backtracked successfully to the car and made it<br/>
home in time for "Monarch of the Glen." Thanks again to the Bobcat<br/>
Crew for the great company and to all those boxers who planted boxes<br/>
in such fabulous spots!<br/>
