I have to share my frustration.  My 8-year old son and I planted our first set of boxes last weekend.  Some nice boxer e-mailed me yesterday to tell me the last one has been stolen.  He found the first 2 but he only found the empty box in the last spot.  The logbook and stamp were gone.  He was our first finder so we didn't lose a bunch of cool stamps.  I'll replace the book and stamp today but how do I keep it from happening again?  I thought it was hidden well enough from anybody walking by.  Another letterboxer wouldn't do this would they?<br/>

Hi Shelly<br/>
<br/>
I doubt that a letterboxer removed the letterbox. There is a <br/>
learning curve for planting letterboxes in good locations and since <br/>
you indicated that this was your first set of boxes then that may be <br/>
the problem.<br/>
Having said that, even seasoned letterboxers have their letterboxes <br/>
go missing and get vandalized. You might try hiding one box rather <br/>
than a series.<br/>

<br/>
  We were just out hunting for a series the other day and discovered that one of them was 'missing.'  All the pouches were well hidden by a seasoned planter in a heavily wooded area with small dirt paths.  We refused to give up on the missing pouch as we couldn't believe that another boxer would vandalize it and it couldn't have been accidently discovered.  We eventually found all the pieces, covered with wee puncture marks, soaked with rain, and hidden under heavy brush.  It appeared that a 'resident' (probably a chipmunk or squirrel) had found the pouch, chewed mightily,  and then chucked it all as far away from it's home as possible.  The parts were not all together in one spot.<br/>
<br/>
  Any chance that your box was found by the local fauna?  We contacted the box owner and he confirmed that another in the series had been snatched by wee beasts earlier in the season.  He also said that the same thing has happened with plastic tupperware containers.  Guess if I were a beast in the woods, I'd be none too happy about finding a box or pouch of inedible goodies either.<br/>

This is a good opportunity to remind folks not to eat while letterboxing.<br/>
Residual food smells on the hands transmit to the box and they do attract<br/>
the locals, who think a new restaurant has opened in the neighborhood.  Even<br/>
strong non-food smells like baby wipes or other perfumes invites<br/>
four-leggers, and who can blame them for being curious?<br/>

We went back out today to replace the stamp and book that went missing.  Along the way, I actually found the stamp and the hitchiker stamp I left and the ink.  The ink had been used to write "Preston loves Ashlee" on the nearby bridge so I doubt it was found by a squirrel.  We moved the box away from the trail a bit more so hopefully it will only be found by other boxers now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the advice.<br/>
