To Matt the Rat, RE: Chicago Portage<br/>
Have you checked this one lately?  I think it may be MIA.  There's<br/>
been a lot of underbrush removal in the Cook County forest <br/>
preserves, and it looks like your box may have fallen victim.  Please<br/>
let me know if I'm mistaken and I'll keep looking.<br/>

'The sign that really isn't a sign' may not be long for this world. <br/>
Don't know what it looked like when you placed the box, but it looks <br/>
like the local beavers may have found it offensive and are trying to<br/>
remove it.  It looks pretty precarious balancing by one post; my <br/>
thoughts are they may remove it for safety considerations in the<br/>
future.   Otherwise, your box is present and accounted for.  One <br/>
ziplock ripping, but otherwise okay.<br/>
<br/>
To Melinda &amp; Kate, RE: Bees Knees #1<br/>
I think you may need to rehide your box.  The hiding place is pretty<br/>
well rotted out and crumbling.  Your bags are very worn and need <br/>
replacement, but inside the box is fine.<br/>

It was a good day!!!!<br/>
