largest area with regard to letterboxes. we have tons of boxes out <br/>
here. franz solo has placed some nice boxes in the city parks...like <br/>
mt airy and eden parks.  then there's the jedi stuff....a dad and <br/>
son who place boxes and caches in the area.  so you'll have lots to <br/>
choose from!!<br/>
<br/>
let us know when you come in to town. i'm sure that many of us would <br/>
like to meet up with you guys and do some exchanges.<br/>
