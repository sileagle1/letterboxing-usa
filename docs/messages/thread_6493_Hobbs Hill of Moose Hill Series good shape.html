  Just a status report on the Hobbs Hill box in the Moose Hill <br/>
series. We located it today and it is well. <br/>
<br/>
  In what I thought was a nice example of co-existence, the notebook <br/>
in the box has a note and stamp from the Moose Hill Audobon staff <br/>
that they found the box. Then, it appears the staff have used the box <br/>
as a goal/exercise for some of their day camper hikes - a few <br/>
different counselor led groups had properly signed in. <br/>
<br/>
The clues/directions are very good. One note, the clues mention a <br/>
tree bench as a landmark. We think we saw two trees that formerly had <br/>
a bench between, but it has fallen and rotted. It is not a landmark <br/>
you need to get there - just one of those nice "See, we ARE going the <br/>
right way" landmarks. ;-) The unfinished boardwalk menetioned is <br/>
still unfinished, but using caution as advised we did not find it <br/>
difficult to get around the few muddy patches.<br/>
<br/>
  Bug repellent is a must for a summer hiker here. I wish we'd had <br/>
hats too as it would have made me less skitish about the gnats or <br/>
flies that sometimes circled our heads. My favorite part of the hike <br/>
is the pine forest. Tall pines with no undergrowth made for a pretty <br/>
walk. The area where the letterbox is was a good place to stop and <br/>
have a snack as it was not buggy.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails,<br/>
Adelcoll<br/>
