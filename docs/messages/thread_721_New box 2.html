A single box on a steep section of the Narragansset Trail in Ledyard,<br/>
CT, at the top of the pure quartz eruption called Lantern Hill. From<br/>
the corner of CT Rte. 2 and Winchetaug Hill Rd, just south of the<br/>
Mashantucket Pequots Foxwoods Casino, head south on  Winchetaug Hill<br/>
for a short way, and park along the road on your right at the blue<br/>
blazed trail.<br/>
<br/>
Hike up a tote road and bear left with the blue blazes at the<br/>
intersection with the Pachaug Trail. Climb some more before jogging<br/>
right with the blazes to climb along a hillside with spectacular views<br/>
north and west.<br/>
<br/>
At the summit there are many overlooks: leave the trail when it turns<br/>
left away from the edge and cut even sharper left, north, along a spine<br/>
of quartz. Pass a fire ring (the site of both ancient and modern day<br/>
Native American rituals) in a smooth grassy area, and continue briefly<br/>
north onto an<br/>
unmarked trail to an overlook with views to the east. Your reward is<br/>
tucked away from prying eyes in the eastern face of the quartz ledge<br/>
here, just before (south of) a gnarly pine tree. From this spot, a pair<br/>
of communication antennae bear at 108 degrees, the Foxwoods casino is<br/>
seen through the trees at 330, and a ball-shaped water tower is 265<br/>
degrees. You can return the way<br/>
you came, or descend with the trail southward to Winchetaug Hill Rd<br/>
(take a left from there back to your car). Now to try your luck at the<br/>
casino!<br/>
