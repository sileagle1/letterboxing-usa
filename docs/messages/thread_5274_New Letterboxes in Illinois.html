                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm working on a new series of letterboxes to commemorate places along the =<br/>
old Illinois &amp; Michigan <br/>
Canal, which once ran from Chicago to Peru, Illinois. The first two boxes a=<br/>

Starved Rock Buffet Letterbox<br/>
I&amp;M Canal Series<br/>
LaSalle County, nearest town: Utica, Illinois<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Starved Rock gets its name from a battle in the 1760s in which a band of Il=<br/>
liniwek Indians took <br/>
refuge on the top of this rocky battlement. They were surrounded and besieg=<br/>
ed by the Ottawa and <br/>
Potawatomi, who defeated them by starving them to death on the outcrop.<br/>
<br/>
In honor of this terrible battle, every Sunday a sumptuous buffet is held i=<br/>
n the grand Starved Rock <br/>
Lodge, atop the cliff just opposite the rocky knob. The meal is very popula=<br/>
r, especially in summer <br/>
months, and you may be wise to make reservations before your visit.<br/>
<br/>
After stuffing yourself with all the waffles, potatoes, fried chicken, frui=<br/>
t and omelets you can eat, <br/>
and enjoying the majestic fireplace in the lodge hall, and making the pilgr=<br/>
image to the top of Starved <br/>
Rock, you are now ready to find the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the Trail of the Whispering Giant. Listen to Chief Walks With the Wi=<br/>
nd, who will tell you:<br/>
110 down and a little bit up, follow the rabbit back to his home under the =<br/>
tree.<br/>

I used to go to those places when I lived in Chicago in the early 90's.<br/>
The I &amp; M Canal would be great for letterboxing!<br/>

I tried numerous times to find your letterbox at<br/>
Starved Rock.  Either your clues are super hard and<br/>
mine are way to easy.  Or I'm just to new at this, and<br/>
are just having a hard time figuring this one out.  I<br/>
don't know what the 110 down is refering to.  Is it a<br/>
number or numbers to physically look for?  Is it<br/>
steps,<br/>
paces?  There is not much to your clue.  Can you give<br/>
me more information.  I have already had two cases of<br/>
Poison Ivy over the past 3 weeks looking for this box.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to put the clue to my first box again today. <br/>
Hope it works this time.  <br/>
<br/>
I am also going to try the Effigy Tumuli letterbox<br/>
this weekend.  I'll let you know how that one goes. <br/>
Hopefully it will go better than the Starved Rock<br/>
Buffet one.<br/>
<br/>
See you later!<br/>
