                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, we finally met Chuck, Molly, and Chickabirdie on the trail.  We <br/>
happened to be right in our hometown, doing the new Eagle Watch and <br/>
R.K.W. Storm letterboxes. Pretty piece of property near the river.  <br/>
Both boxes were found in great shape.  Clues worked fine. We had Toad <br/>
Dog with us, and of course, they had Molly.  We had a fun time <br/>
exchanging and stamping into HH's that we all had.  AND you couldn't <br/>
ask for better weather than what we had today- GLORIOUS!!! Happy <br/>
Boxing Everyone- Sunshine, Swamp Yankee, and the Toad Dog <br/>
