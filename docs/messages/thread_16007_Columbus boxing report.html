                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday, I had to go to Columbus Ohio for a meeting of professional organizers. It hit me the night before that, "Hey! there are boxes to be found there!" So I stayed up late and got organized with clues and maps and planned my route for after the meeting. I had no idea Columbus had such beautiful areas and unique art sculptures! I probably never would have seen them if it wasn't for this great hobby! Thank you to all the placers. The log books I looked through had a huge variety of stamps in them too, so it looks like lots of people have either tried boxing, are boxers or have passed through the area. Many of the sig stamps I had never seen before, so that was a treat too.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what I found/didn't find.<br/>
Doll's head swamp- found. It's had LOTS of visitors. The bridge is out though. It has washed a little ways down the stream. You can still tell where it was at this point, but I don't know how much longer that will be the case. <br/>
<br/>
** I placed a box on my way in here, I'll post the clues separately.<br/>
<br/>
A Rose Is A Rose- Didn't plan on looking for this one because I couldn't find the park on a map. I had been to the park last year to get Whet-stone, but couldn't recall where the park was located. As I was driving around looking for my next find, I spotted a sign for the park! Glad I did. The roses were pretty much done blooming, but a few flowers are hanging on and it still smelled wonderful. Still has a CD in the box. Lots of mosquitoes!<br/>
<br/>
Antrim's Animals #1- found.  Found in good condition with the Happy Birthday HH in it! I sent an email to DandShoo about it. <br/>
<br/>
Antrim's Animals #2- NOT FOUND. I found what I think is the correct spot and what looked like a shallow depression where the box should have been, but no box :-( The lake was very enjoyable though, lots of people with their dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Thumpa Thumpa- Found. Nice little park. There was a family playing ball right by the 'well', but as I moved toward it, they moved away- thank you to the powers that be!<br/>
<br/>
Griggs Reservoir- Found. I replaced the logbook because it was full and people had been adding pages, so the container was pretty stuffed. I'll get the pages back to Franzsolo (maybe in return for my stamp he's holding hostage?) :-) Cool hiding spot for this one! <br/>
<br/>
Watch House- Found. I almost gave up on this one because I couldn't find the watch house! I asked several people and they pointed in the right direction, but I couldn't find the correct parking spot. It was getting late and I was tired. Finally found it on my way out, so I just parked by the side of the road. Found the box easily once I found the starting point. Very cool sculpture! The box was laying on top of the rocks, so I carefully re-hid it from view.It also was not closed completely when I found it, but it was not wet inside.<br/>
<br/>
Field of Corn- FOUND!! This one had been reported missing by a few folks. I'm guessing that it was taken for awhile and returned, because it was easily visible in it's hiding spot (if you knew where to look). I replaced it where and how I found it. Sad news though, the stamp is broken into 3 pieces. The log is beyond full and papers had really been wedged into the container (possibly how the stamp got broken). I didn't know the placer, so I didn't feel comfortable taking/replacing the log pages. There is a local boxer who is going to try to take care of the box though.<br/>
<br/>
Succotash- NOT FOUND. I checked ALL the trees and the ground and didn't find this one. Maybe it went to the same place as field of corn and it will be back? A local boxer is going to check on it when she checks on the field of corn.<br/>
<br/>
Leather Lips- found in the near darkness. Along with the 'extra' Lion stamp.  It was a little exposed when I found the box, but the outer baggie is so muddy that it blends in :-) I recovered it carefully before I left. This location also has a very cool art piece.<br/>
<br/>
I had really wanted to get to the other side of town for the new series (Symbols of Friendship) as well as visit a few of the other boxes in the area, but darkness and an approaching storm got me motivated to start the 2 hour drive home. They will have to wait till my next trip. Thanks again to all who placed them and those willing to maintain them!<br/>

&gt; Antrim's Animals #1- found.  Found in good condition with the Happy Birthday<br/>
&gt; HH in it! I sent an email to DandShoo about it. <br/>
<br/>
Dear Dog Scouts Troop - We're new at this and have been lurking on the list for<br/>
a few weeks - We're writing to say we're the ones who put Happy Birthday HH in<br/>
Antrim's Animal #1 - found it where we live in Maryland and released it in honor<br/>
of one of our birthdays!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Antrim's Animals #2- NOT FOUND. I found what I think is the correct spot and<br/>
&gt; what looked like a shallow depression where the box should have been, but no<br/>
&gt; box :-( The lake was very enjoyable though, lots of people with their dogs.<br/>
<br/>
As of Sept. 7, Antrim's #2 was there, but the spot was pretty obvious. We tried<br/>
to camouflage it the best we could.<br/>
<br/>
You hit many of the spots we wanted to try, but ran out of time. Here's a report<br/>
on some of the others we got to -<br/>
<br/>
Walk the Dog - Olentangy Parklands - great park to walk in, we're looking<br/>
forward to the whole series when we return.<br/>
<br/>
Buckeye Swamp - the microbox in the Olentangy - OSU (go Bucks!) Wetlands<br/>
Research Center - a wonderful short walk combined with a nice little science lesson<br/>
<br/>
Mirror Lake - OSU campus - we found the box, but alas, this OSU alum was<br/>
dismayed to discover the stamp is MIA and the log book is damp. No placer is<br/>
listed  - is there anyone in Columbus who might take this on as an orphan?<br/>
<br/>
We've also recently placed a series in suburban Maryland - clues are listed for<br/>
Tornado Alley - we've just confirmed that all boxes survived Isabel and our<br/>
recent flood. We've planted two more in a different park and we'll be posting<br/>
the clues soon.<br/>

been visited! I'm so excited. I'll go check on Antrim Animals #2 this <br/>
weekend. It was a little bit too obvious, but I let kids who were <br/>
impatient help choose the spot. We may have rushed it a little. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
