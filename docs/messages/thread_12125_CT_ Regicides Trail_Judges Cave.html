We checked in on it today and it was soaked, so it's home until we can <br/>
repair &amp; return it. Please, please make sure you snap those boxes <br/>
tight, as this one was left partially open.<br/>
<br/>
On a brighter note, there was a red backed salimander and an enourmous <br/>
spider under the rock with the box. Both were relocated nearby, very <br/>
interesting finds.<br/>
