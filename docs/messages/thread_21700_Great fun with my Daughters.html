Being new to letterboxing, I have to share and experience my 3 <br/>
daughters (ages 6, 10 and 13) and I had this past Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
Three days before, on Thursday, we found our first two letterboxes.  <br/>
In fact, we really found three, because the second had a <br/>
hitchhiker.  "Bumble" is the HH we found.<br/>
<br/>
Back to our Sunday adventure.  We went to find "Room with a View", <br/>
planted by Quiteplaces.  This LB had been planted on January 2003.  <br/>
The clues were a set of 5 or 6 pictures and the name of the nearest <br/>
town, a tiny town I might add, in the hills of Tennessee.<br/>
<br/>
When we arrived in the little town, we stopped at a local diner and <br/>
asked if anyone knew where one of the structures in one of her <br/>
picture clues could be found.  The first person told us exactly how <br/>
to drive to the trail head.  From this diner, the box was about 8 <br/>
miles away on the very top of a mountain.<br/>
<br/>
As we neared the trailhead, the picutres began to lead us toward the <br/>
box.  However, the box was supposed to be under a moss covered <br/>
cinderblock.  Yet, there was no cinderblock to be found.  After <br/>
looking for 15 minutes, we walked the short distance to the summit of <br/>
the mountain and enjoyed the views.  To our amazement, right on top <br/>
of the mountain, were two cinderblocks and a large rock!  Someone had <br/>
formed the edges of a fire pit with our cinderblock!!!  <br/>
<br/>
With renewed confidence, we returned to where we thought the hiding <br/>
spot should be and began to clear away all the forest floor cover.  <br/>
After clearing about a 5 foot square, there it was, a perfectly <br/>
prepared letterbox.  We let our 6 year old daughter have the thrill <br/>
of actually picking the box from it's grave, then we moved to an open <br/>
area to explore our find.<br/>
<br/>
To our amazement, we discovered that we were the First Finders of <br/>
this box.  We could not imagine that it had laid there for 2 years <br/>
and 4 months without ever being found.  We exchanged stamps, and made <br/>
our notations then carefully replaced the box to it's forest floor <br/>
location.  Then I hiked back up to the top, retrieved one of the <br/>
cinderblocks from the edge of the fire pit and, hopefully, made the <br/>
site just as Quietplaces had created it 28 months before.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for allowing me to share our experience and our First Find <br/>
box.  BTW, Quietplaces' stamp carving was great for this box.  I hope <br/>
others will soon experience the wonder and awe of Quietplaces "Room <br/>
with a View."  <br/>

wet duckie<br/>
so so cool<br/>
what a reward for first tiem letterboxers!<br/>
I am sure the owner is happy to hear the box is alive and well<br/>
were you able to replant it with the cinderblock??<br/>
we are relatively new to letterboxing. My kiddos have been troopers<br/>
ages 4 and 9,<br/>
 as our first two escapades came up empty handed,<br/>
seems vandals or high water had 'disposed' of those letterboxes.<br/>
instrad we now plant and also are having fun ontroducing others to<br/>
this wonderful hobby.<br/>
have fun<br/>
many blessings too<br/>
