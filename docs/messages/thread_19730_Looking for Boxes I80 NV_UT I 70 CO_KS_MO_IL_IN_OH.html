<br/>
Clan Jiggs is very shortly set to make the trak back to Ontario, <br/>
Canada from here in sunny CA. We're hoping to box (naturally) along <br/>
the way, and are looking for suggestions that will be "drive-bys" or <br/>
close to it.<br/>
<br/>
Our route takes us on I80 through NV and to SLC, UT, before ducking <br/>
south a bit to go through Dinosaur NM and Rocky Mtn NP in CO. Then, <br/>
we're heading south past Denver, and picking up I70 - we're on this <br/>
until we hit just south of Pittsburg, before going to Harrisonburg, <br/>
Pa, Scrantan, PA, the I81 through Syracuse, and accross the border.<br/>
<br/>
Please either post here or send to me offlist at <br/>
jiggs111@earthlink.net AND jiggs11@yahoo.com, as our computer will <br/>
be dismantled in about 2 days.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Pete aka Jiggs<br/>

Have a good trip!!<br/>

Several great ones, especially the Arts in Public Places series.  You have<br/>
