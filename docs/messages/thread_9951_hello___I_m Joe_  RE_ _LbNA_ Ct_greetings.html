I have hiked the Blue Trails of Ct. for many years and since<br/>beganning to letterboxing a little over a year ago, I have had such<br/>pleasure in finding the lovely preserves and small parks that play host<br/>to boxes. We live in a beautiful State and show off our treasures to all<br/>who wish to search out a letterbox.  So many new friends have enriched<br/>my life and brought joy and laughter along as we hike and squeal when we<br/>find our prize.<br/>As Bluebird and I drove home from a day of boxing which ended with a<br/>warm cup of cocoa at The Leader of the Pack's home, we figured we have<br/>walked hundreds of miles together and are pushing a BIG number if we add<br/>our finds, plants, HH and X's  The numbers astound me, but the joy of<br/>hiking and boxing with friends is the very best.<br/>Thanks to all and Happy New Year.<br/>Butterfly<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Your use of Yahoo!
