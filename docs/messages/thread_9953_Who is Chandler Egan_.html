Hello Carol,<br/>
<br/>
Loved your Musical Series and visited the Thank You box just last week<br/>
you certainly do deserve to be thanked for all you have done for this <br/>
pastime. Chandler Egan was one of the top amateur golfers at the turn <br/>
of the century (How could you not know this ?)He is the third of a <br/>
group of golfing Hitchhikers (The Duffer &amp; Bob Macdonald(another 100 <br/>
year old golfer) being the first two.) My wife has said "Enough <br/>
already" and I have moved on to different subject matter. I'm <br/>
planning a couple series focused on the Illustrated Classics series <br/>
of children's books (carved the first in "The Time Machine" last <br/>
night .) I'm glad you liked the stamp. Hoping to see you on the 18th. <br/>
<br/>

Dear Brian, Maybe I didn't know this because I believe large expanses <br/>
of open grass are for cows!  Re: mothermoo , Got Milk Box explains <br/>

&gt; &gt; To be honest I didn't know for sure who he was. I found his <br/>
picture in an old book I got from my dad. And I had to go back to the <br/>
book to get an answer for you.<br/>
