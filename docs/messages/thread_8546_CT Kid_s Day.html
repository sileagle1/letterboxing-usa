                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!  We had such a wonderful time.  <br/>
The weather was just perfect, the boxes were all terrific, and we got <br/>
to meet so many wonderful people.  It's so nice to finally have faces <br/>
to go with all the familiar stamps.  We brought some friends-their <br/>
first day boxing-and they are hooked!  I can't thank Butterfly, <br/>
Bluebird, Alafair, Lobsta Lady, and all(I'm sure I missed somebody) <br/>
for all the hard word that went into this.  We got 49 exhanges and I <br/>
know there were people there we missed!  Also got 25 boxes!!  Some <br/>
were planted, some were bonuses, and some were travellers.  We are <br/>
tantilizingly close to 200 now.  We had a great time finding boxes <br/>
with Dan, Melissa, and Max.  Ruth had a ball!!!  Thank you so much to <br/>
everyone who came and made this event so fantastic.  Hope to see you <br/>
all again soon.<br/>
         Patrick &amp; Amy<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Dan &amp; Melissa- anytime you'd like to go boxing together, just <br/>
drop us a line!  <br/>
