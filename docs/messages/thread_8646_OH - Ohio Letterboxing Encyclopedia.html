                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi gang!<br/>
<br/>
I've been a bit busy with a new help in our Ohio Letterboxing.  <br/>
Contratulations to all!  The web site shows we have 277 listed <br/>
boxes!  <br/>
<br/>
When I was down in Cincinnaiti for the Ohio Gathering, I noted that <br/>
it was getting hard to figure out how to organize a trip to a park.  <br/>
Trying to gather up all the clues to all the boxes even in a single <br/>
park is difficult.  <br/>
<br/>
To that end, I have installed some software on my server which allows <br/>
any of you all to edit pages and create a list of the boxes and any <br/>
other information you think would be useful for our common mission in <br/>
life - placing and finding boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
It is something called a WikiWiki, a group piece of software where <br/>
anyone can edit anything on any page...  Sound interesting, even a <br/>
little frightening?  Welcome to the idea of Wiki.  The site has a lot <br/>
of information about how to use a Wiki, so don't get overwelmed...<br/>
<br/>
It will not work unless the active boxers in Ohio start modifying the <br/>
files.  We need names and URLs for all the boxes listed eventually.  <br/>
As a beginning, why not take a park you know well and start listing <br/>
the boxes you know about.  If you add a box later that is OK... just <br/>
edit it again.  If you have a few minutes, add the url of the box <br/>
too.  Got some more time? Create a page devoted to the box showing <br/>
that you placed it or that you visited it.  No spoilers please.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope you all understand that this resource is not meant to replace <br/>
the utility of the message forum, the LbNA website, or your own <br/>
homepages.  It is just a way to index and make an encyclopedia of <br/>
information which you think others could use.  <br/>
<br/>
Enough is enough... go out there and see what I mean...<br/>
<br/>

The letterboxing gods have spoken . I sat down to ask about boxes in <br/>
Ohio and here is this cool new encyclopedia in the works. Just not <br/>
done in time for my trip .... So all you Ohio letterboxers I am <br/>
passing through Cincinnati on my way to Louisville I would like to <br/>
stop for half an hour or so to stretch weary car riders and find a <br/>
box or two. We will travel I70 , I270, I71, and  I275 from the looks <br/>
of my directions . Suggestions please . I'm juggling driving <br/>
directions maps, clue sheets and  the mouse here there has to be a <br/>
better way.  Also  at the same time I plan to leave boxes in my wake <br/>
so what ever places I go I will leave one or two for you to find . <br/>
Have a whole bagful for the trip.  <br/>
<br/>
Please help   Leader of the Pack  -  Love the upcoming WikiWiki<br/>

&gt; box or two. We will travel I70 , I270, I71, and  I275 from the <br/>

&gt; of my directions . Suggestions please . <br/>
<br/>
Here is a good alternate:<br/>
<br/>
Half way between Columbus and Cincinnati I-71 crosses the Little <br/>
Miami River in a beautiful gorge.  In that gorge is a paved bike <br/>
trail.  With the directions below, you can take a half hour walk and <br/>
find one of the oldest Letterboxes (I think it may be the second <br/>
oldest) and also a box by Franzsolo.  <br/>
<br/>
The letterbox clues are here:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/oh/webeeboxin.htm<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/oh/franzsolo4.htm#Creek<br/>
<br/>
Directions to parking are:<br/>
<br/>
I-71 to exit 36.  Take Middlesboro road two miles, first SW then <br/>
south to state route 350.<br/>
Turn west on 350 for 1 1/2 miles and you will go down a curving road <br/>
to the bike trail.  Right at the bike trail (before the Little Miami <br/>
bridge) is a parking lot you can use.  You need to proceed North on <br/>
the bike trail to the two boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
This is one of the prettiest places I know of in Ohio and is a <br/>
historical letterboxing site. This box was the first one that both <br/>
franzsolo and I found.  It is also a GREAT place to stretch your <br/>
legs.  <br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you decide to take this..  BTW, there is some <br/>
confusion about the number of wooden bridges to count.  You should <br/>
not count the first one which is only a few feet long.  <br/>
