Hi Laura<br/>
<br/>
Sorry you are having a bit of trouble. From what you are posting it <br/>
sounds more like a link problem (from LbNA to AQ) with those clues.<br/>
<br/>
If you are going directly to AQ there should be no access problem as <br/>
even folks who do not register at AQ can access clues. The only clues <br/>
you can not access are those with restrictions (F-count, Premium <br/>
Member, etc.), but those should not be linked to LbNA as that creates <br/>
problems.(Maybe the problem?) <br/>
If you just go to AQ then use the Pulldown function under Home, and <br/>
use the "Contact Us" function you can send a message to Ryan.You do <br/>
not have to register or log in to accomplish this.If you explain your <br/>
problem including the letterbox name then Ryan can look into it.<br/>

I was off hiking around the Big-O when you originally posted your<br/>
question and missed it. Sorry about that!<br/>
<br/>
It didn't even occur to me that people wouldn't allow cookies on their<br/>
browsers. I know there's a setting for that and all, but so many<br/>
websites depend on them just to work, it seems crazy to me that people<br/>
wouldn't allow them. Logging in or registering will always require the<br/>
use of cookies, but I'll have to look into how to make sure that<br/>
"human test" works even if cookies are not enabled. Or at least try to<br/>
detect when people don't have it enabled on their browsers.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure why you would have seen English pounds and such on it,<br/>
though. It's supposed to only display letters. Might be uppercase or<br/>
lowercase, but you can type either and it'll still validate just fine.<br/>
But it shouldn't be using numbers or symbols at all, and having<br/>
cookies turned off shouldn't make a difference in that! Very strange....<br/>
