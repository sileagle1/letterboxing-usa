The price is $3.50 for the first ten.  Additional medallions to the <br/>
same address are $2.50 each.  The prices were changed due to changes <br/>
in postal rates and standards.  Any orders on "back order" will be <br/>
honored at the old price.<br/>

I can also accept Paypal payments that are NOT FUNDED BY A CREDIT <br/>
CARD.<br/>
Paypal should be sent to n0kwa@charter.net<br/>
<br/>
Please note that there is a "zero" between the N and K in the address.<br/>

The deadline for me to receive your order is August 15, 2007.<br/>

I anticipate the medallions will be delivered in the middle of <br/>
September.<br/>
