Cornelia (who has had a history of disappearing and reappearing) has been <br/>
replaced, and anchored down.  The clues are only very slightly modified, as <br/>
is the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
The Weeping Tree got chomped on by a critter and has been replaced (and also <br/>
anchored down).  Clues remain the same; the stamp is a little different.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to retrieve the Weeping Tree logbook, but not Cornelia - maybe <br/>
she'll apparate just once more so we don't lose all those great stamps.<br/>
