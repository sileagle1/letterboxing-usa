We Pasadenans love holidays. We put holiday-themed lights on our <br/>
houses, fly banners outside our houses, and decorate our lawns with <br/>
lighted figures for St. Patrick's Day, July 4th, Easter, Presidents' <br/>
Day, and, most of all to celebrate our favorite holidays: Halloween <br/>
and Christmas. As a true Pasadenan, I love all holidays, but my all-<br/>
time personal favorite is Halloween! By October 7th, the French Hen <br/>
and I have decorated our house with Halloween lights, vintage die-<br/>
cuts, and special effects (black lights, fog machine, strobe light, <br/>
scary music, etc.). On Halloween night, I've been known to don a <br/>
spooky costume and hide in bushes around the neighborhood in order to <br/>
jump out and scare trick-or-treaters. <br/>
<br/>
As I introduce my Halloween letterbox series let me make this <br/>
perfectly clearI'm a believer in a scary Halloween. You won't find <br/>
any smiling ghosts or cutesy benevolent witches in my Halloween <br/>
Seriesit's scary! So if you letterbox with an impressionable, <br/>
possibly nightmare-prone child (or adult . . .), you may want to <br/>
reconsider tackling this series. <br/>

#1 Suicide Bridge<br/>
This beautiful 1,467 foot concrete bridge is the scenic gateway into <br/>
downtown Pasadena, just northeast of downtown Los Angeles. It is also <br/>
well-known to Angelenos as "Suicide Bridge."<br/>
<br/>
Constructed in 1913, the 150 ft. high structure crosses the dry <br/>
Arroyo Seco riverbed. A decades-old story maintains that the body of <br/>
a worker who toppled into a just-poured concrete support could not be <br/>
recovered and remains entombed in the bridge to this day. Supposedly, <br/>
his soul cries out to other desparate beings. While this particular <br/>
story may be unfounded, a number of men did die awful deaths in the <br/>
bridge's construction. This may explain why the bridge became a hot <br/>
spot of sorts during the early part of the last century and the <br/>
Depression when 95 people jumped to their deaths between 1919 and <br/>
1937.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most famous suicides occurred on May 1, 1937, when a <br/>
despondent mother threw her baby girl over the railing and then <br/>
jumped over herself. The mother died, but miraculously, the little <br/>
girl survived the plunge. Her mother had inadvertently tossed her <br/>
into some nearby trees, and she was later recovered from the thick <br/>
branches.<br/>
<br/>
It was reported to me by Doughnut that while looking for this box, <br/>
small children sometimes poke their heads out from the guardrail a <br/>
little too far out into the traffic lanes, and those cars do whizz by <br/>
pretty fast, so be aware. This is a pedestrian sidewalk, though, so <br/>
you are supposed to be safe here. Exit the 210 Freeway at Orange <br/>
Grove Avenue in Pasadena and drive south to the corner of Colorado <br/>
Boulevard and Orange Grove. From this point, travel one block south <br/>
on Orange Grove to Green Street. Turn right on Green Street for one <br/>
block, then right on Grand for one block until you come to a circular <br/>
dead end in a park area. Park your car where you are allowed (check <br/>
the signs), and walk along the paved path west toward the bridge. On <br/>
the bridge, you will see regularly-spaced, inset benches. Count them <br/>
until you get to bench number six on the bridge's south side; here, <br/>
sit and rest, and notice that you are at the one of the bridge's <br/>
highest pointsthe place where someone committing suicide would have <br/>
likely climbed over the railing. In front of you, separating the <br/>
sidewalk from the street, are double metal guardrails mounted on <br/>
evenly-spaced metal posts. Look beneath the lower rail behind the <br/>
left-most post you see in front of you for the letterbox. <br/>
