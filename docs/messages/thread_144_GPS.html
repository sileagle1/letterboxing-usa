I'm feeling so sad discouraged and bummed out.  I went to check on my boxes<br/>
#3 and #4 along Duck Creek.  Four had completely disappeared.  Papers from<br/>
3 led me to the box itself which was missing the book and stamp.  Mooshy<br/>
from being out in the weather for who knows how long, it is a loss.  I'm<br/>
mostly sad for the loss of the two journals that were gaining stamps and<br/>
comments from a few diligent boxers in the area.  The stamps were my carved<br/>
ones, but I did them once, I can do them again...<br/>
<br/>
Deep sigh.  I think I want to take my clues off the web and offer to supply<br/>
them to individuals who contact me directly.  That will definitely be the<br/>
case if #1 and #2 are also gone when I go to check them tomorrow.<br/>

There just may be some clues out there that include a GPS element.  I'm sure many, if not most, won't.  I can see using the GPS concept as an extension of a geography lesson w/ kids.  The budget issue is a valid concern, but I guess even that will resolve itself with time.  And correct me if I'm wrong, but couldn't one find "GPS" coordinates w/o an electronic unit relying only on good topo maps (free on the net) and orienteering skills?  I could be wrong...<br/>

I agree... variety is the spice of life.  I think all the forms of<br/>
letterboxing that are sprouting are welcome.  I don't think that the<br/>
handcut stamps &amp; kid friendly clues will ever go out of vogue.<br/>

<br/>
With that said, most clues give you a starting address or location for the clues. I use my GPSr all the time to get to the starting point, so I wouldn't mind if GPS coordinates leading to the parking area are listed. I would consider that helpful information that wouldn't be required to find the box. I don't know how many hours I have spent planning a trip in order to do the least amount of backtracking possible.<br/>

I don't post the lat/long coordinates on the letterboxing sites but I do on the geocaching site, because it's required.

For those letterboxers with GPS units, don't forget the geocaching.com site - in some areas letterbox hybrids are springing up. And some of those letterboxes are not posted on the letterboxing sites.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My family has hidden 2 boxes that are Geocache Hybrids as well as Letterboxes. I've <br/>
managed to post clues on both letterboxing.org and atlasquest.com and coordinates on <br/>
geocaching.com for one of our boxes. I posted the other box on geocaching.com and I'm <br/>
still trying to work out the clues for the boxing websites. There's a lot of places to post the <br/>
info to catch everyone...  <br/>
<br/>
So yes, I concur with Lone R's advice, check out ALL the sites if you want to find boxes - <br/>
some may not have gotten around to posting them everywhere. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
And to add my 2cents about this... I think geocachers' hybrids are fun hides - a lot with <br/>
homemade stamps - that can be as enjoyable as a traditional letterbox. My family really <br/>
enjoyed being able to make boxes to play both games.<br/>
