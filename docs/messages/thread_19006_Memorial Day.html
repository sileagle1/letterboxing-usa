respectful thanks to all the veterans (alive and deceased)  who have <br/>
sacrificed so much in honor of our country. There are many patriotic <br/>
letterboxes and hitchhikers out there which hopefully provide some <br/>
sense that people are reaching out to you. I am a pacifist but that <br/>
in no way means I have a lack of appreciation for all you have <br/>
offered in the name of liberty. <br/>
  Peace.<br/>
