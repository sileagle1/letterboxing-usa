Box 1 still contains loose pages in place of a log (we unfortuntely <br/>
neglected to bring a replacement). Box 2 contained water, but the <br/>
contents were well protected by a ziplock.<br/>
<br/>
As has been reported in this august forum in the past, box 3 was not <br/>
to be found. Box 4 was also not found by us, but as we were running <br/>
low on time, we may not have looked as carefully as we might.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Jay! I've always meant to get to this spot. It's a splendid <br/>
one.<br/>
