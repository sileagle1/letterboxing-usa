company. We were happy to visit them it is a great location. This was <br/>
the Cowboys first trip to the Cape, he had a blast! A Blue Jay bird <br/>
met an early demise right on top of the box's den. We used a stick to <br/>
clear past the debris of blue feathers to reach our box. It was <br/>
added  camoflage to the blue lid on the box.  I suppose a spring wind <br/>
will carry some away . Thanks for the great hunt. And the wonderful  <br/>
history lesson ,the ship history intrigued the Cowboy who is Seven.   <br/>
Leader of the Pack - in Eggs colored won't they get up soon Ct. <br/>
