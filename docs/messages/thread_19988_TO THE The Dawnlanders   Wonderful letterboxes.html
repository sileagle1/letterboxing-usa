THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for two of the best<br/>
letterboxes that I have ever done. It took a letterbox<br/>
hike to get me to Bolton Notch. I have wanted to hike<br/>
this rail bed for 25 years. I never did. Now I am so<br/>
happy that I did. It was wonderful. Thank you for the<br/>
first finder gifts they were so wonderful. Take care<br/>
and thank you for placing letterboxs.<br/>
Do them if you can.<br/>

Don't say you don't have enough time. You have exactly the same number of hours per day that were given to Helen Keller, Pasteur, Michaelangelo, Mother Teresea, Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Jefferson, and Albert Einstein. <br/>

your compliments!  Only thing better than finding a box, is hearing <br/>
how someone else enjoyed finding a box you placed!  Have to be <br/>
careful now with that new PoisonIvy letterbox rating system! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We only just discovered the rail bed trial, and are look forward to <br/>
seeing what's in the other direction.<br/>
<br/>
Wait till you see the box and log book we have planned for Koyote's <br/>
and our Native American Tribes series!! ;-)<br/>
