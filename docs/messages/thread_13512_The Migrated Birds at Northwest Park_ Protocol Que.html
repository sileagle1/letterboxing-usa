it is a new find, even if the stamps are recycled.<br/>

Remember, there are no official rules.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">FYI   [in CT] Some of The Migrated Birds at Northwest Park did indeed<br/>
begin their journey at Rocky Neck State Park.  However, if you do go<br/>
find them you will notice that there are tweaks here and there,  a cloud<br/>
in the sky,  a twist of a tail, a change in color,  makes most of the<br/>
stamps a wee bit different , they are in very different places with very<br/>
different clues.  Why not count them all , the new and the old. ???  It<br/>
is a great place .Enjoy<br/>
