Because there are so many and I'm not familiar with the area, I'm <br/>
ISO (in search of) some help to narrow down the field a bit.  Also, <br/>
I won't have access to a car and I'm not really up to rough terrain <br/>
or hiking miles at a time anymore (thanks for blowing my cover <br/>
Enders Angel :-) you stinker!<br/>
<br/>
PLUS any local letterboxers want to get together on the weekend? <br/>
I'd love to exchange stamps with some of you!<br/>

Thanks for the off list replies I've gotten so far, everyone.  Seems <br/>
I forgot to do some narrowing down the field, myself! (grin)  SORRY!<br/>
<br/>
I will be staying at the Embassy Suites/Airport.  Hope that helps <br/>
those of you who were frustrated by the lack of information while <br/>
trying to give me an idea of boxes within my reach.  <br/>
<br/>
I'll off list email those who respond (or have already responded).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
