                    <div class="plaintext-content">I zipped up to Purgatory Chasm Friday night to get the Proposal <br/>
series, but only snagged Intimacy and Feelings.  Both boxes are <br/>
showing their age with plastic cracked by exposure to the weather.  <br/>
The Feelings log is very damp.  The other two boxes eluded me as I <br/>
was being chased by a swarm of ravenous mosquitoes and the sun was <br/>
going down.  I don't think they are missing, I just need to go back <br/>
armed with a can of Deep Woods Off.<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday, Rustypuff and I spent a few hours in the Blue Hills before <br/>
attending an Indian pow wow.  We finished off the Time Travelers <br/>
series with Morlock Holes, and then found the Peabody bonus box <br/>
(Rustypuff's 200th!).  We were a little put out (in a good-natured <br/>
way) over the clue for the E=MC2 bonus box, as we did not have the <br/>
required information with us.  Oh well, I guess we'll never be done <br/>
with the Blue Hills.  I see that kingdh22 has placed yet another one <br/>
there.  We'll be back!<br/>
