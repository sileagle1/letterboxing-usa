</p><p>About 15 years ago in Lebanon CT. my dog and I were walking back home through the woods. It was a drizzly windy day. The path took a left turn around a rock and brush. My part black lab dog Brandi was in front. I guess with the noise of the wind, we happened to surprise two coyotes. I heard the yelps and came around the corner to find teh two coyotes were tumbling around with my dog. Brandi being on the ground belly facing up. I grabbed my .38 handgun and shot over their heads (so I wouldn't shoot my own dog) and lunged at them with my knife that I carried which had less than a 3 inch long blade. The noise of the shot and me running at them was enough to scare them off. They did start walking a large circle around us. Quite a distance away but visable because it was late autum and the area had been recently logged. Brandi was brought to the vet and according to him, Brandi was attacked by both coyotes and did the traditional rolling on her back to show submission to them. They were trying to rip open her belly and I saved her in a nick of time. She did receive several stitches in the belly area but was fine. At that time they thought there were no coyotes in CT so the vet thought they were wild dogs.They were coyotes and from the news I hear that they are getting bold. You do have to watch your dog. Brandi was a black lab mix about 80 pounds. When I go in the woods I never think that Molly is there to protect me. She is with me and I am there to protect her......Chuck and Molly in CT</p><p><br/></p><hr size="1"/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>
