letterboxers in the area today. This was our first gathering, and <br/>
while it was a little overwhelming when we first arrived, it wasn't <br/>
long before we joined in the stamping frenzy. Thanks for all of <br/>
the "X"s - we came with 0 and left with 53! I really enjoyed putting <br/>
faces to all of those stamp images we have been running across as <br/>
well as the boxes you have all hidden. <br/>
   My wife and 2 nieces were in "boxing heaven." What a great hobby <br/>
we all are in - great people, great outdoors, great adventures and <br/>
stamps which help make great memories of a terrific day! Hope to see <br/>
you all again soon. I plan to post a review of the day on my website <br/>
tomorrow. Can't wait for the next gathering - did I hear the Cape? A <br/>
lot of boxes there and a wonderful location. Count us in!<br/>
