headed out in search of it.  The seven of us met up at a local <br/>
Mexican eatery then headed out for The Hunt:  <br/>
<br/>
Funhog: The mastermind of the "seven heads are better than one" <br/>
theory.<br/>
<br/>
Windairen (Caitlin) and Dragon Dart (Keegan): Members of the <br/>
Traveling Circus and excellent carvers.  Look for their stampings <br/>
appearing in boxes near YOU!<br/>
<br/>
Pearly Girl (Renee): A newbie, going out for the second time.  Some <br/>
sort of affiliation with Funhog, but I forgot to ask what exactly <br/>
that was.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Amanda from Seattle!:  Infamous and well-known around the country.  <br/>
Still at large.<br/>
<br/>
The Paisley Orca (a.k.a. Amanda from Portland!):  The one voted most <br/>
likely to cause physical harm to Der Mad Stamper for his crypic <br/>
clues.  =)<br/>
<br/>
And myself, of course.  No introduction necessary.  =)<br/>
<br/>
We headed out, under dark and cloudy skies, and those 14 eagle-<br/>
like eyes spotted the elusive box running (naked, no less!) through <br/>
the park.  It ran.  It cried.  It fought back, desparately trying to <br/>
get away, but to no avail.  We successfully caught the box.  After <br/>
signing in and taking group photos of the successful hunt, the box <br/>
was released back into the wild, unhurt, and now waits for a chance <br/>
at vengence against the next unlucky boxer to come its way.<br/>
