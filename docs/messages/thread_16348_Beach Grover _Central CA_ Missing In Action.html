JugglerMouse who wanted him, too. Princess Lea, I offer a fake rock <br/>
for his home if you recarve and want to replant him. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, JugglerMouse and I finished the Nancy Drew Notebook series today <br/>
with great luck. Found the three we have closest to us: Stolen <br/>
Unicorn, Princesses on Parade, and Stinky Cheese Surprise. All were <br/>
in good shape and well hidden. Those three "smool big stones" were <br/>
rather intimidating but we managed. *grin* <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, again, for gracing 101 with such finds. We especially loved <br/>
the unicorn.<br/>

Uh oh - well that robably sets some kind of land speed record for fastest <br/>
disappearance act by a letterbox.  Guess the pincher bugs that live in the driftwood <br/>
didn't do much to protect poor Grover.  I just may recarve him - after I was done the <br/>
first time I realized I had forgotten the beach ball that I meant to put at his feet.  <br/>
Thanks for the offer of the rock for better protection.<br/>
