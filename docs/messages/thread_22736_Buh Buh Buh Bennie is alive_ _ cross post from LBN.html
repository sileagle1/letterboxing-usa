                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am sooooo thrilled as I just received an email from a geocacher<br/>
that he found my missing Buh-Buh-Buh Bennie box. This box went<br/>
missing RIGHT after I hid it and I was so bummed as it was such a<br/>
cool placement and everything. Turns out it just was moved to the<br/>
opposite side of the park....and is in fine shape. The geocacher<br/>
offered to return it to me if needed, but I am just going to go down<br/>
there tomorrow and move it myself. He logged it as a find so he is<br/>
the first finder...but I am hoping that some of you will go check out<br/>
this box once I replace it back in it's original hiding spot.<br/>
<br/>
On that note..I want to thank Cock-O-the-Trail for returning the<br/>
vandalized Gillie Lake box to me. This is a nice place but obviously<br/>
is not right for letterboxes...as now 3 of the 4 I have placed there<br/>
have been trashed/gone missing. One was under the edge of a huge<br/>
boulder in a line of huge boulders that were moved to add to parking.<br/>
One was in a tree that was cut down to make a larger entrance..and<br/>
one was muggled and the book ripped and strewn about. No sign of the<br/>
cool stamp. *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
COT.....I am sorry I didn't get back to you right away but I was<br/>
trying to think of a nice way to thank you for sending me back the<br/>
logged pages that you found. I came up with an appropriate gesture<br/>
and will contact you shortly about it. Thanks so much!<br/>
