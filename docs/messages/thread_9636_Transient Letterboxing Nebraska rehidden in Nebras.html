letterboxer "BGunner01" has been the first to find the letterbox <br/>
known as "Letterboxing Nebraska" since it's been relocated to a park <br/>
outside Omaha, Nebraska.<br/>

&gt; The letterbox known as "Letterboxing Nebraska", created by me, but<br/>
&gt; formerly placed in Oregon by the world-famous Funhog, has finally <br/>
been<br/>
&gt; replaced in Nebraska where other Nebraska letterboxers can view all<br/>
&gt; the wonderful images stamped into the logbook by the Oregon <br/>
letterboxers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In order to find Letterboxing Nebraska, you must first visit (or<br/>
&gt; revisit) the Inferno letterbox.  The clues exist only in the Inferno<br/>
&gt; logbook.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can also report that I checked up on Inferno today, and it is <br/>
doing<br/>
&gt; well.  I tried to find the Troll in Ralston, Nebraska, placed by<br/>
&gt; Erich, but it seems to be gone, as initially reported by Silent <br/>
Doug.<br/>
&gt;  A couple of Omaha area geocachers have also reported finding a <br/>
couple<br/>
&gt; of our letterboxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can check out the Nebraska letterboxing scene, as well as get<br/>
&gt; access to clues to all the (known) Nebraska letterboxes at our web <br/>
site:<br/>
