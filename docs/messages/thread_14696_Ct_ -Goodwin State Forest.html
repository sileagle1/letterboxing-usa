story and clear clues. <br/>
  "The Celestial Series" was such a pleasant walk through forest and <br/>
wetlands.  Flies and mosquitoes were not totally respectful of me, <br/>
despite a liberal application of bug repellent.  "Lucky Star" box was <br/>
wet inside. No damage.  I replaced the log's ziplock bag.   The pen <br/>
could not be uncapped so I left an extra in the box.<br/>
  Bonus at the end of the series was a true treat!  Thanks on behalf <br/>
of all of us to Chuck, Molly and Chickabirdie for restoring and <br/>
adopting this box.<br/>
