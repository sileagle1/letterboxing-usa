<div>In Gloucester, Massachusetts, (Essex 
County):</div>
<div>The Young's Great Rock/Wigwam Point Light 
Letterbox</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Clues:  Easy</div>
<div>Terrain:  Easy</div>
<div>Stamp:  Hand-carved</div>
<div>Placed:  18 August 2002</div>
<div>Special Notes:  Please be respectful of 
no-parking areas and private properties, especially private beach access; 
especially in summertime, private roads are closed to most traffic.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Begin by locating Young's Great Rock, perhaps a 
mile from Wigwam Point with its celebrated lighthouse.</div>
<div>Stand before the Rock, on the flat rock that forms 
a kind of platform, and look North:  you will see the Wigwam Point Light 
framed between the trees.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To your left, a path leads down the hill, 
continuing North.  You will, of course, lose sight of the lighthouse as you 
go downhill.  Keep heading along the path towards the ocean (other paths 
join, going in the same direction). Proceed through the meadow until you see a 
large, whale-shaped, sloping rock on your left.  If you come to 
the stone bench on the left side of the path, you have gone too 
far.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just to the South-west of the afore-mentioned 
whale-shaped rock, you will see a large tree-trunk, cut down and trimmed of all 
its branches.  Adjacent to that trunk at its West end, you will see a 
medium-sized split rock.  Look underneath this rock on its West side:  
you will be rewarded by learning the modern-day name of Young's Great 
Rock.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You can proceed along the path to the beach for a 
closer look at the Wigwam Point Light.  In the off-season, the beach is 
likely to be deserted; in summertime, the beach can be crowded -- non-residents 
may be challenged and asked to leave.</div>
