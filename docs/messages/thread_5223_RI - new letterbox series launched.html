Signs of Life letterboxes<br/>
South Shore Management Area<br/>
South Kingstown, <br/>
Washington County, RI<br/>
placed: May 3, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Signs of Life (4)<br/>
South Shore Management Area<br/>
South Kingstown, RI<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:  Hike &amp; Clues easy (total hike approx. 1 mile)  This is a <br/>
hunting area so mandatory florescent orange required October through <br/>
end of February.  Observe all local &amp; posted regulations.  Take <br/>
proper precautions against disease carrying deer ticks and poison ivy.<br/>
<br/>
Background:	The South Shore Management Area is state-owned <br/>
management area located near the Charlestown-South Kingstown town <br/>
border.  Today's hike takes you to two separate land parcels <br/>
separated by a short 2 mile drive along scenic Matunuck School House <br/>
Rd.  The management area is on the major waterfowl fly way and is <br/>
teeming with wild life. Signs of wild life are everywhere.  During <br/>
the fall &amp; winter months there are distant views of a barrier beach, <br/>
salt pond, Block Island &amp; the Atlantic Ocean.  Many times deer can be <br/>
seen grazing in the corn fields at dusk.  <br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Take Rt-1 to Moonstone Beach Rd. (about 6 miles south of <br/>
Narragansett exits)  Turn south on Moonstone Beach Rd.  The South <br/>
Shore Management Area Field #5 is a dirt road about  mile down on <br/>
the right.  There is no identifying sign however there are DEM <br/>
postings and a small wooden sign with the number 5 on it.  Drive in <br/>
as far as you can &amp; park in the small dirt parking area.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: Walk from your car into the management area along the dirt <br/>
road.  This land was once the Charles T. Cashman dairy farm until the <br/>
1950s when it was briefly a quarry.  Follow the dirt path due west <br/>
past the brown management area signs into the corn fields.  As you <br/>
walk along the path look for signs of life. Deer tracks can be seen <br/>
in the packed dirt.  A good size pack of coyote live in this area.  <br/>
If you look carefully you will find signs of coyote and fox.  You <br/>
will soon pass a large rock pile (left over from the quarry days.)  <br/>
When you reach the south west corner of the corn field, turn north <br/>
still following the edge of the field. At the north west corner of <br/>
the field turn east and there will be a path leaving the field to the <br/>
north.  Take this path &amp; immediately turn right. Follow this path to <br/>
a break in a stone wall.  Look low along the wall on the right side <br/>
of the trail on a diagonal line between two trees to find<br/>
"Wily."  <br/>
Stamp in and re-hide carefully.  <br/>
<br/>
Continue on the trail a short distance. Take the first trail you come <br/>
to on your left (west.)  Follow this trail around to the south until <br/>
it comes back out on the main trail.  Turn right and head back to the <br/>
opening in the fields (will be on your left.)  Walk back through the <br/>
fields  to the wooden signs.  Turn right at the Charles T. Cashman <br/>
sign.  As you walk down the dirt path you can see the large dairy <br/>
barn that was part of the original farm. On your right you will see a <br/>
small frog pond.  Peepers in this pond announce the arrival of spring <br/>
each year.  A red tail hawk lives in the pasture in front of you.  If <br/>
you are lucky you may see him hunting for field mice.  When you reach <br/>
the metal gate at the end of the path look between the two large <br/>
rocks on your left to find "Kermit."   Stamp in. Head back up<br/>
the <br/>
path to the brown signs. Turn right to return to your car. <br/>
<br/>
Leave the management area by turning right on Moonstone Beach Rd.  Go <br/>
 mile to the 4-way stop sign.  Turn right onto Matunuck School<br/>
House <br/>
Rd.  At 1  miles Green Hill Beach Rd comes in on the left and <br/>
Matunuck School House Rd turns sharply to the right.  Immediately <br/>
after this sharp right turn, take a right onto Green Hill Beach Rd. <br/>
Go  mile to South Shore Management Area Field #6 on the right <br/>
(directly opposite Auburn Rd.)  You will have to park on the grass <br/>
along the road.  Do not block the bar way.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the lane down to the entrance to the fields.  When you enter <br/>
the field immediately turn right and walk south along the edge of the <br/>
field.  Walk through the break in the stone wall into the next <br/>
field.  Turn and walk east along the edge of this field.  When you <br/>
reach the tree line at the east end of the field do not continue <br/>
straight ahead but rather take the path 30 ft to your right into the <br/>
woods.  Follow the path east keeping the stone wall and field to your <br/>
left.  At the first grassy area you come to turn right.  Just as you <br/>
reach the end of this small narrow field you will see an opening in <br/>
the stone wall on your left.  "Peter" sits tucked in the wall<br/>
on the <br/>
left approx. 6 ft from the opening behind a 3-trunked tree.<br/>
<br/>
After stamping in go back up the narrow field and turn right to walk <br/>
past the yellow "No Hunting" sign.  Take an immediate left<br/>
into the <br/>
next field.  Turn right and walk along the edge of the field.  When <br/>
you reach the opposite side of the field from where you entered take <br/>
the path on the right through the trees into the next field.  <br/>
Continue walking north along the edge of the field.  When you reach <br/>
the next tree line keep walking straight (north) through the trees <br/>
into the next field.  Walk into the field a short ways.  You will see <br/>
a small pond on your right at the east end of the field.  Head <br/>
towards the pond keeping the tree line to your right, the field to <br/>
your left and the pond in front of you.  When you reach the edge of <br/>
the field by the pond you will see a path that runs along the right <br/>
side of the pond.  Follow this path a short distance until you see a <br/>
stone wall coming in on an angle on the right.  (there is an old <br/>
fence post at the end of this wall.)  You will find "Bambi"<br/>
12 ft in <br/>
low on the left side of the wall.  After stamping in go back down the <br/>
path the way you came and head out through the fields back to your <br/>
car.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoyed seeing these "Signs of Life."<br/>

<br/>
If you go to Daddy's Bread than you definately should stop &amp; do my <br/>
boxes, they are right on the way.  It's really just a short little <br/>
stroll through the fields, but I made the stamps myself (the stamp at <br/>
the second box is the first stamp I ever made.)  I live right around <br/>
the corner from Daddy's.  I love it out here!<br/>
<br/>
take care,<br/>
