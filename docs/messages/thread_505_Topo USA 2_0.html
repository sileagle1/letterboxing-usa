strange lately, but since I hate test messages I might as well take <br/>
this time to recommend a mapping program from Delorme called Topo USA<br/>
2.0.<br/>
<br/>
Its basically a topographic map of the entire US, if you're familiar<br/>
with Street Altas USA, its like that with contours.  At the highest<br/>
zoom level, the scale is about 1:3000, the contours are at 20 feet<br/>
intervals (50 feet in Alaska) -- the same as USGS quads, and some <br/>
major trails through wilderness areas are shown (they claim 300,000 <br/>
miles of trails are on the maps).  It also shows streams, wooded,<br/>
and open features, but not nearly to the degree of detail of an<br/>
orienteering map.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you like to mix maps with your letterboxing, you might want<br/>
to check this program out.  In one sense its like having all the USGS<br/>
quads at your disposal (except that buildings and like features are<br/>
not shown).<br/>
