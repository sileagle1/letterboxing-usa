great putting names with faces and stamps!  There was a LOT of <br/>
creative talent amongst everyone there and just as I had expected, it <br/>
turned out to be such a cool group of people :o)<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to NewBe1 who put so much effort into making the day such <br/>
a success.  I wish I could have stuck around 'til the end, but I had <br/>
a fabulous time while I was there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the people who traveled great distances to be there, <br/>
and thanks to Ladybug who played such a big part is getting this <br/>
great hobby started around here -- it was great meeting you!<br/>
<br/>
Biki, I'm so flattered that you love my watermelon stamp so much and <br/>
I'm glad we got to meet.  You and your dad make a great letterboxing <br/>
team and I eagerly anticipate finding more of those fantastic stamps <br/>
you guys create.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, thanks to the Almighty who provided the PERFECT day for such <br/>
a gathering.  It couldn't have been any more beautiful.  Not only did <br/>
I get to add 15X's, I got to meet 15 new friends :o)  <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to the next gathering,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">WOW! What a great turn out Saturday was. The family and I had a <br/>
blast. I was really happy with the participation, and with meeting <br/>
so many new boxers. It is always great to place a face and a <br/>
personality with a name.<br/>
<br/>
Watch out. I know what you look like now; so don;t hide from me on <br/>
the trail :-) LOL<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though. I would like to thank everyone for participating <br/>
and making the event a complete success.<br/>
<br/>
I am working on the poster right now and hope to have it up in the <br/>
cafe' shop NLT Friday afternoon. So keep your eyes open. I will <br/>
post the link once I am complete with all of the *stuff*.<br/>
<br/>
After we left Pocahonatas the wife/baby and I drove down to around <br/>
Lynchburg, VA and picked up the newest member of our LetterBoxing <br/>
team. A Chesapeake Bay Retriever. He is a little fellow, only 10 <br/>
weeks old.<br/>
<br/>
Well, once again, thank you everyone for helping to pull off a <br/>
wonderful day/event.<br/>
