<br/>
The Postal Service employees hold an annual food drive asking all our<br/>
patrons who can afford it to leave some boxes or cans of food in or next to<br/>
their mailboxes today, Saturday May 10th for pick up by their mail carriers.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow is Mother's Day. Think of the single moms who are just managing to<br/>
get by and need some help from your local food pantries. Think of the<br/>
families, even, who have both parents working but who who are still just<br/>
managing to scrape by. Think of people in this country with no health<br/>
insurance who have to decide whether to pay for the prescriptions that month<br/>
or buy food. The local food pantry helps keep them going.<br/>
<br/>
Even if it's just a can or two or a couple of boxes of mac &amp; cheese mix, if<br/>
you can afford it, please consider donating. The food stays in the community<br/>
because the mail carriers from each community see that the food gets<br/>
delivered to that community's food pantries.<br/>
<br/>
Tons of people donate during the Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons. This is<br/>
the time of year when food pantries are traditionally running low on food<br/>
and will greatly appreciate every single can donated. Please consider<br/>
helping out and donating.<br/>
<br/>
!!! Thanks !!!<br/>
