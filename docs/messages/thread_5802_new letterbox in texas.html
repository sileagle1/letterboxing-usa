Drive to Covert Park at Mt. Bonnell for one of the best views of Austin. <br/>
Park your car and go up the stairs to the top of Mt. Bonnell. Enjoy the <br/>
beautiful vista: Austin's skyline, surrounding hills, and the Colorado <br/>
River. From the top of Mt. Bonnell take the southeast rocky path. Walk <br/>
passed the concrete picnic table and along the fence. When you come to a <br/>
bare rock clearing, you'll see two, white, skinny, four-foot posts. Go to <br/>
the one on the right near the "Notice" sign and the fence. Stand just left <br/>
of the post and at a heading of 180, walk approximately 75-80 rocky paces <br/>
(each footfall counts as a pace). (At around 60 paces, the rocky path <br/>
narrows.) You should now be in a smaller, bare rock clearing. At a heading <br/>
of 270 (or simply look to your right) is a V-split cedar with distinct, <br/>
light gray markings. At its base is a rock covering the tree trunk's <br/>
crevasse in which is buried the Mt. Bonnell Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
When you leave Covert Park, be sure to save time to visit the peacocks at <br/>
Mayfield Park and admire the local artwork and gardens at Laguna Gloria Art <br/>
Museum.<br/>
