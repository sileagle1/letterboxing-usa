  Your kind words are inspiring me... i'll definitely give handcarving <br/>
a try!<br/>

 None of my stamps will rival those by really good <br/>

finding any stamp, there is an extra dollop of fun in finding a box <br/>
containing a stamp someone took the time to carve, even if it's "just" <br/>
a line-drawing sort of thing. The fact that the planter took the time <br/>
to create something for me to find is really cool.......<br/>

&gt; Jump in! The carving's fine. :-)<br/>
