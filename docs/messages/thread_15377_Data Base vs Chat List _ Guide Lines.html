                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not trying to rekindle the flame on this, in fact if you have any comment for me please direct it to me rather than the Chat List. I believe we have a pretty good vehicle for reporting problems with an individual's letterbox in the Chat List. It enables give and take and COMMUNICATION. There are some folks that don't read all of the posts or take it in digest form so contacting the placer directly is a more positive avenue. What's more important? The status of a letterbox or how one feels about egg rolling,the contents of your pack,or the latest nit picking argument at the "Spit and Argue" club. I generally don't read the off topic stuff and I'm not trying to set up guide lines ,I'm just trying to point out that we have something that has worked. The Data Base had some obvious problems and I'm not sure that it was a necessary creation .If the Chat List is used with some fore thought and consideration then it is a more pleasant list to read and reporting on letterboxes is certainly an important pleasantry. That's not to say political correctness should rule, but some level of civility should be used. When reading a post, think about what is written, and maybe your first response isn't the appropriate response. I believe the various responses to Ryan's guide lines can be a good example(again  I'm not trying to rekindle) He posted a link to his web site, he didn't post the guidelines on the Chat List. He asked that you contact him for your input. I wrote him and gave him my input, some pro and some con. Remember Ryan can post what he wants on his site, and you can choose to go there or not. Rehashing his guide lines on the Chat List served very little. His original post was about 3 or 4 lines long with the link ,the responses were far more onerous, wordy and many were lacking the same tact that the guidelines were accused of lacking. I'm not saying that disagreement with the guide lines was wrong , but why not give him your opinion directly ? I would think it would have a better reception and it wouldn't have the same negative effect on OUR Chat List. Don foxsecurity@earthlink.net<br/>
