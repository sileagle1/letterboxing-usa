I am finishing up (finally) my Master's Thesis at Colorado State. For <br/>
the final piece of research I have a survey that I would like to have <br/>
at least 250 respondents (this means you guys) answer the questions <br/>
for. In exchange for taking time out of your day to help me with my <br/>
research I will send you a hand-carved virtual image. Please know that <br/>
this survey is confidential and only numbers will be associated to the <br/>
answers given. I will also be cross <br/>
