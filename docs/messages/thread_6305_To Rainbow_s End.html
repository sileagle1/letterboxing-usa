Boy, if I didn't run three miles a day I don't think I would have made it up all those hills and through all that sand!  Thank GOD there was a lake to dip into at the end of the trails!  Beautiful sites, though.  (With the exception of the fat man nude sunbathing on the beach at Warren Dunes today -- NOT pretty!)<br/>
<br/>
I planted a box, "Legend of Ruffled Feather", at Saugatuck Dunes, not far from your "Birthday" box.  I'm not done writing the story/clues yet but will post them ASAP.  What a truly stunning trail the North Trail there is!  I couldn't help envisioning Native Americans traipsing through the forest :)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, are you the Rainbow's End who has a home or cottage on A-2 (Blue Star Hwy.) just north of Van Buren State Park?  I passed a sign hanging at the end of the driveway of one such house yesterday and immediately thought of you.  If it's not it's quite a coincidence!  At any rate, thanks for the boxes -- and the cardiovascular workout!<br/>
