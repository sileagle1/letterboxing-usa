Welcome Geogeorgia,<br/>
<br/>
There is a "getting started page" at www.letterboxing.org that will <br/>
answer all your questions and the ones you didn't know to ask.  In <br/>
the links section, to the left of this page, is a link to a newbie <br/>
talk list where senior boxers help the freshmen boxers.  There's <br/>
also hundreds of links and files for your rainy day reading <br/>
pleasures.  <br/>
Taking a wild guess by your trail name, your in Georgia.  If so I'll <br/>
welcome you to come on over to the Southeast list and sit a spell<br/>

Then just go out and box, and you will be hooked.<br/>

been reeding a lot of stuff. The senior boxer and freshmen boxer <br/>
thing is not clear. Do you need to complete a school course, and <br/>
where can I find the newbie talk list? My name is Georgia and I <br/>

Hi Geogeorgia,<br/>
If you go to WWW.letterboxing.org you will find a FAQS page that <br/>
will help you over the hurdles. If you go to <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers you will find a very <br/>
receptive group that will help you with any questions you may have. <br/>
What Boxdn said about the senior and freshmen were figures of <br/>
speech, and you will not need any school course. What he meant was <br/>
the senior letterboxers (old timers) will help out the new folks<br/>
(you) at that list.<br/>
Don<br/>

Thanks Don, for the translation.  <br/>
Georgia sorry about the schooling scare.;-)  I posted this link on <br/>
my original post<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-southeast/<br/>
It is where all the boxers in the Southeast US go to keep up with <br/>
local happenings; most of whom live in the Atlanta,GA area.  <br/>

Hi New Folks,<br/>
You have had several links posted from other letterboxers, but here <br/>
is one designed with the new letterboxer in mind. There is no dumb <br/>
question and no animus. Those with "Tude" should go somewhere else.<br/>

I would also like to mention that we have a gathering coming up in Tomball<br/>
October 21st, and another informal one at Memorial Park on October 22nd.<br/>
Details on those events are:<br/>

http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=173<br/>
<br/>
There will be tons of boxes at that time, and lots of boxers on hand.<br/>
Dewberry and TeamKing are hosting it and Mother of Five has been<br/>
instrumental in helping them pull it all together.  All three of these women<br/>
are outstanding Texas letterboxers!<br/>

Welcome to the game!<br/>
