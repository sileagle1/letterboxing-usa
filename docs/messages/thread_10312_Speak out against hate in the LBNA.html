<br/>I have a bumper sticker that says, "Speak your mind, even if your voice shakes."
<br/>I have another that says, "Teach peace"
<br/>And another..."Celebrate Diversity,"
<br/>
<br/>It IS so very important to speak up for what we believe in, but it should be forever tempered by the Golden Rule (Treat others as you would like to be treated) and perspective (if I got hit by a bus tomorrow, would this really matter?)
