Location Description:<br/>
<br/>
  This letterbox is located on the Clapp, Scorgie, Tufts, and Smith<br/>
  Conservation Area which occupies 117 acres from four parcels of land<br/>
  that were acquired by the Harvard Conservation Commission.  The<br/>
  clues take you on a loop through the wooded trails in this area.<br/>
  Note, there are no facilities at this conservation area, please<br/>
  leave it cleaner than you find it.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
To find Clapp, Scorgie, Tufts, Smith conservation area:<br/>
<br/>
  Take Interstate 495 to Rt. 2 West, exit 29B. <br/>
<br/>
  Head west on Rt. 2 to Harvard Exit 38A, take exit and follow route<br/>
  110 West.<br/>
<br/>
  At the blinking red light in the center of the town of Harvard<br/>
  follow Rt. 110 West by turning right onto Still River Road.<br/>
<br/>
  Travel nine tenths of a mile to Turner Rd. This is the public access<br/>
  road to this Harvard Conservation Land.  There are two trail heads<br/>
  along this road, go to the second trail head which is two tenths of<br/>
  a mile along Turner Rd from Rt. 110.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
  Blue blazes and a Harvard Conservation Land sign mark the trail<br/>
  head.<br/>
<br/>
  Take the high path bearing 240 degrees, cross through stone wall,<br/>
  and twixt large boulders.<br/>
<br/>
  Bear 180 degrees when blue meets with yellow (a red arrow marks this<br/>
  junction).<br/>
<br/>
  Avoiding the private property trail which enters on the left,<br/>
  continue on yellow.  This trail joins up with a dirt road.<br/>
<br/>
  Bear 290 degrees along road until you see fallen patriots on the<br/>
  right.  Bear 240 degrees following yellow blazes until bridges<br/>
  present options.<br/>
<br/>
  Make the right choice here.  At the next trail intersection don't<br/>
  make the right choice.  Be on the lookout for a blue arrow on<br/>
  yellow. A small triangular rock in the middle of this side trail<br/>
  points the way.<br/>
<br/>
  At the stone wall, take 45 steps along the trail to a small twin<br/>
  tree surrounded by rocks.  Orient yourself on the trail side of<br/>
  these trees by placing your hips against both trunks.  Take 12 steps<br/>
  straight ahead onto a flatish rock.<br/>
<br/>
  You now overlook your prize hidden near.<br/>
<br/>
Return route:<br/>
<br/>
  Return back to the blue arrow and turn right onto the yellow trail.<br/>
  Continue on the yellow trail.  This will connect back up with<br/>
  familiar ground.  Follow the yellow blazes along and past the dirt<br/>
  road.  Shortly after passing through a stone wall and by the private<br/>
  path (on your right), take the trail to the right and follow the<br/>
  blue blazes over a short bridge along the well-rooted path (caution:<br/>
  may be wet).  This will take you back to the trail head and your<br/>
  car.<br/>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
<br/>
  Bearings are magnetic north.<br/>
