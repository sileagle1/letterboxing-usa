I would love to get letterboxing as one of our projects that we can <br/>
work on.<br/>
<br/>
A while  back Cock a Doodle Moo club mentioned in one of their post <br/>
that they sent information to a friend in Idaho to get it started in <br/>
that state.  <br/>
<br/>
Is anyone in 4-H that already has this project up and running?<br/>
<br/>
Hope to hear from anyone Soon<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are involved in 4-H, and I too think it could make a great project but haven't gotten to work on it yet.  One could always choose "self-determined" as a project and make up your own thing, but it would be nice to have a framework from someone who has already done that. There is an orienteering project here in PA, or at least we have had leaders for it, so I could envision it being combined with that in some way.  - -lunaryakketyact<br/>

children to our trail center in Manorville , LI.  We (the Long Island Greenbelt <br/>
Conference) are working on it too.  So any ideas are helpfull to us.  We <br/>
thought maybe a seris or workshops such as compass reading,  stamp making , reading <br/>
and/or writing clues, and then putting together a letterbox. Of course. the <br/>
aim will be to find some letterboxes in the field.<br/>
