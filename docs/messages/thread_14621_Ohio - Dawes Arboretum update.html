                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, Willowanderers, for bringing us to the lovely arboretum.  <br/>
We loved the Japanese Stewartia and the lovely carving. It is such a <br/>
terrific place all around.  It seems to us that box #1 is among the <br/>
missing, and since the baggy for the rare trees actually had <br/>
creatures swimming in it, so we have removed the baggy for you and <br/>
there was nothing else there but the stamp and container.  I wish we <br/>
could have done a little more clean up (it really needs some help), <br/>
but at least we dried it out a little.  Thanks -<br/>
rtrw and friends<br/>
