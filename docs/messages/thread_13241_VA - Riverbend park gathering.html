for the Virginia gathering at Riverbend Park.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for the food and drinks- the curry salad was<br/>
wonderful...loved the (pound?) cake, cookies, coleslaw, hmmm... guess<br/>
I ate more than I thought I did :-)<br/>
<br/>
A quick total shows 26 exchanges, 4 hitchhikers and one bona fide box<br/>
stamped for the day.  Glad to meet all of you, especially to finally<br/>
put a face to the stamps I see repeating at all the boxes I visit.<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to Mary and Firefly for carving the event stamps.  Who<br/>
did the other event stamp?<br/>
<br/>
Scarab: nice letterboxing book!  Where are you going to place it?<br/>
<br/>
To anyone who went after the treasure map and letterboxing final exam,<br/>
I hope the clues wern't too hard.  I'll post these boxes to the web<br/>
site soon if you missed them.<br/>

Yes, thanks so much for your really fantastic work - my son loved going after <br/>
and we were very impressed with the map (which we had to take home to <br/>
decipher).  <br/>
This turned out to be a much better event than expected, with fear of rain <br/>
and flooding.  The sun was out, the air was warm and reasonably dry and a <br/>
surprisingly large number of wonderful people, yourself included, showed up!<br/>
I am very happy I got to meet so many great 'boxers and how about we all do <br/>
this every May, in a different park each time?  I promise to do a better job <br/>
setting it up next year!<br/>
