<div><span class="720461818-09022003">Molly has had no 
training in finding things.She has found several boxes. I think it is because 
she understands that this is something I look for. Many other times though, she 
tries to poke around the box after I find it. Molly will also get interested in 
anything I seem to be doing. When I chop wood, she will get a splinter piece and 
chew on it. I often climb up on rocks to look around in the woods. She does the 
same thing. As witnessed at Butterflys birthday box in Chaplin. It's like, to 
her, this is something we do. She often finds places or things that are out of 
place or something I have shown an interest in, in the past, such as old 
foundations, other trails, etc. It would be hard to train her to find boxes. The 
woods have so many interesting things and smells for a dog. To get them to just 
finding boxes might be tough. I find that getting used to how she acts and what 
she does, you get to understand the dogs body language. It becomes much easier 
to tell what is going on with the dog once you learn this. That is learned by 
going out a lot with the dog and paying attention to her. You will be surprised 
what you learn......Chuck and Molly</span></div></body></html>
