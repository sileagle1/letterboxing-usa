about it) might want to see the exhibit of photographs by mountaineer<br/>
Vittoria Sella, which just opened at the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum<br/>
in South Hadley, MA. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries Sella<br/>
photographed the Alps and the Caucasus, Mount Saint Elias in Akaska, the<br/>
Karakorum, and other places. I saw the exhibit yesterday and heard a talk<br/>
by Sella's grandson.  The photographs are truly amazing, especially when<br/>
you consider he was carrying heavy glass plates and a 25-pound camera!<br/>
<br/>
You can read about the show online here:<br/>

<br/>
It continues through March 10.<br/>
