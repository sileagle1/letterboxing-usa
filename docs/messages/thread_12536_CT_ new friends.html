stamp exchange, and plant two new boxes all while having Steve to chat <br/>
with and help carry rocks.  Why oh why are there never rocks in the <br/>
woods when you need them?  Thanks for meeting me , Steve. Next time hope <br/>
Heidi can join us .<br/>
These two new boxes are on the pink trail in the Walden Nature preserve <br/>
in Salem, and as Steve said, look for the way they will be listed.  The <br/>
plan is to print off a bunch of clues and when you stamp into the Event <br/>
Stamp that Steve and Heidi  will be carrying during the March for Cancer <br/>
Research , they will give you a copy of the clues. The clues will not be <br/>
posted on the list until after the March. .  Tricky , like the Pink <br/>
Trail ;-)<br/>
