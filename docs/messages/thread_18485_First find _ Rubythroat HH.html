                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for kind responses to my questions about eventually switching stamps.  OK, we'll go for it and grow with it.  My artistic daughter is already thinking up fine ideas!  SO, well, we couldn't wait til we heard something (hadn't gotten today's messages yet), and were out earlier prowling for Giant Peach.  We found it, our very first find ( ! ) and were excited to find an extra treat-- Rubythroat HH had flown in too!  Pretty little stamp!  So, it will be flying elsewhere soon.  No idea where...  On sizes, Giant Peach is around 2 1/2" per side-- is that about the upper range we would consider carving?  ---Thanks, &amp; lookout, Pennsylvania. --- lunaryakketyact  <br/>
