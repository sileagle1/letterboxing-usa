time on my way out to the east coast to do a few letterboxes and <br/>
found all but one box that I looked for.  See message #16365 from <br/>
9/15/02 for notes on my unsuccessful search for the April Fool's Box.<br/>
<br/>
MI Boxes found and condition:<br/>
<br/>
Snowflake -- looked like the outer bag had been used to hold the log <br/>
book (not sure what happened to the smaller bag). I put the log book <br/>
in a new small bag and used the larger one for the entire box as the <br/>
box cover has a hole in it at one corner and would probably have <br/>
taken on water over the winter.<br/>
Jabberwocky<br/>
Fox in a Box<br/>
Crosswinds Marsh Series #1 and #2<br/>
<br/>
(Note to self...  Ruthann has very small paces)<br/>
<br/>
Great locations, clues and stamps!  A wonderful start to my boxing <br/>
blitz!<br/>
