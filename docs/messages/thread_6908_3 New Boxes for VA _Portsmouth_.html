Walk next to the road you came into the park on. Follow the fence on <br/>
the east side until you come to a lightpole. If you look straight at <br/>
the lightpole, you should be able to see a playground on both sides <br/>
of it. Turn around and look away from the lightpole. <br/>
<br/>
Go 60 degrees until you come to a large monument. If you walk around <br/>
it, you'll see many names of places and names. From the Sharpsburg <br/>
side, go 100 degrees to the fence. <br/>
<br/>
Go around the fence, and follow the path near the river. Start <br/>
counting fence posts. Between the 5th and 6th posts, the Warrior <br/>
shall be between a rock and a hard place, covered by dark cardboard. <br/>
Stamp in, and rehide very carefully.<br/>

Thanks.<br/>

&gt; The Ultimate Syndicate is proud to be the first to put out boxes in P-<br/>
&gt; town... Yay, what an honor (note: lots of sarcasm being used here).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Starting point: Portsmouth's City Park in Portsmouth, Virginia<br/>
&gt; Info: great place to take anyone. Nine hole golf course, large play<br/>
&gt; area for the kids, croquet grounds for grandma, water for your boats,<br/>
&gt; and lots of places to sit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Park in the first parking lot nearest to the picnic shelters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; "The Ultimate Warrior"--named for a face-painted pro-wrestler<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Walk next to the road you came into the park on. Follow the fence on<br/>
&gt; the east side until you come to a lightpole. If you look straight at<br/>
&gt; the lightpole, you should be able to see a playground on both sides<br/>
&gt; of it. Turn around and look away from the lightpole.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Go 60 degrees until you come to a large monument. If you walk around<br/>
&gt; it, you'll see many names of places and names. From the Sharpsburg<br/>
&gt; side, go 100 degrees to the fence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Go around the fence, and follow the path near the river. Start<br/>
&gt; counting fence posts. Between the 5th and 6th posts, the Warrior<br/>
&gt; shall be between a rock and a hard place, covered by dark cardboard.<br/>
&gt; Stamp in, and rehide very carefully.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; "Stroke of Luck"--the nine hole golf course on the west side of the<br/>
&gt; road is lots of fun for beginners. Hole #6, "Waterloo", is a great<br/>
&gt; challenge for those who like water.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From the Warrior, go back to higher ground, but proceed along the<br/>
&gt; edge with the water on your left. Moving away from the fence, you'll<br/>
&gt; walk along the Western Branch of the Elizabeth River when you notice<br/>
&gt; a group of five pines--two large adults, and three babies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From the first adult, go straight to the baby in the middle, stopping<br/>
&gt; just short of its branches. Looking across the water to your left,<br/>
&gt; there's a nice white house right on the water. Imagine a line drawing<br/>
&gt; the angle between the tree to the house. Use that same angle on the<br/>
&gt; right side of the baby to a large bush. The bush is between you and<br/>
&gt; the water. At the base of this bush covered in branches and leaves is<br/>
&gt; a "Stroke of Luck". Stamp in, and please rehide carefully.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; "Wedding Bells"--made by a husband for his wife in honor of their<br/>
&gt; marriage<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From "Stroke", if you look to your right, you will see the Friendship<br/>
&gt; Gardens. Take the paved path into the Gardens. Cross over the bridge,<br/>
&gt; and walk straight towards the water fountain. The base of the<br/>
&gt; fountain is a cement square. From the square's corner that points<br/>
&gt; right, take a stroll in that direction. Make sure you walk straight<br/>
&gt; otherwise you may lose your way. You know you are on the right path<br/>
&gt; if you see concrete edging to your left. After a few minutes you'll<br/>
&gt; see a marker on your right. There will be pines to your left and<br/>
&gt; right, and eventually a large pine will be directly in front of you.<br/>
&gt; To your left, you will notice a sandy path leading to a small<br/>
&gt; enclosure in the Gardens.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Stand in the spot where you believe the minister would be. Make sure<br/>
&gt; you consider in which direction the minister would face. If you turn<br/>
&gt; your head to your right, you will see a holly bush. Wedged in the<br/>
&gt; branches near the base of this holly bush are our "Wedding Bells".<br/>
&gt; Please make sure you rehide very carefully after you stamp in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have a great time!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Ultimate Syndicate<br/>
