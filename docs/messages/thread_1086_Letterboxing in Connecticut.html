                    <div class="plaintext-content">I hadn't gotten out any this summer to hunt for boxes, but arranged <br/>
for two days off (from family) and went down to Arcadia in Exeter RI <br/>
on Friday. Had a great day looking for Jay Drew's boxes, and was met <br/>
by Jay at the end with a much appreciated Ginseng Iced Tea!<br/>
<br/>
Jay and Margaret put me up for the night again. They are the nicest <br/>
people, in addition to being great letterboxers! Saturday I got off <br/>
to Hartman Park in Lyme CT, which was also a splendid day. I met two <br/>
other letterboxers there! Evelyn and Debbie were just starting out, <br/>
and we exchanged stamps. They are heading up to Tuckerman's Ravine <br/>
next week, and were disappointed that I'd already gotten Bob &amp; Judy's <br/>
box there last week. Jay had already explained that getting 'Firsts' <br/>
in CT is a big deal; nobody else cares at all, I'm sure ;-)  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I told them that I had not gotten the box because the Ravine <br/>
was closed for trail maintenance. (If I were not a hiker first and a <br/>
letterboxer second I would have snuck in!) But the trail work will be <br/>
over a few days before they go, I said, so they will be able to get <br/>
the box. Big smiles! Good luck, ladies.<br/>
<br/>
I would say our hobby is taking off when you can go letterboxing and <br/>
meet other letterboxers in the same place!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Tom, for your gracious words! What Tom doesn't mention, <br/>
however, is what a SERIOUS hiker he is. When I saw him striding up <br/>
the Tippicansett Trail, I couldn't tell he had just covered over 26 <br/>
miles of a cluesheet that warns:<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Feathers in Your Cap is a long one, a chain of 4 letterboxes <br/>
linked by strenuous, challenging terrain. Experienced hikers and <br/>
mountain bikers will be in hardcore heaven, but beginners will think <br/>
they're on a death march. If brought along, most kids under 12 or 13 <br/>
will permanently withdraw into a PlayStation universe and never go <br/>
outdoors again.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
A note at Tom's last letterbox of the day from Sarah, herself a <br/>
professional hiker, says "my feet are tired and I want a snack." Mr <br/>
Cooch, though, even after leaving Vermont at 2am, was smiling, <br/>
positive, and had lots of leg left. You're my hero, Tom!<br/>
