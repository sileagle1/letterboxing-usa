are amazing.  Thanks also to the other "placers" for some wonderful <br/>
additions to my collection!<br/>
<br/>
The following boxes are all in great shape:<br/>
CT State Stamp<br/>
BenE<br/>
Glass Factory<br/>
Mousing in Laidlaw Park<br/>
Red Bird and Skungamaug River<br/>
Presidential Animals (all 3)<br/>
Mary Lemist Titcomb<br/>
Uncle Sam's Nephew<br/>
The Great Charter Oak's Great-Grandson<br/>
Pumped Up<br/>
A Trip Through Town<br/>
The May Basket<br/>
<br/>
Also, all the stamps for Women of the Revolutionary War were in great <br/>
shape (and very well done!), however, poor Deborah Samson's logbook <br/>
is a sponge and ought to be replaced before all the ink inside runs <br/>
together. <br/>
<br/>
It could be me, but I couldn't find:<br/>
Hazel of Watership Downs (but the other 2 were fine)<br/>
Lake Wangumbaug<br/>
Stars and Stripes Forever<br/>
<br/>
If anybody knows about these 3 boxes and want to toss me a clue, I'd <br/>
be good with that!  Of course, it'll be a while before I'm back to <br/>
Coventry.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks everybody!<br/>

Hazel of Watership Downs was there when I found it in March (?).  If you were <br/>

No, actually, I'm not sure I was in the grove at all for Stars and <br/>
Stripes.  I walked down to the tree line at 180*, but didn't see <br/>
a "Holy Grove", didn't even see a holly grove, which I thought <br/>
*could* be the case.  I felt a little weird traipsing around the park <br/>
becuause it was closed for the season.  Next time, I'll focus on the <br/>
GROVE part and ditch the compass!<br/>
<br/>
As for Hazel, I WAS in the wall!  I know the clue said "at your <br/>
feet", but didn't see anything down there.  I wasn't even sure I was <br/>
on the right part of the wall.  Hmmm... and now seeing how there is a <br/>
BRAND NEW BOX in Coventry... I may have to plan a return trip sooner <br/>
than I thought.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help!<br/>
