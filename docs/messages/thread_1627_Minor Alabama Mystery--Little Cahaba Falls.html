Little Cahaba Falls Letterbox, Bibb County, Alabama<br/>
<br/>
Originally out in the fertile fields of the Old South a family whose <br/>
patriarch Ebenezer Leeth settled on a Bibb County farm.  The Leeth's grew <br/>
tobacco and cotton and the staples of a southern farm.  While they didn't <br/>
live like "Gone with the Wind," they did have a commercial planting and <br/>
like many southerners owned a few slaves.  Ebenezer had been an officer <br/>
with Andrew Jackson during the War of 1812 and bought the place on which he <br/>
settled in 1829.   During the War for Southern Independence, hostile forces <br/>
invaded Alabama and camped at a ford in Bibb County on the Little Cahaba <br/>
River south of Birmingham.  They came through the countryside on their way <br/>
to destroy the Tannehill Iron Works that supplied cannon balls to the light <br/>
artillery in Lee's Army.  Soldiers, made up of good and bad acorns alike <br/>
but with great hostility toward those who might thwart their purpose, <br/>
singled out one of the planter's daughters as someone they'd like to invite <br/>
by force to a little private party.  One of the ogling soldiers, too <br/>
forward for his good, pushed his invitation beyond propriety and one of the <br/>
family slaves--young Julius-- struck him with a shovel to protect his <br/>
master's daughter.  Naturally, the commander of the raiding party couldn't <br/>
tolerate one of his troop being killed--for whatever cause without meting <br/>
out justice on the accused.  With Master Leeth's help Julius fled to a <br/>
limestone cave on the property that had hidden access to the river and hid <br/>
for a week or more until the troops exhausted their search and pushed on <br/>
the iron works.<br/>
<br/>
By the early 20th century the land changed hands when the McGuire family <br/>
bought it and left their name on the area.  Then in 1931 it changed hands <br/>
again. Yet the story about Julius taking on the rabble who roamed the <br/>
country side in those troubled years stayed with it.  Old Man Williams took <br/>
the place and continued to farm it.  Later ole' Charlie got the idea that <br/>
he could rent float tubes and float people along the river.  He set himself <br/>
up a recreational tourism little business and some camp grounds to <br/>
supplement his truck farm.  Along the river, tubers float across several <br/>
small falls on their way to the Cahaba River.  Be sure and pick up your <br/>
bottom!  Don't float as far as Bulldog Bend though--ole'  Charles wouldn't <br/>
want to lose his tube.  The campground at the falls looks across the river <br/>
to this letterbox.  Take your tube out under the small sycamore tree just <br/>
beneath the last fall.  It's about 218 degrees to the far edge of the falls <br/>
there and 144 to the near.  The box is about 20 degrees away up the <br/>
hill.  Were you standing at the box you'd site 280 degrees to the edge of <br/>
the falls.  The box is planted near the top of the limestone scarp beneath <br/>
a large cedar root that weaves itself along the edge of the rock.  There's <br/>
a small cedar 128 degrees away.<br/>
