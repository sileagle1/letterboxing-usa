Visit Mansfield Hollow Park, the picnic area is off Bassetts Bridge <br/>
road in Mansfield Center. Not at the dam itself and not the boat <br/>
launch. There is a little parking lot near the road. Walking into the <br/>
park to find a perfect fishing spot we headed up the paved road past <br/>
the ball fields. At the junction we turned right and walked by an old <br/>
fashioned water pump. Then on past latrines and other park <br/>
amenities.  Staight ahead was a park gate they scooted around the end <br/>
carrying all the fishing gear and a nice picnic lunch. Down an <br/>
incline we went ,there were two huge logs to the right and a lonesome <br/>
picnic table.  We went a little to the left, there were several <br/>
choices we took the main  path which was in the middle. We dropped <br/>
down a gravel and sand incline ( actually the cowboy dumped his bike <br/>
here  and was proud to get up and go on ). We went just a bit more <br/>
straight and could see the blue waters of the lake glistening in the <br/>
distance. As we started down the trail toward the water we saw a tree <br/>
broken off at about 4 feet and the tall spire now resting pointing to <br/>
the water. Here we stopped to scratch by rock and dirt to see if we <br/>
could find some worms. The early bird catches the worms I told him <br/>
and we were rewaded. It was a wonderful spot to stop although we were <br/>
quick to take care of things as this is a busy park and others could <br/>
come by at any moment.  Opening Day was a great fishing adventure. We <br/>
went back the way we came but could have walked on and to the waters <br/>
edge and around ( Rt. )  to the boat launch then up the road to the  <br/>
car. <br/>
