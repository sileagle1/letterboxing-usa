following boxes that The Yachtsman and I have successfully found in RI<br/>
over the last few weeks.  While traveling to and from these boxes, we<br/>
placed the HH "Happy Camper" somewhere in RI.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Castle Hill (Fast Passage Series)<br/>
Sachuest Pt (Purgatory Point Series)<br/>
Beavertail<br/>
Palindromic Harmony<br/>
<br/>
All were in good shape, although some boxes were wet or damp inside. <br/>
We replaced a few plastic bags here and there.  Beavertail was pretty<br/>
wet, and the log book was "curled" from being even wetter in the past.<br/>
<br/>
Palindromic Harmony was in excellent shape, although not many folks<br/>
have yet unlocked its clues.  A lot of fun -- thanks to whoever placed it!<br/>
