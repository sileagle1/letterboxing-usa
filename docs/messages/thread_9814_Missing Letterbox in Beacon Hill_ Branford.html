                    <div class="plaintext-content">My son and I were out letterboxing at Beacon Hill in Branford, CT <br/>
yesterday.  We found the Eastern Trail Trolley Letterbox and went to <br/>
look for the second.  We found the site where the letterbox should <br/>
be, the clues are very good.  the last item to find the letterbox <br/>
was a flat stone in a particular compass direction.  We found the <br/>
flat stone in another direction and there was no letterbox there.  <br/>
We searched the area suspecting that maybe somebody had vandalized <br/>
the box, but we had no luck.  It was getting dark, so we headed home.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Has anybody been to the box lately, or has CrusinRay checked it out <br/>
lately to confirm that it is still there?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank You,<br/>
