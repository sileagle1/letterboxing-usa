state or province FIRST in the subject line (not at the end; that doesn't <br/>
always help), so we could decide BEFORE opening every single post whether <br/>
it's something we want and/or need to read.<br/>
<br/>
A little whining to explain why I have made this request several times:<br/>
<br/>
I cannot afford a fast new computer/new software or a DSL line.  I live in a <br/>
remote area with "slow telephone lines" :)...  I've got a 56k modem and I <br/>
think the best they can do here is 28.8....if that...<br/>
<br/>
I share this computer with a person who likes to download lots of stuff <br/>
which slows the computer down.<br/>
<br/>
I use web-based email for several reasons, and because it's free, it loads <br/>
advertisments (slowly, of course) with every single LbNA post.<br/>
<br/>
Having to open every single message (usually only to find out that it's <br/>
about an area I'm not likely to visit soon) eats up an awful lot of time.<br/>
<br/>
If you will PLEASE put your state or province FIRST on the subject line, it <br/>
would be VERY helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you ever so much!<br/>
