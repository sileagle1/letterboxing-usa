     I went back out specifically to find Pokeyman #25, Egg-zactly and the<br/>
 Flutter-bye box.  I was unable to locate any of them and was particularly<br/>
 concerned about the location of the Pokeyman #25 box.  At the location where<br/>
 this one was to be found there was a small plastic bag with the words Log<br/>
 Book written on it in black ink impaled upon a metal fence post.  A search<br/>
 around that general area on the ground revealed nothing.  There was nothing<br/>
 in the plastic bag either...<br/>

I'll mark these as poached for now.  Very disappointing.  :o(<br/>
The last letterboxers there reported that some kids on the trail had been <br/>
watching them very closely.<br/>
