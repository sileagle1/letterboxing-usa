Welcome to you and your wife to the Wonderful World Of Letterboxing!  Sorry you didn't find the box; hope you enjoyed the hike though.<br/>
<br/>
I went up to both Pulpit Rock &amp; Pinnacle about 5 weeks ago and I was lucky enough to find both boxes.  Unless Marty has moved it, which I can't imagine without a post to the list, there are 2 other possibilities:  The box has disappeared or it's still there and you did not find it.<br/>
<br/>
I myself went in search of the MD box this weekend, and after "enjoying" and "exploring" the area for about 4 hours in all, was not able to find the box.  How well!  That'll make the next one I do find all the more exciting!<br/>
<br/>
Have you found any other boxes, or was this your first attempt?<br/>

        Pulpit Rock was the second letter box that we have looked for.  We<br/>
found the Valley Forge box a couple of weeks ago.  We would have gone on to<br/>
look for the Pinnacle box after the Pulpit Rock box, but we spent quite a<br/>
bit of time looking for the Pulpit Rock box and it was getting a bit late.<br/>
We are hoping that the box is still there so we have a good excuse to go<br/>
back to that lovely bit of PA.<br/>

I'm sorry that you didn't find the box.  I haven't been back to "check up on it" since February.  Looks like I'll have to take a stroll up ther and check on that one (and Pinnacle) soon.  I'll let the talk list know what I find.<br/>
