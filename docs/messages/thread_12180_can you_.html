                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's my understanding, too.  We have a box near us that changes <br/>
stamps seasonally but I don't think that everytime the stamp changes <br/>
the planter counts it as a new Plant or that the finders count it as a <br/>
new Find.  <br/>
<br/>
I have lots of stamps in my log book that don't have a "number" <br/>
significance.  For instance, I've exchanged with people when then were <br/>
using one stamp and later they carved a different stamp.  I like to  <br/>
get an impression of the new stamp, but I don't count it as a new <br/>
exchange.  Some people have a big stamp and a mini-stamp - I have <br/>
images of both but only count it as one exchange.  And I don't count <br/>
personal travellers as a different exchange - but maybe that's just <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
But the Count Police are not going to track anyone down to verify what <br/>
numbers they are reporting.  So if you want to count it, go ahead.  <br/>

<br/>
I would.  If I worked for it, and it went in the book, I'd count it.  I don't count returning to a box just for fun with another boxer.  I redid a few boxes this weekend with another friend, and I stamped them into my new book, but I wouldn't count them as a "find" because I let him find them. There was little work involved.  But, then again, I don't bother to count, really.  Betz and I counted once and were surprised that we had well over a hundred finds.  I thought maybe we had 60ish.  I have no idea how many I've garnered by now.  But, anyway, only the truly anal would care how _you_ count _your_ finds, IMHO.  So whatever you feel is right, you do.    If the numbers are important to you, you could decide to go by a strict standard. You don't need permission from anyone.  :-)  But we'll all talk about you behind your back when you rack up your first 500 Fs and they are mostly repeats.  ;-)<br/>

  Do you count a box twice if the stamp has changed and you go back to get the new one? I went back to get the hand carved Lake Frank Turtle, so I have that one and the store bought 'temp'. <br/>
