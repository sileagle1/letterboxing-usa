<br/>Difficulty: Easy Clues to figure out, Easy quick letterbox!
<br/>
<br/>This letterbox is placed at one of my favorite places to watch my church softball team play.  During the cold war, this site was a Nike Missile Radar site, and later was a ski slope.  Now, the military buildings house such businesses as a ballet school and a day care center, and it is also a recreation area, with a lighted baseball field and tennis courts.  Once you enter this area, park down by the military buildings.  Walk up the hill on the paved road between the slate blue and mustard colored buildings.  When you get to the top of the hill, you will notice a dirt section to your left and tennis courts to your right.  Start walking on the dirt section to your left.  This is the top of the old ski slope.  You will notice four electrical poles going down the center of the hill, with the last two having single wheels on them.  This was the ski lift.  After those four, you will find three more with double wheels on them.  Go to the second double wheeled electrical pole.  You will find your prize next to the pole underneath a flat rock.</body></html>
