                    <div class="plaintext-content">On November 21, 2002 Funhog placed the Bowl and Pitcher letterbox in<br/>
Riverside State Park, six miles northwest of Spokane city center, Spokane<br/>
County, Washington. This 10,000 acre park follows the Spokane River and<br/>
features a pedestrian suspension bridge, Indian pictographs, an historic<br/>
settlement and miles of trails.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: From I-90 go North on Maple Street to Francis Street.<br/>
Turn left and go west to Rifle Club Road which is marked by a brown<br/>
directional sign saying Riverside State Park/Bowl and Pitcher. Turn left<br/>
and keep left at the T, following the signs to the Bowl and Pitcher<br/>
Overlook parking area.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: From the rocky top of the Overlook you will be able to<br/>
see the route where you will make your crossing. Head downhill and traverse<br/>
the historic span. Once across, keep rails right and left. Don't stop to<br/>
feed the ants but keep their dining room and the hydraulic lullaby to your<br/>
right. The path is wide with many small diversions attempting to lure you<br/>
right and left. Avoid temptation and watch the sky. When dual lines are<br/>
overhead, halt. Retrace twenty two of your steps and a pair of evergreens<br/>
will be to your right. When you stand between these two sentinels, the<br/>
letterbox is but a step or two away, at 200 degrees magnetic.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On November 24, 2002 Funhog placed the Tundra Traveler letterbox at<br/>
Franz Lake near the town of Skamania, Skamania County, Washington.<br/>
During the summer  months this "lake" may not even hold a drop of<br/>
water but during the rest of the year it's got plenty. As a result,<br/>
this is the perfect winter home for those glorious, energetic visitors<br/>
from the far north, Tundra Swans. The area is part of the National<br/>
Wildlife Refuge system and is closed to public entry. However, there<br/>
is a viewing platform and interpretive signs along the highway. Bring<br/>
binoculars (and a spotting scope) if you have them. <br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: From Vancouver, WA, head east on Highway 14. The<br/>
Franz Lake Viewpoint is on the right between mileage markers 31 and 32. <br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: From the head of the platform the treasure lies at<br/>
255 degrees magnetic. Walk with thousands of diamonds to your left.<br/>
Once the diamonds disappear and  you  begin to feel galvanized, you<br/>
are standing right beside the box. It's guardian holds it gently in a<br/>
cupped had, secured by a steely grip. Roll away the stone.<br/>
