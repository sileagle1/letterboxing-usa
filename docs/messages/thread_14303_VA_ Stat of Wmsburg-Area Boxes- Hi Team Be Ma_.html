adventures. You have go back to York River now that there is a new <br/>
box in the park! Refering to your question: The adult stamp was in <br/>
the Pupa Box. We weren't sure why either.<br/>
<br/>
For clarification purposes, mlgainey is a separate letterboxer from <br/>
BobCat Crew. Mlgainey is great at planting boxes....BobCat Crew is, <br/>
well, a bit behind in planting boxes. Mlgainey is usually accompanied <br/>
by a pretty coon hound letterboxing dog named Bonny. BobCat Crew is <br/>
usually accompanied by one or two tall, whiney teenaged boys who want <br/>
the fast food that their mother bribed them with! Anyhow, mlgainey <br/>
and BobCat Crew team up periodically and search for boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to meet you sometime! I love reading about your adventures!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Susan!  Tell me the decision of which fast food to go to still isn't <br/>
determined by the Happy Meal toy...  The more things change....  Your teens <br/>
sound like my little ones.  I won't be able to break the news to Da that the <br/>
whining isn't going to stop as soon as we had hoped...<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the confusion with the two groups.  We would look forward to <br/>
seeing all of you!<br/>
<br/>
We're getting ready for a big BBQ at home so no boxing this past week.  We <br/>
did check out a local park as a possible plant sight for "peace of DC".  <br/>
Unfortunately, it looks like one of those weird it's on the map but you <br/>
can't quite get to it parks.  We kept tryinlg all the different roads in the <br/>
subdivision but they would end at houses.  I suppose the park is right <br/>
beyond....  You may only be able to access it from a bike path.  The roads <br/>
are very odd too.  You would enter from one side and then the road would <br/>
just end.  Then you'd drive all around to the other side of town and the <br/>
same road would pick up again -- never to meet and never to intersect the <br/>
park!  What a mystery box that would make!!  We like to plant our boxes <br/>
pretty near by so we can check them often.  Not only do we love seeing the <br/>
notes from people who have stamped in, but that's how we get most of our <br/>
HH's it seems.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the note!  BeMa<br/>
