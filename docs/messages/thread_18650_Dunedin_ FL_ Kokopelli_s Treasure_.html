<br/>
This box by Kokopelli is currently listed as Unclaimed on the main <br/>
site. We attempted it anyway about a week ago and were not able to <br/>
find the first sub-clue nor the box itself. <br/>
<br/>
We're snail-mailing a postcard to Kokopelli from another box of his <br/>
we found and asking about it but we were just wondering when the <br/>
last person found this box. <br/>
<br/>
To those intending to search, be warned that it *may* be missing <br/>
since it is a somewhat involved search in that it takes you to three <br/>
different places before going to find the actual box. Since we <br/>
couldn't find the first number, it may just be that we guessed wrong <br/>
for the final compass bearing (though we searched the entire area).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
