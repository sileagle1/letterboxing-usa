people who stop on our site is good. "Addicts love company"  hehehe<br/>
Please let me know as well, I'd be interested in placing it in my new<br/>
boxes. <br/>
Also, have a question about European Letterboxes.  Some of my German<br/>
friends that I speak with have visited the site and are now wanting me<br/>
to create the boxes and they will look after them.  My father is going<br/>
over there in a few months.  He is going to be distirbuting them.  Has<br/>
anyone ever done this before?  let me know.  thanks die xoxo<br/>

&gt; I remember seeing a thorough, nicely formatted<br/>
&gt; 2-page description/introduction to L-boxing a few<br/>
&gt; months back.  Actually, I think Mitch might have put<br/>
&gt; it together.  I believe the intent was to be able to<br/>
&gt; include it in boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is this still available?  Can it be reached via<br/>
&gt; LBNA?  I don't seem to be able to find it anymore. <br/>
&gt; Would it be worthwhile to have it accessible on the<br/>
&gt; website?<br/>
