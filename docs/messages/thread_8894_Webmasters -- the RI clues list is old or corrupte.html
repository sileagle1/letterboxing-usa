<br/>
the RI list of clues is missing many of the recent letterboxes that <br/>
were posted.  The list literally went from 202 boxes to 191 over <br/>
night.  There are at least 5 box clues that I know of that are <br/>
missing.  Did perhaps an old clue list get updated and posted by <br/>
accident?<br/>
<br/>
just wanted to let you know,<br/>

Hi Janet,<br/>
<br/>
I just took a quick peek at the RI list.  Right away I noticed that <br/>
all the letterboxes that are known to be lost forever are removed <br/>
from the list.  I can think of just one right off the top of my head <br/>
(Harbor of Refuge) that had 3 letterboxes to it which I had found <br/>
over a year ago but have been missing for a year.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the list is in the process of being cleaned up?  I, for one, <br/>
am very grateful if this is the case.  Nothing more frustrating that <br/>
printing out clues, going for the hunt, being unsuccessful, then <br/>
hearing later "Oh yeah, that box has been gone for months!".<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the newer boxes will be re-added once the older boxes have been <br/>
cleaned up.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe I don't what the heck I am talking about and should shut <br/>
up ;-)<br/>

  We noticed that the two of ours are missing from the list as well <br/>
and we have not heard anything about them being missing!  The last <br/>
one is only a couple weeks old.  What's up with the list!? <br/>
