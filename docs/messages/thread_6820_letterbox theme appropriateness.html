the NW corner of CT. I don't have time to carve even though I'd like to.<br/>
So when I get a chance I will plant a box or two with commercial stamps<br/>
most likely.<br/>

<br/>
Some boxes have stamps that relate to the box's location, others have <br/>
random themes. If you can think of an image that fits the place--and <br/>
if you have the skills to carve something fancy--great!  If you just <br/>
want to carve a particular image and use that image in your next box, <br/>
wherever the box may go, that's fine, too.  Some of my stamps relate <br/>
specifically to their box locations, others don't.  One of my most <br/>
popular boxes--This Little Pig in Amherst, Mass.--has no relation <br/>
whatsoever to the hiding place, yet people seem especially drawn to <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Do whatever you feel like doing.  I have yet to be disappointed in any <br/>
handcarved stamp that I have found.  They are all great, whether <br/>
highly detailed or very simple.  I just love seeing the images that <br/>
people make.  <br/>
<br/>
I must admit I am a little disappointed when I find a box with a <br/>
storebought stamp.  Of course it's fun to do the hike and decipher the <br/>
clue, but I feel a little less excited about those boxes.<br/>

My carving skills aren't great yet...so I may put a store bought stamp out <br/>
once in a while...but I make sure that the stamp is appropriate to the <br/>
location...<br/>
<br/>
And if you go to Sleeping Giant State Park for the letterboxes...you have to <br/>
make a point to go to Wentworth's for the Ice Cream...that alone is worth <br/>
the trip...Also try Aunt Chilada's for lunch...best Mexican Restaurant in <br/>
CT!!!<br/>
