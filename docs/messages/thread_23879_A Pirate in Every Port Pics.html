  Pics are great. I had to take of everything after dot com to get the link to work.<br/>

  One correction: Lallah is Stalking Wolf of Team DNA. HandsTwo's grand daughters were the little blonde and brunette, Connie and I can't remember the others name, but they were both just gorgeous. All of the kids were, and so good! Some were happy and boisterous and others a little shy and tentative at first, but once they got into the swing of things that all got along so well and really behaved great. Nicholas was just a little love bug and I really enjoyed playing with him. <br/>
