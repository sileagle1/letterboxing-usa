                    <div class="plaintext-content">HI ALL,<br/>
I WENT FOR A NICE LETTERBOXING HIKE TODAY IN ONE OF MY FAVORITE <br/>
PLACES HERE IN CT. I DECIDED TO GO AT ABOUT 5PM SINCE I HAD JUST <br/>
GOTTEN OFF WORK.IT WAS A LITTLE MISTY, SLIGHTLY HUMID AND THE <br/>
TEMPERATURE WAS BEARABLE. WHEN I STARED MY HIKE EVERYTHING WAS FINE. <br/>
ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THE HIKE I WAS SWARMED BY 20 TO 30 DEERFLIES. <br/>
I ENDED UP FINISHING THE WALK EARLY AS I HAD TO PULL MY SHIRT UP <br/>
OVER MY HEAD IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM FROM BITING MY HEAD AND NECK. I <br/>
WONDER IF ANYONE OUT THERE HAS ANY SUGGESTIONS OF HOW TO KEEP THESE <br/>
LITTLE BUGGERS AT BAY. IF ANYONE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT A DEERFLY IS IT <br/>
IS SIMILAR IN SIZE TO A SMALL HORSEFLY WITH A SLIGHT YELLOWISH TINGE <br/>
TO IT, CLEAR WINGS WITH BLACK TRIM AND BITE LIKE THE DICKENS.<br/>
<br/>
THANKS<br/>
THE SCHECKS<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I lead nature walks, I always tell people that it helps to wear a hat. <br/>
They tend to prefer to land and bite on the top of the head or near the ears <br/>
where the skin is thin and easy to bite. With a hat on they will often sit on <br/>
the top of your hat and look and look but never find a spot to bite. It's <br/>
certainly not foolproof, but it helps.<br/>
<br/>
If I'm caught without a hat I usually look for bracken fern which is a three <br/>
pronged fern. If you invert the fern and wear it like a funny sort of hat it <br/>
definitely helps. They'll  land on the fern stock and search, but not find you. <br/>
Be careful not to go ripping up ferns like crazy, though. Only use it in an <br/>
'emergency'.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, they are one of those amazingly pesky critters that will <br/>
actually chase you quite a long way. Once they start flying laps around your head, <br/>
you may as well give up on being able to concentrate. I usually high-tail it <br/>
out of the area and hope I can outrun them, because they hurt and they will <br/>
bite repeatedly!!<br/>
<br/>
For my fellow MA boxers, beware that Borderland State park in Sharon, MA is a <br/>
reeeeeeeally bad deerfly area this time of year. I usually remember that fact <br/>
when I'm stumbling through the woods trying to outrun them and swatting <br/>
frantically like a crazed windmill.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully that will help....though I have a mental image of letterboxers <br/>
trooping around with ferny elf hats like my little summer camp kids. LOL<br/>
