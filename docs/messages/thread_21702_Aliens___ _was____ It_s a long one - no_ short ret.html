&gt; aliens abduct <br/>
&gt; children, implant their alien brain in them and<br/>
&gt; return them to <br/>
&gt; earth.Then about 20 years old they're abducted<br/>
&gt; again, have the alien <br/>
&gt; brain removed and are returned to earth. It's not<br/>
&gt; their fault it is <br/>
&gt; all caused by the damn aliens.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

These are probably the same aliens that are<br/>
responsible for stealing letterboxes.  In Texas and<br/>
Louisiana, our letterbox-stealing, brain-stealing<br/>
aliens also eat beignets, hence the term we have<br/>
attached to them - BEA's - Beignet-Eating Aliens.  <br/>
<br/>
At our recent gathering we attempted to establish an<br/>
open dialog with the aliens via an emissary that BoxDN<br/>
brought along, but when one box actually went missing<br/>
on the day of the gathering (and not just any box, but<br/>
one of the boxes that was pivotal to the Wild West<br/>
Clue game), negotiations broke down and we wound up<br/>
hanging him (the emissary, not BoxDN) in effigy<br/>
instead.  I don't think that helped intergalactic<br/>
relations, but we were surely unhappy Texans and<br/>
honorary Texans and we feel we were quite justified in<br/>
our abuse.  Had we realized these were the same aliens<br/>
that were stealing teenage brains, we probably would<br/>
have worked harder at negotiating, but hindsight is<br/>
20/20 and all that stuff, ya know...<br/>

I was wondering when the BEA's would be brought up on this list.  I <br/>
thought that by the end of the day we would have come to a conclusion <br/>
to the missing boxes but when the anvil showed up missing we had to <br/>
take matters into our own hands.  To think the BEA's outwitted us by <br/>
setting up a decoy while the others snuck into the woods and stole our <br/>
game stamp.  <br/>

And all this time I was thinking it was the park ranger who confiscated <br/>
the gavel...something about retribution for night hiking in search of <br/>
a 'missing wallet'?  ;)<br/>
