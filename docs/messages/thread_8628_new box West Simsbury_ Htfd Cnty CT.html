                    <html><body> Directed Paths Box  West Simsbury, Hartford Cnty, CT<br/>
&gt; Onion Mt Park,<br/>
&gt; W Simsbury Rd, near Flamig Farm on Shingle Mill Rd<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pull in past the stone house and park.  To the right is a fishing<br/>
&gt; area, or at least a pond.  There is a trail map container and if you<br/>
&gt; are lucky you will find one there.  I didn't and still made out OK.<br/>
&gt; Take the trail at 250 degrees <br/>
&gt; Then follow the yellow trail beyond the gate<br/>
&gt; cross bar.<br/>
&gt; Pass the fire circle on the left and then at the junction take the<br/>
&gt; trail to the left (150 degrees).  This bends to the left and then to<br/>
&gt; the right as you go along.  Just keep to the yellow blazes and you'll<br/>
&gt; be fine.  Pass a bunch of downed trees  real near the trail.  Stand<br/>
&gt; between the sawed logs and direct your path ahead 15 paces to a yellow<br/>
&gt; blazed tree.  A straight compass reading of 260 degrees leads you to<br/>
&gt; your prize BUT direct your steps along the path to the 2nd yellow<br/>
&gt; blaze.  With your back to the blaze your path is directed at 330<br/>
&gt; degrees and about 10 steps.<br/>
&gt; Continue on the yellow trail after you have stamped in.  This joins<br/>
&gt; the blue for a bit and becomes yellow again. This takes you back to<br/>
&gt; your car.<br/>
&gt; Look for future boxes in this park.  I have a trail map and know how<br/>
&gt; to use it!<br/>
