missed well over 2000 messages!),but can't say as I much mind since <br/>
in the meantime I've managed to get in several gorgeous weeks of <br/>
backpacking and finally finish up my 5th AT in Maine!(Bigelows to <br/>
Baxter) Pete met me in Monson for a short sidetrip to the National <br/>
Folklife Festival in Bangor and a little local letterboxing, so I'm <br/>
pleased to say that, 'packing through that final so-called "100-mile <br/>
wilderness" section of the AT, I actually got to carry with me a <br/>
couple of letterboxing trinkets left in some boxes up there by our <br/>
dear friends, namely: a tiny harmonica/trail-necklace left by <br/>
Floating Feather in one of her boxes, and a packet of Pez left by <br/>
RIBNAG Ben in one of his! Thanks,guys, for that little extra boost <br/>
that helped to get me through the "wilderness"! This was especially <br/>
important to me since it was the 20th anniversary of my first <br/>
backpack ever, which just happened to be that very same 100-mile <br/>
section back in 1982 that set me off on my subsequent backpacking <br/>
spree, but which I didn't think I was going to be able to finish this <br/>
year due to some really nasty injuries!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, now I'm happy to be back home with Pete, celebrating our 10th <br/>
wedding anniversary with a new round of letterboxing! Pete had a <br/>
whole stack of new clues waiting for me to sort when I got home, and <br/>
we've already managed to do several dozen of them, including Airmail<br/>
(F1400), the delightful CT Quest:Hero's Journey on our anniversary, <br/>
and quite a few new varieties of flora and fauna! Once we get caught <br/>
up again locally, we'll try to head out to some of those "further" <br/>
boxes - like NJ,PA,MA,etc, - that we've been wanting to get to for so <br/>
long, but just haven't had the time. We'd also have loved to have <br/>
been able to attend some of those gatherings Pete tells me folks are <br/>
planning in VA,OH and NC, but probably the only one we'll be able to <br/>
swing will be the Children's Gathering at Rocky Neck SP,CT on Oct.20<br/>
(maybe we'll pretend to be kids again and come as Wendy &amp; Peter Pan!)<br/>
Hope to see a lot of you there - old friends and new - and thanks <br/>
again to all who have contributed to making letterboxing such a fun, <br/>
vibrant and diverse hobby!<br/>
