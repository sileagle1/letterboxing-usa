<br/>
Last spring, we bought tickets for a comedy show in<br/>
Boston. Yesterday, we made the trip out a little<br/>
early, and grabbed a few boxes before the show.<br/>
<br/>
We were the second people to find the Battle of Bunker<br/>
Hill. The first finder was there only the day before<br/>
we were. Thanks to Ryan and Amanda for our first taste<br/>
of big city boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Surprisingly enough, we found parking near the Public<br/>
Gardens right away, and stamped into both This<br/>
American Life and Head By The Charles. Both of these<br/>
boxes have seen numerous visitors, including one group<br/>
from Kansas. Thanks to the placers of both of these<br/>
for their creative ways to hide in such public places.<br/>
Let me tell you, trying to discreetly get them, stamp<br/>
in and rehide wasn't easy, but was the best part of<br/>
the experience!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the best part of the day was the show.<br/>
First row balcony for Eddie Izzard, two hours of all<br/>
new material. Fantastic jokes! Fantastic make-up! :-)<br/>
