<br/>
We will be traveling to Rockland, Maine soon and would like to know <br/>
if there are any easy letterboxes that we might be able to find just <br/>
off of our routes on the way up. We will be traveling on I-90 / I-<br/>
495 / I-95 through Massachusetts; I-95 through New Hampshire; I-95 <br/>
until Brunswick and then route 1 to Rockland in Maine. Maybe you <br/>
could even let us know if there are any "Must See" places along the <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any suggestions, please contact us off list at <br/>

<br/>
Happy letterboxing!<br/>

Park, Urban Forestry Center, Newcastle historic Fort).  And Fort <br/>
McClary Park in Kittery ME.  Also be sure to check out Ogunquit Beach <br/>
(no boxes; but beautiful area).  Then there is Wolf Neck State Park <br/>
(along Casco Bay Trail) in Freeport (near LLBean).  Happy Trails!<br/>
