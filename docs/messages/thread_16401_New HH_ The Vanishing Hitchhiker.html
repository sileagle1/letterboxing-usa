<br/>
There are many variations of the story, but my favorite is: <br/>
<br/>
On a cold and rainy night, a young man is on his way to a party at a <br/>
local dance hall and on his way there, he happens to offer a ride to <br/>
an attractive young woman who agrees to go with him to the dance. <br/>
Everyone at the party found her to be very charming and after the <br/>
dance was over, the young man offered to drive her home as the night <br/>
had turned quite chilly. She accepted and because it was so cold out, <br/>
he gave her his coat to wear. <br/>
<br/>
He asked for her address and she gave it to him and a short time <br/>
later, they pulled into the driveway of the house where the girl said <br/>
that she lived and the driver turned to tell her that they had <br/>
arrived. To his astonishment, she was gone! The passenger seat of the <br/>
car was empty, although the door had never opened - the girl had <br/>
simply vanished.<br/>
<br/>
Not knowing what else to do, the man went up to the door and knocked. <br/>
An elderly woman answered the door and he explained to her what had <br/>
happened. Right away, she seemed to know exactly what he was talking <br/>
about. The young girl he had taken to the dance was her daughter - <br/>
but she had died ten years before in an auto accident. <br/>
<br/>
The horrified young man didn't believe her, even though the name of <br/>
the girl he had taken to the dance and the woman's daughter were the <br/>
same. In order to convince him, the old woman even told him where to <br/>
find the grave of the dead girl in the local cemetery. The young man <br/>
quickly drove there and following the directions he had been given, <br/>
found the stone with the girl's name on it. Folded neatly over the <br/>
top of the marker was the coat that the girl had borrowed to ward off <br/>
the night chill!<br/>
<br/>
So look for the Vanishing Hitchhiker in a letterbox near you! But do <br/>
not be surprised if it disappears before your very eyes!<br/>
