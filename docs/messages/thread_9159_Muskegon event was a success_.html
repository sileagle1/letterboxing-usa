&gt;Geocaching was a big success! <br/>
<br/>
&gt;For her first box, we went to "Ghosts Below". She squealed with <br/>
&gt;delight when she found it with very little help (if any) from me &amp; ?<br/>
&gt;was rewarded with not only her first ever find, but also <br/>
&gt;being 'first finder' for this box (since it was only placed last <br/>
&gt;weekend). It's a mystery box &amp; Diana said solving the clues was fun! <br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a great weekend!  Glad to hear that you had the chance to <br/>
get to some of my boxes in Grand Haven and Muskegon.  Particularly <br/>
happy to hear that "Ghosts Below" was found, as I wasn't sure about <br/>
the clues being too hard, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;Then we picked up the clues from the asterisk to find 'A Kind of <br/>
&gt;Summer'. We thought we had followed them to the conclusion, but then <br/>
&gt;found the 'bench' that was mentioned. So we started over &amp; think we <br/>
&gt;found the spot the box was supposed to be, but no box :-(  <br/>
<br/>
I will get out to check on the "A Kind of Summer" box to verify its <br/>
status within the next few days.  Isn't that just a wonderful park?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I do believe we have several new letterboxing junkies as a result <br/>
&gt;of this weekend. :-) <br/>
<br/>
Soooooo happy to hear that there may be some new letterboxers in the <br/>
area!  Would love to see the hobby take off here.<br/>
