Well, by now hopefully it's no mystery to anyone who the special<br/>
people are that we are honoring this year with our "LLAA".  We think<br/>
ever so highly of Jay and Carolyn, and we're already looking forward<br/>
to the nice things we'll have to say about some of next year's<br/>
recipients as well!<br/>
<br/>
Now we'd like to tell you people on the talk list where we think some<br/>
of YOU should go - back to the talk list!  Yes, that's right - back to<br/>
our original post on this subject:  message #53078.  Perhaps it might<br/>
be difficult to spot if one were in a highly charged emotional state<br/>
(I guess that's why they call it a "blind fury"! "-), but it's right<br/>
there in black and white:  the words "This LETTERBOX" (sixth word in<br/>
the second sentence, for those having trouble counting! :-)  So<br/>
please, folks, try not to be so hasty in your reading, judging, or<br/>
jumping to conclusions!<br/>
<br/>
As for that important distinction between "recognition" and<br/>
"competition", every single person we talked to previously about this<br/>
"LLAA" project seemed to understand it immediately (a good sign of a<br/>
healthy ego - not to begrudge other people's accomplishments of feel a<br/>
need to compete with them!)  We hope others come to understand this<br/>
concept as well.  There is simply nothing to compete over here.  We<br/>
just wish to acknowledge in somewhat chronological fashion those who<br/>
have already accomplished "great things" for letterboxing, using the<br/>
high standards they themselves have set!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone who understood and supported our desire to<br/>
honor our "letterboxng heroes".  For those we had specifically told<br/>
earlier about this particular letterbox, but who "seemed to have<br/>
forgotten", we do accept your apologies.  And if anything good is to<br/>
come of these little talk list "furors", let it be that they at least<br/>
encourage more people to go and find out who some of our early<br/>
super-achieving letterboxing benefactors really were!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Wanda and Pete<br/>

Well, by now hopefully it's no mystery to anyone who the special<br/>
people are that we are honoring this year with our "LLAA".  We think<br/>
ever so highly of Jay and Carolyn, and we're already looking forward<br/>
to the nice things we'll have to say about some of next year's<br/>
recipients as well!<br/>

:"&gt;Please read this as an embarssed letterboxer.  I have been following the Oscar fun and would hope someday to visit one of the winner's letterboxes or appreciate their stamp in a box I might find.  But alas, after searching the database at this site, AtlasQuest and LBNA I still don't know who Jay and Carolyn are.  I looked through some of the back messages, but must have missed it there, too.<br/>
<br/>
Would someone be able to enlighten me to the trail names of Jay and Carolyn unless that is a secret, too - oh maybe this is one of those mystery boxes. . .<br/>
<br/>
Well, congratulations Jay and Carolyn.<br/>
