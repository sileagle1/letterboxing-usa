on Monty Python's The Search for the Holy Grail.  You can find current<br/>
information at the following site:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/the_lb_dragon/Search_for_the_Holy_Grail.htm<br/>
<br/>
As the project manager, I am about to close the window on letterboxers<br/>
getting involved in this project, but I'm willing to take on a few<br/>
more interested letterboxers if you get back to me by Sunday night.<br/>
<br/>
If you are a letterboxer in the Great Lakes region that, as of until<br/>
now, has not heard of the project but would like to get involved, you<br/>
may get involved as a stamp creator and/or box planter.  Email me with<br/>
what you'd like to do!<br/>
<br/>
If you are a letterboxer outside the Great Lakes region that would<br/>
like to create a box for the series to be sent to someone in the Great<br/>
Lakes region to hide the box for you, let me know!<br/>
<br/>
At the above link, you'll see a listing of suggested box/stamp themes<br/>
and an indication of those which have already been signed-up for.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Dragon<br/>
