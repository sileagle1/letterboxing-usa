<br/>
I owe you all a heartfelt apology for having abandoned the group lately.  I'm <br/>
afraid I managed to put entirely too much on my proverbial plate.<br/>
<br/>
I'm taking 23 credit hours this semester, not including extra computer lab <br/>
time.  This translates to both night and day classes, six days a week!!!<br/>
<br/>
The good news is that I love my classes, and am expecting straight A's in <br/>
every class.  I'm attending Portland Community College and pursuing three <br/>
majors simultaneously:  Technical and Professional Writing, Technical <br/>
Illustration and Publication, and Multimedia Authoring.<br/>
<br/>
The bad news is that I've had to blow off all my dear friends and lose sight <br/>
of my hobbies as a result.  Fortunately, the semester is almost over.  I have <br/>
no intention of enrolling in that many classes at once EVER AGAIN!!!   <br/>
(whew!!!)<br/>
<br/>
So, as I polish up all my final class projects and begin to look toward the <br/>
holidays, I want to take a rare moment to thank you ALL for your patience and <br/>
concern regarding my absence from the talk list.  I'm sure there are many <br/>
loose ends that I have lost sight of... please feel free to bring them to my <br/>
attention.<br/>
<br/>
I sincerely apologize for any and all inconveniences caused by my neglect.<br/>

must slow down you know. Still looking for the clues I sent you, to appear on <br/>
the big map. Just back from a large horse fair in Springfield Mass, and have <br/>
been getting tons of mail from east coast horse folks and some are asking <br/>
about "letterboxing" I guess I got a little into that with some folks and the <br/>
word got out, You know horse folks cover a lot of country and the <br/>
possibilities for boxes are endless. Good thing for all I would say. Glad to <br/>
see your back and,, have a happy turkey day ,, to all.  The Ramblers<br/>

&gt; must slow down you know. Still looking for the clues I sent you, to appear on<br/>
&gt; the big map. <br/>
<br/>
Unless there are large graphics involved, it always makes sense to post<br/>
the clues (or links to them) to the list, rather than an individual <br/>
webmaster or one of the state lists, for all sorts of reasons (busy<br/>
or awol webmasters or list managers, for clues outside of New England,<br/>
Mitch and I both work on them, for clues in New England, Tom works on<br/>
them, people get the clues faster, there is less pressure on the <br/>
webmasters, they are archived at egroups, etc, etc).<br/>
