I am new to letterboxing- well sort of. I have yet to get out and<br/>
actually find a box yet because of health reasons. A friend gave me the<br/>
link to this site and I was instantly intrigued. I subscribed to the<br/>
group and began getting the digests. Honestly- I have been mortified at<br/>
the tone of a lot of the posts. Some people are so hostile, it seems<br/>
there is always an argument going on here. That is why I have not posted<br/>
here before this. Y'all scared me away. I was afraid to ask a newbie<br/>
question, afraid of offering an opinion on anything for fear of the<br/>
flaming. I can understand the repetitive questions can get boring but<br/>
really folks- either answer them or don't- why get your knickers in a<br/>
twist because someone doesn't know what you already know or didn't look<br/>
at the right spot to get an answer before asking the group? Everyone,<br/>
including yourself has to start somewhere. Rather then making people feel<br/>
welcome you intimidate them- what's that all about? Now I know not<br/>
everyone is so hostile and I hate to paint the whole group with such a<br/>
broad brush stroke but gee whiz folks- I am pretty assertive and<br/>
outgoing, if I have been scared off the group I imagine that there must<br/>
be others out there who feel the same way. I also do not expect everyone<br/>
to be all warm and fuzzy to newbies- so then just ignore them why don't<br/>
ya? Honestly, I have considered unsubscribing a number of times, hung<br/>
around and watched some of the battles with fascination, like one just<br/>
has to look at a car wreck. I also have hopes that someday when my health<br/>
is better the group will be a help to me. Exactly what is this group for?<br/>
Isn't it here to help people get started and then keep people informed<br/>
about what is happening in the world of boxing? My suggestion- be nicer,<br/>
be more understanding of the newbies and all their questions. Extend the<br/>
hand of friendship to others who are interested in getting out and<br/>
boxing. It's painless and you just might make someone's day!   Jeanne434<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hear Hear Jeanne!  I would have to agree with you.  I've been only lurking <br/>
(not really posting) for about a year now, because of all of the flaming on this <br/>
list.  I've gotten to the point now that I don't read any mail from this list <br/>
unless the subject line specifically pertains to me.  Because of this, I've <br/>
missed most of the flaming as of late.<br/>
<br/>
I don't understand why everyone gets into a tizzy everytime a new person asks <br/>
a question.  If it's something you've heard before, delete the post, help the <br/>
person out, whatever, but these posts of hatred need to stop.<br/>
<br/>
To Jeanne:  most of the letterboxers I've met are kind and wonderful people <br/>
(even Brian.... except that he flies off the handle sometimes) who are more <br/>
than willing to help others out.  Don't blame the whole list for the few who have <br/>
a tendency to be mean.<br/>
