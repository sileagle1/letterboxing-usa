Just wanted to introduce myself. I am Amy in Alaska. <br/>
I live in Juneau and am fairly new to letterboxing.  I<br/>
finally got all my supplies to carve a stamp and will<br/>

<br/>
I do have a slight dilema.  We only have TWO<br/>
leterboxes in town!  -One of which I have already<br/>
found.<br/>
<br/>
We are surrounded by glaciers, ocean and mountains so<br/>
there are no roads in or out of town.  You have to fly<br/>
or take a boat/ferry.  So I can't drive to the next<br/>
town over to see what they have, LOL. <br/>
It's a bummer.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand the hiking and trails in town are<br/>
amazing and the opportunities to place letterboxes are<br/>
great.<br/>
<br/>
Later this month I will be hitting the other letterbox<br/>
in town (it's atop a mountain).  And at that point I<br/>
will have hit all the boxes currently in town.  <br/>
<br/>
There are quite a few geocachers in town and we do<br/>
this as well (my kids prefer it).  But I would like to<br/>
plant my own letterboxes.   <br/>
<br/>
We get an unbelievable amount of tourists in town from<br/>
the cruise ship industry and I thought it would be fun<br/>
to give visiting letterboxers (and locals) more to<br/>
find.  And maybe get someone to leave a few  for me to<br/>
find too, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
I will be searching the files and looking at other<br/>
letterboxes out of state, studying clues to find out<br/>
what makes a good one, etc.  Mostly I will lurk but<br/>

After you find all the letterboxes in your state of "Alaska' ,and are<br/>
comfortable with your carvings you could get a list from the LbNa group<br/>
and start a "Postal Letterbox".<br/>
that might be fun for you.??!!<br/>
That way you can collect a few of other letterboxesr stamps for your<br/>
book.<br/>

<br/>
What a wonderful place to live!  I lived in Fairbanks<br/>
and Anchorage until I was 15, and loved being there.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, maybe you could place a box next to the front<br/>
door or something to encourage any letterboxers that<br/>
do come by to stop, stamp and say, "Hi!"<br/>
<br/>
Of course if you plant enough, maybe a gathering could<br/>
be planned on a cruise ship...<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<br/>
I live in CT - the land of letterboxing fanatics!  There is virtually a letterbox behind every tree here and I feel your pain about the amount of letterboxes there are in AK.  I vacationed in your state this year and wanted to do some boxing while I was there, but there wasn't much to choose from in the areas that I visited.  My brother lives in Anchorage and I visited him this year - incorporating a little letteringboxing while in the Land of the Midnight Sun.  While there, I planted a letterbox at Eklutna Lake with a stamp carved by Rush Gatherer and PowWow Dancer from Connecticut.  The reason being that I wanted to create more boxes in AK so that the residents and vacationers would have more to find!  I'm glad that you are using your carving skills and planting boxes in your area.  I'm sure Letterboxers will appreciate your efforts, whether they are residents or tourists.<br/>
<br/>
Who knows?  Maybe your enthusiasm for letterboxing will start a wave of interest in your area!  Talk it up - "word of mouth" can go a long way!  Not unlike the statement that Galadriel made to Frodo in the Lord of the Rings - "Even the smallest of people can change the course of the world."<br/>

The cruise ships come right through here, some days we have 15,000 <br/>
tourists and more.  <br/>

Anybody want to take a cruise?  : )<br/>

I have never been to Fairbanks but I hear they have a killer ice <br/>

We get enough tourists that if each of you bring a box with you when <br/>
you come visit it won't be long before we have as many as CT, ; ). <br/>

We are two and half times bigger than Texas so you would think we <br/>

I have been working on my quasi-uncle in Anchorage and I think I have<br/>
him somewhat hooked on letterboxing. I know he has friends in Juneau<br/>
so he does go out there from time to time. I will push him to place on<br/>
there if he ever gets around to it!!!<br/>

I thought I lived in a remote region in coastal Maine!!!<br/>

  Subject: [LbNA] Introduction from Alaska<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Hi all,<br/>
  Just wanted to introduce myself. I am Amy in Alaska. <br/>
  I live in Juneau and am fairly new to letterboxing.  I<br/>
  finally got all my supplies to carve a stamp and will<br/>
  try my hand at that this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
  I do have a slight dilema.  We only have TWO<br/>
  leterboxes in town!  -One of which I have already<br/>
  found.<br/>
<br/>
  We are surrounded by glaciers, ocean and mountains so<br/>
  there are no roads in or out of town.  You have to fly<br/>
  or take a boat/ferry.  So I can't drive to the next<br/>
  town over to see what they have, LOL. <br/>
  It's a bummer.  <br/>
<br/>
  On the other hand the hiking and trails in town are<br/>
  amazing and the opportunities to place letterboxes are<br/>
  great.<br/>
<br/>
  Later this month I will be hitting the other letterbox<br/>
  in town (it's atop a mountain).  And at that point I<br/>
  will have hit all the boxes currently in town.  <br/>
<br/>
  There are quite a few geocachers in town and we do<br/>
  this as well (my kids prefer it).  But I would like to<br/>
  plant my own letterboxes.   <br/>
<br/>
  We get an unbelievable amount of tourists in town from<br/>
  the cruise ship industry and I thought it would be fun<br/>
  to give visiting letterboxers (and locals) more to<br/>
  find.  And maybe get someone to leave a few  for me to<br/>
  find too, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
  I will be searching the files and looking at other<br/>
  letterboxes out of state, studying clues to find out<br/>
  what makes a good one, etc.  Mostly I will lurk but<br/>
  just wanted to say hello and let you know I am here.<br/>
<br/>
  Cheers, : )<br/>
  Amy in Alaska<br/>

My name is a Rachel and I also live in Juneau and I have planted the third <br/>
letterbox in Juneau.  I posted it on the LBNA website, it's out by the Eagle <br/>
Glacier Cabin.  I don't have time to write more to you at the moment, just wanted <br/>
you to know I am here, and I am excited to be planting  (and hopefully <br/>
finding) letterboxes here too.  Lots of fun!<br/>
