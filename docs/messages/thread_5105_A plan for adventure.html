<p>Hi, friends</p>
<p>I am an Iraqi living in Lebanon I have a plan for a trip to Greece, Turkey and Syria, you can read the details in this message or on my website   <a href="http://geocities.com/ossam33/question6.html"> http://geocities.com/ossam33/question6.html</a></p>
<p>I am waiting for your comments and opinions&gt;</p>
<p>MY JOURNEY TO EUROPE :::<br/>The target is to going to any country in central of Europe, to find a better chance to start my life.<br/>So I can help my family my people in Iraq and the disabled peoples (( the refuges, asylum seekers)) in Lebanon or all over the world .
</p><p>I'll start in next Summer, I need to pass Syria and Turkey ,for there I have two ways :::<br/>1- Greece<br/>2-Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria.
</p><p>Like you see the trip to Greece is too short but according to my information there are much control on the border of Greece but what I can do I need to try.
</p><p>In my plan I depend on the sea to pass the border as you know I don't have passport, so I'll do like this I try to reach as possible as I can to the border with the coast, at the night I'll go in the sea, I'll swim in the sea until I reach the another country according to the maps I need to swim between 10 KM to 20 KM and I have the capabilities to do this because I am a sailor and I had trained my self too much.
</p><p>And because I'll pass all these countries illegally I have a simple plan to pretending like I am tourist .<br/>So my friends I need any information about the life in these countries, I hope gratefully if you have, send it to me.</p>
<p>good luck<br/>sincerely<br/>Osam Altaee   <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ossam33">www.geocities.com/ossam33</a><br/></p><p><br/></p><hr size="1"/><b>Do You Yahoo!?</b><br/>
