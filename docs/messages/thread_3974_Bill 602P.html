<br/>
Guess the warnings were true. Federal Bill 602P 5-cents per E-mail sent.<br/>
It figures!  No more free E-mail! We knew this was coming!! Bill 602P<br/>
will permit the Federal Government to charge a 5-cent charge on every<br/>
delivered<br/>
E-mail.  Please read the following carefully if you intend to stay online<br/>
and continue using E-mail.  The last few months have revealed an alarming<br/>
trend<br/>
in the Government of the United States attempting to quietly push through<br/>
legislation that will affect our use of the Internet.<br/>
<br/>
Under proposed legislation, the US Postal Service will be attempting to<br/>
bill E-mail users out of "alternative postage fees."<br/>
<br/>
Bill 602P will permit the Federal Government to charge a 5-cent surcharge<br/>
on every e-mail delivered, by billing Internet Service Providers at source.<br/>
The consumer would then be billed in turn by the ISP.<br/>
<br/>
Washington DC lawyer Richard Stepp is working without pay to prevent this<br/>
legislation from becoming law. The US Postal Service is claiming lost<br/>
revenue, due to the proliferation of E-mail, is costing nearly $230,000,000<br/>
in revenue per year. You may have noticed their recent ad campaign: "There<br/>
is nothing like a letter."<br/>
<br/>
Since the average person received about 10 pieces of E-mail per day in<br/>
1998, the cost of the typical individual would be an additional 50 cents a<br/>
day --<br/>
or over $180 per year -- above and beyond their regular Internet costs.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this would be money paid directly to the US Postal Service for a<br/>
service they do not even provide.<br/>
<br/>
The whole point of the Internet is democracy and noninterference. You are<br/>
already paying an exorbitant price for snail mail because of bureaucratic<br/>
inefficiency.  It currently takes up to 6 days for a letter to be delivered<br/>
from coast to coast.  If the US Postal Service is allowed to tinker with<br/>
E-mail, it will mark the end of the "free" Internet in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
Congressional representative, Tony Schnell (R) has even suggested a "$20-$40<br/>
per month surcharge on all Internet service" above and beyond the<br/>
governments proposed E-mail charges.  Note that most of the major newspapers<br/>
have ignored the story the only exception being the Washingtonian which<br/>
called the idea of E-mail surcharge "a useful concept who's time has come"<br/>
(March 6th, 1999 Editorial).  Do not sit by and watch your freedom erode<br/>
away!<br/>
<br/>
Send this E-mail to EVERYONE on your list, and tell all your friends and<br/>
relatives to write their congressional representative and   say "NO" to Bill<br/>
602P.<br/>
<br/>
It will only take a few moments of your time and could very well be<br/>
instrumental in killing a bill we do not want.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE FORWARD!<br/>
