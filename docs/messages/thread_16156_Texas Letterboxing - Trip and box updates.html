                    <div class="plaintext-content">Babybear!!!! Thank you so much for making the trip to find my <br/>
letterboxes AND for placing some more down here for me to find! <br/>
<br/>
I am amazed by your itinerary! As the saying goes, "If I'd have <br/>
known you were coming I'd have baked a cake!"... which to a <br/>
letterboxer translates, "If I'd have known you were coming I would <br/>
have planted more boxes."<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to relax while I start working on more letterboxes, since <br/>
I now have my second wind! LOL! <br/>
<br/>
Oh, about my 'Pencil Me In' letterbox... I will visit it tomorrow <br/>
with bug spray, gloves, and a hooked stick to try to take it back <br/>
from the fire ants. Wish me luck! ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

locate, but 1st time I stopped a guy was selling eggs there.  I came <br/>
back later and another guy was sleeping in his car about 20 yards <br/>
away.  I quitely snuck over and searched, but could not find.  Hope <br/>
to have all my clues posted by end of weekend.  This will give you <br/>
something to go after also.  Thanks for hides!!!<br/>
