My Grandson Graceson  [the right way to spell it]  carved his first <br/>
stamp as his signature stamp this morning and off we went as Music Woman <br/>
reported, to "A Drive in the Park"  series on West Rock. He is on his <br/>
way to Brazil on a school project so we only have a short six day visit. <br/>
 We left a colorful page in the log books with Graceson new stamp adding <br/>
a nice touch to Bluebirds ,Music Woman's and my butterfly stamps.  There <br/>
was not much room left to write a message, but I think when you go find <br/>
the boxes, you will know that we did not have much time to write <br/>
either.!!  It is a well planned series, covering the great trails of <br/>
West Rock all the way down to the lake.  The stamps are beautiful  in <br/>
every way. You really must try this out.!!  I agree with Music Woman <br/>
that we think it is about 10 miles [ only kidding]   But some great <br/>
climbs and views.  <br/>
thanks Sadie and Russ.<br/>
