&gt; your "wilderness" adventure kind of thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had no problem finding the first box, but I'll be darned where <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; second box sneaked off to.  I finally gave up and called it quits.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fast forward to today:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I returned to find that second box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the street, I took 73 steps (or the best I could manage--it's <br/>
&gt; not exactly easy terrain to step through) like the clue said, and <br/>
at <br/>
&gt; around step 50 I darned near stepped on a snake.  Scared the s*** <br/>
out <br/>
&gt; of me!  I couldn't have been more than two feet away before it <br/>
&gt; decided to show its presence (those things blend in SOOO well) by <br/>
&gt; slithering in the opposite direction.  It was a harmless little <br/>
&gt; garter snake, but when things slither around you and you're not <br/>
&gt; expecting it, the reaction was pretty much the same as if a full-<br/>
&gt; grown grizzly bear suddenly jumped out from the trees above and <br/>
&gt; tackeled you (as unlikely as that might be).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After waiting for my heart rate to die down, I continued my hunt.  <br/>
&gt; While searching around a tree, I noticed this annoying black string <br/>
&gt; tangled around my feet.  Who the hell left this way out here?  Dum <br/>
&gt; asses.  I managed to get one foot untangled, but the other one <br/>
&gt; stubbernly stuck to my shoe.  Finally I realized why.  It was my <br/>
&gt; shoelace.  It seems one end of it got caught on something, and as I <br/>
&gt; walked it slowly unraveled the shoelace into a very long, very <br/>
&gt; useless piece of string.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I cut off the part that had been unraveled (gotta love those <br/>
handy <br/>
&gt; pocket knives).  Took off the rest of my shoelace to see what could <br/>
&gt; be done with it since I didn't carry around an extra pair in my <br/>
back <br/>
&gt; pocket, nor was I able to figure out how to use duct tape to help <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; situation.  (I thought duct tape was good for anything.)  I laced <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; shoe back up almost to the top, and it seemed to work pretty well.  <br/>
&gt; The shreaded part of my shoelaces I put in my pocket to carry back <br/>
&gt; out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now back to the hunt.  I still couldn't find that darned box, and I <br/>
&gt; KNEW it had to be around somewhere.  Maybe by that tree over <br/>
there?  <br/>
&gt; It didn't really seem like the tree described in the clue, but it <br/>
&gt; couldn't hurt to check--so I thought.  I poked a stick around in <br/>
some <br/>
&gt; leaves to see if the rock in the clue was hidden under them.  I <br/>
&gt; didn't find a letterbox nor a rock, but apparently I stirred up the <br/>
&gt; perverbal hornet's nest because I got stung by something that <br/>
HURT!  <br/>
&gt; Definitely not the typical mosquito bite!  The first sting I <br/>
thought <br/>
&gt; must have been a thorn I sat on or something--there were plenty in <br/>
&gt; the area--until I saw a whole SWAT team of those bugs attacking me, <br/>
&gt; at which point I quickly dropped the stick I was using and ran back <br/>
&gt; up to the street to regroup and send in reinforcements.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The two places where the bugs managed to sting me were still pretty <br/>
&gt; darn painful, and I had no idea what they were.  Still don't for <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; matter.  They weren't bees, and I've never noticed such bugs <br/>
before.  <br/>
&gt; I certainly haven't been attacked by them before.  So I headed back <br/>
&gt; down the hill--steering well clear of where the bugs and snake were <br/>
&gt; hiding out--to a remote place where I could pull down my pants to <br/>
&gt; examine the damage.  Didn't see anything, but darn it was painful <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; such little bugs.  I've donated blood with these very thick needles <br/>
&gt; over 70 times and it never hurt that badly!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At this point, I'm seriously contemplating to try looking for the <br/>
box <br/>
&gt; again another day.  Perhaps in the dead of winter when those damned <br/>
&gt; bugs would be frozen solid and snakes aren't slithering about.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I can't give up--not yet.  I go back down to hunt some more, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; continue to stear clear of the snake and bugs.  Like I said before, <br/>
&gt; that tree didn't really seem like the one mentioned in the clue, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; perhaps I can find a better one to investigate.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And, at long last, I found the box.  Hidden in the croch of two <br/>
&gt; deciduous trees, under a rock, just like the clue described.  I <br/>
&gt; logged in, replaced the box, and then headed back to the street <br/>
&gt; wondering if any of the cars driving by had any idea of the dangers <br/>
&gt; that lurked just a few short feet away.  =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This was the 78th box I found.  I've hidden 36.  They're located in <br/>
&gt; all shorts of areas from fairly public areas to very remote areas, <br/>
&gt; but I'll be darned if any of them were as much trouble as this one <br/>
&gt; smack dab in the middle of civilization a stone's throw from a <br/>
major <br/>
&gt; road!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Which might explain why only two other people have found this box <br/>
&gt; while many, many more than that found the first one.  Speaking of <br/>
&gt; which--the Drew clan, I believe, found this box last week and left <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; note saying they believe the first box was missing.  I went back to <br/>
&gt; verify if it really was or not, and it's still there.  I didn't <br/>
&gt; bother to open the first box having already found it and signed in, <br/>
&gt; but it appears to be in fine shape from the outside.  You just have <br/>
&gt; to root around the tree a bit more.  (That's assuming you had the <br/>
&gt; right tree in the first place--which I suspect you did considering <br/>
&gt; how easy it was to identify.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So that's my story of the day.  Miserable, stinking box, that it <br/>
&gt; was.  =)<br/>

You did better than I did.  The first box was easy if you dug deep<br/>
enough,but I haven't been able to find the second.  Any help you can<br/>

It's right where the clue says it's supposed to be.  I probably took <br/>
more than 73 steps to reach the right point (something the other two <br/>
people who logged in also mentioned), but it's located right where <br/>
it's supposed to be.  When you see the right tree, you think, "That's <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Delightful story, Ryan! Thanks so much for the entertainment! Now I <br/>
only WISH we Drewclan had been in Oregon, visiting my lovely sister <br/>
in Portland for instance, and searching out the many many intriguing <br/>
letterboxes there, but nooooooooo....we're here in fall's kingdom New <br/>
England. Someday we really mean to load up the wagon and head out, to <br/>
see what all this bruhaha about the Pacific Northwest is, to see <br/>
family and the homesteads of ancestors, and to look for a box or two.<br/>
<br/>
LOL!!<br/>

<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Which might explain why only two other people have found this box <br/>
&gt; while many, many more than that found the first one.  Speaking of <br/>
&gt; which--the Drew clan, I believe, found this box last week and left <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; note saying they believe the first box was missing.  I went back to <br/>
&gt; verify if it really was or not, and it's still there. <br/>
