During the Civil War, Sabine Pass became a major center for the <br/>
shipment of cotton in exchange for vital supplies for the Confederate <br/>
Army.  Fort Griffin was built on this location to protect Sabine Pass <br/>
from Union blockades.  In September of 1863, the troops in the <br/>
earthen fort were warned of 22 Union ships approaching.  Lt. Richard <br/>
Dowling commanded 46 fellow Texans in the fort, and on September 8th, <br/>
they were besieged by 4 Union gunboats.  With 6 cannons, his men <br/>
fought back, shattering and running aground 2 of the gunboats, and <br/>
winning a decisive victory.  President Jefferson Davis sent his <br/>
personal congratulations for the victory, and had special medals <br/>
struck for Dowling's men.  He called the battle the "Thermopylae of <br/>
the War", and "without parallel in ancient or modern war."  The fort <br/>
has been washed away, but a marker and statue now stands in its <br/>
probably location.  Also located in the park is four concrete <br/>
ammunition bunkers build during WWII.<br/>

SH 87.  Turn right and go through Sabine Pass, turning left 1.5 miles <br/>
south of town on Dowlen Road.  Follow the signs to the "Historical <br/>
