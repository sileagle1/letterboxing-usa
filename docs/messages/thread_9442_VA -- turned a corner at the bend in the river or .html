&gt; &gt; O.K. so Mom BeMa was really bummed after our miss at the<br/>
&gt;dog park and Dad<br/>
&gt; &gt; BeMa knew that when Mom is bummed....  So, off we went to try<br/>
&gt;for another<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterbox.  Need to end on a good note!  Headed back toward<br/>
&gt;home and decided<br/>
&gt; &gt; to try for one of the boxes we hadn't searched for at Riverbend.<br/>
&gt;We found<br/>
&gt; &gt; the dirt path and headed down along the river.  Pup made it to<br/>
&gt;the box in<br/>
&gt; &gt; about 8 minutes (draggin Mom behind), Dad (limping again)<br/>
&gt;trailing the<br/>
&gt; &gt; little ones, clocked in at closer to 20.  We love the little hiding<br/>
&gt;place<br/>
&gt; &gt; for this box (just where it's supposed to be and above ground!<br/>
&gt;-- no more<br/>
&gt; &gt; poking and digging around with the snakes and spiders --<br/>
&gt;although, now that<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think of it, something could have been in the hole too....)  This<br/>
&gt;box has<br/>
&gt; &gt; been well loved!  There are a ton of stamps and it has been the<br/>
&gt;home to (we<br/>
&gt; &gt; counted) 4 hitchhikers.  Unfortunately, none this time.  It's been<br/>
&gt;through<br/>
&gt; &gt; an animal gnawed stamp, a replacement stamp.  Well, if that's<br/>
&gt;not a lesson<br/>
&gt; &gt; in perseverance!  Mom BeMa is trying to take note and not<br/>
&gt;dwell on the ones<br/>
&gt; &gt; we couldn't find.  Going back along the path, pup slowed a little<br/>
&gt;and we<br/>
&gt; &gt; were able to admire the beautiful river.  Couldn't slow down too<br/>
&gt;much 'cause<br/>
&gt; &gt; the littlest BeMa must have been drinking water in the car...<br/>
&gt;Nice<br/>
&gt; &gt; restrooms and just in the nick of time!  All and all, a great<br/>
&gt;ending to a<br/>
&gt; &gt; nice day outdoors!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I can't believe we would have to ask for hints on a sixth failed to<br/>
&gt;locate<br/>
&gt; &gt; box.  It always seems we do it all right (all the time -- not just in<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxing.....).  But, here goes, is the last big tree really close to<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; start of the path to the left?  The big tree further down was part<br/>
&gt;of a ring<br/>
&gt; &gt; of trees and we thought if it was that one, it would be noted as<br/>
&gt;such.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Could the leaves have covered the little fallen tree?  Did the<br/>
&gt;letterboxers<br/>
&gt; &gt; we met hide it too well?  Should I stop obsessing and go back<br/>
&gt;to eating more<br/>
&gt; &gt; leftovers?  I think so!  There is always tomorrow and now that<br/>
&gt;great box in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Smithsonian (and I'm sure the info desk is close by)...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; BeMa<br/>
&gt; &gt; P3 F20 X (still none!  I don't think the boxers we met knew<br/>
&gt;about exchanges,<br/>
&gt; &gt; they said they were very new [then how come they found the<br/>
&gt;box we<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn't?]....) and 6 attempts (but we'll get them some day!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Which box exactly were you looking for at this time? A<br/>
&gt;Riverbend box, or the dog park? It's important?<br/>
