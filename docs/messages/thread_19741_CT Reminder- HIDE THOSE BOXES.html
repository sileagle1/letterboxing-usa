                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all!  I know this has been brought up before &amp; I will not <br/>
place the blame on any boxer(s) in particular, but today my daughter <br/>
&amp; I went to 3 different boxes- 1, our box Pine Point, 2 boxes at Ft. <br/>
Griswold (1 to restamp after our logbook got wet &amp; one of our images <br/>
was ruined &amp; to finally claim that elusive Drewclan Ft. Griswold <br/>
stamp).  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, all three boxes were completely uncovered &amp; viewable to the <br/>
untrained eye.  Having found (or not found) all three boxes before, <br/>
I know that they are typically VERY well covered so I IMPLORE you to <br/>
please cover the boxes better than you left them or at least make an <br/>
effort to conceal.  The Pine Point box is at a school with a lot of <br/>
traffic (children no less) &amp; there was no attempt made to cover it <br/>
at all although there were plenty of rocks nearby which generally <br/>
serve as a lovely cover.  Olive Oyl at Ft. Griswold was also <br/>
sticking out- but at least she is in an area that is a little less <br/>
likely to be happened upon by a passerby, but still, easily covered <br/>
before we left.  The elusive Drew box was very easy to find this go-<br/>
round as it was barely shoved into its hidey-hole (now it is <br/>
completely shoved in so the next person can stare at the spot <br/>
cluelessly as I did before- hee!).  <br/>

PLEASE REHIDE THESE TREASURES OR WE WILL LOSE THEM ALL!  Thank you!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I recently had a similar experience here in this Letterboxing Mecca.  Koko and I ventured out to Windsor in search of "Plant An Herb Garden", and although we had a great time at this too cool series, we were disappointed at the way ALL of the boxes were left!!  We could not believe that 4 or the 5 boxes were in OPEN baggies, inside baggies were open, and worst of all, the entire boxes were carelessly left (or tossed) in the "general vicinity" of where they should have been.  It's really sad to see boxes that someone has put time, effort and a little bit of their heart into laying by the wayside for ALL to see!  I've said it before, and believe... that if we ALL replace found boxes as if they were OUR OWN, we'd never see this scenario again.  Now, LET'S BOX!!!   MayEve<br/>
