Kensington Metropark today. They were placed as temporary boxes, and <br/>
I was concerned they'd be discovered and destroyed. I was pleased to <br/>
see how many 'boxers had signed into the logs. (thanks Springchick <br/>
for retrieving the remains of box #1 and placing them at the #2 <br/>
location) The stamps may reappear next spring! In the meantime, I am <br/>
working on a "Notable Dogs" box series, the first of which will be <br/>
Greyfriars Bobby (to be placed in the next week or so). The Bobby <br/>
stamp is not carved, but home made with  the rubber stamp making kit <br/>
from Artisan's choice.I will post clues when the box is placed. <br/>
