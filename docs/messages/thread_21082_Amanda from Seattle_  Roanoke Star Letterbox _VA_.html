&gt; Hi. This is the qmail-send program at yahoo.com.<br/>
&gt; I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following <br/>
addresses.<br/>
&gt; This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; :<br/>

&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just wanted to give you status on this box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Stamp and logbook were in great shape. What a perfect rock covering <br/>
the location! With the fresh fall leaves, it's virtually invisible.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The letterbox itself was in a gallon ziplock baggie that was pretty <br/>
torn up, so I replaced it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The view, even on a grey, overcast day was tremendous.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Really enjoyed it--you'll have to place more next time you are <br/>
around! Roanoke is kind of sad for letterboxers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; FamilyMan<br/>
