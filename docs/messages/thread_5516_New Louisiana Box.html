<div>Bogue Chitto National Wildlife Refuge<br/>Lock One 
Letterbox </div>
<div> </div>
<div><br/>The first task is to find Lock One Road.  This road meets Hwy 41, 
North of Pearl River, LA and Hwy 36 and South of Talisheek, LA and Hwy 
435.  The road is marked with an Army Corps of Engineers sign.  You 
will also see the Lock One Pantry Store and Joyce’s Restaurant at the 
junction.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Once the road is located, follow the black top to the parking area at the 
lock area.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Before you start your trek, walk to the tree line down river from the 
locks.  A bearing of 10 from the bluff will give you a general idea.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now cross the locks through the fenced in access.  The “No 
Trespassing” signs refer to the area on the other sides of the fences, crossing 
is OK.   Make your way down stream along the bank until you pass the 
boat launch on the far bank.  At this point keep your eyes open for 2 
cypress tress growing next to one another.  Be careful, you want two 
separate trees, not one split in two.  Stand between the trees and taking a 
bearing on the light pole next to the boat ramp.  220 will tell you the 
trees are the correct ones.  From this spot, 84 will point to a fallen tree 
hanging over the bluff.  The goal is at the base of the tree, beneath a 
rock and other cover on the southern side of the tree.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>WARNING!<br/>There could be dangerous crawling creatures close to the 
box.  Poking around with a stick would be a better choice than your 
hand.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Notes:<br/>Joyce’s is a good place to get a burger or a shake.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Happy Hunting!</div>
