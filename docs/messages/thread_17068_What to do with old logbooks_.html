<br/>
What do you do with old log books that get full in the boxes you have <br/>
placed? Obviously add a new book, but do you leave the first book in <br/>
the box or pull it and safeguard it?  <br/>
<br/>
Our Avery Tract Series is about 1/2 full and if this pace continues <br/>
we will have to replace them all (like 8 books) in the spring. <br/>
Recently our Gorton Cemetery log got full and we made a new log and <br/>
placed it in the box with the old one.  <br/>
<br/>
I've seen JD bring old books to gatherings so people can look through <br/>
them. I think leaving them in the box is risky, however I also know <br/>
that Heidi and I like looking through the early entries.  Hmmmmmm....<br/>

the box.<br/>

I would remove the (old) log entirely. I recently pulled the original log to Bird <br/>
Walk because I moved out of the area, the log was thin, and it was my first <br/>
attempt at a box and log...so it was removed and replaced with a hand-sewn <br/>
full log. <br/>
<br/>
I would keep the original (full) log and also like Music Woman said- there's just <br/>
not enough room in the box for an additional log. Additionally, if you though it <br/>
might walk off then I wouldn't risk the chance of leaving it in there.<br/>
<br/>
phyto<br/>
who now makes logs thinking about long term box construction - the logs are <br/>
now much thicker and all hand made...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I recently faced this issue with the cars-on-a-stick box.  Since this <br/>
is a box that's disappeared twice in less than a year, I knew I'd be <br/>
taking a big risk that neither I nor anyone else would ever see the <br/>
logbook again if I kept it in the box and just added a bunch of new <br/>
pages.  But that's what I did.  So much of the fun of finding a box <br/>
is looking through the logbook for old friends and new stamps.  Since <br/>
so much of my urban letterboxing work disappears anyway, I've <br/>
adopted, at least on my good days, a sort of zen-like attitude that <br/>
this is all transitory, and we should appreciate the moments that we <br/>
do have with letterboxes, and not assume that they will always be <br/>
there for us.  <br/>

took pictures of a log book that was damaged over the summer. Donna <br/>

out, I will leave the link on the clues page for a brief period of <br/>
