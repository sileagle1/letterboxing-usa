Meanwhile, I keep coming back to the idea of a letterbox that arrives in<br/>
your letterbox!  hehe!  That is ... a letterbox that finds you by mail.<br/>
It's a tricky idea, and Im not sure how to pull it off yet - but I'm<br/>
thinking (and open to hear your thoughts and suggestions) about sending a<br/>
log book and stamp to someone (CodyBCleo has volunteered on my short list of<br/>
folks so far).  Then you'd stamp in as you would with any other box, and<br/>
then mail it along to someone else.<br/>
<br/>
The trick is keeping the box moving, being willing to pay the postage for<br/>
the item to move along, and including addresses of willing letterboxers who<br/>
want the box.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts and suggestions?<br/>

What a great idea! Count me in! Here's how it might go: Make a simple webpage <br/>
where people wanting to participate could log their mailing address (maybe <br/>
give 2 weeks for people to add to the list.) Autumn then sends the Lb to one <br/>
lucky first participant. That person receives the package (can you imagine the <br/>
honor!) stamps in, notes the date and time of reception in the log, reseals the <br/>
package, perhaps adding a little piece of mail art to the outside, glues on <br/>
the same amount of postage as the original package (as it wouldn't increase, <br/>
thus no standing in  *&amp;$%! post office lines to mail) and sends it to another <br/>
person on the list, logging on to the webpage that it has been received and <br/>
passed along (it's a secret to whom). See how many people we can hit in a month's <br/>
time! It could move all over the country at speeds most hitchhikers only dream <br/>
of! <br/>
<br/>
The only draw-back might be people who don't want to give out their mailing <br/>
address but those who want to join in, I think it's a great idea. <br/>
Talk about letterboxing for those who can't get out for one reason or <br/>
another!<br/>

GREAT plan--except that you WILL have to stand in line--you can't put packages in a mailbox anymore, even with the correct postage.  (Altho my mail carrier knows me and is willing to take the package from me--I think!--perhaps you enjoy a similar situation.) Anyway, even if it does involve a trip to the PO, I'm game!<br/>

UPS and have them pick it up. The package can still be decorated as <br/>
you, or the people involved, see fit. I find the postal lbox very <br/>
interesting.<br/>

Y'all could make this postage friendly.  Our post office has a self <br/>
service station where you can weigh your package and get postage <br/>
right there at the scale.  If it is under 1 pound, you can just put <br/>
the package in the slot.  If it's over 1 pound, you have to take it to <br/>
the window.  It's unlikely that it would be over 1 pound.  Also, you <br/>
wouldn't need to put the log and stamp in tupperware, although that is <br/>
the traditional letterbox.  There must be something sleek and thin you <br/>
could use.  Or just send the log and stamp in a fancy envelope.  A <br/>
spiral-bound log may not survive if it's just stuck in an envelope so <br/>
you may have to look around for a flat log.  Or you could beg Sarah of <br/>
the Apple Dumpling Gang to make a log for you. She decoupages them!  <br/>
They are beautiful and one of the best things is that you can take <br/>
them apart to add pages. <br/>
