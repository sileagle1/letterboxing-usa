all learn at some point in our history that Deborah means "The Bee"?  I'd <br/>
heard there were more than one Debbie's using a bee, so I thought adding my <br/>
last initial might help distinguish us - maybe I'll use my middle name - <br/>
and be (bee?) Debbie Lee (the bee) - or like my email address, dlt (debbie, <br/>

Maybe it's just a sign of great minds thinking alike. ;-)  I've actually been considering changing mine when I reached 100, then I became really attached to my cute little bee, so who knows.  Maybe I could "bee crazy" or "bee free" (or is that born free?).  It's friday the brain has stopped functioning and I probably should do some work today.  Happy November!!!!<br/>
