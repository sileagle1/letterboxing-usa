   I was watching the Today Show this morning and Al Roker was <br/>
interviewing David Blaine. For those of you who haven't any idea who <br/>
Blaine is, he is a magician. He was the guy "frozen" in ice for a <br/>
couple of days and stood on a pole in Central Park for a couple of <br/>
days. That kind of magician.<br/>
   Blaine was hawking his new book "Mysterious Stranger" and a new <br/>
magic trick that he plans on doing next spring. Blaine says hidden in <br/>
the book are clues to $100,000 buried in the continental U.S. He says <br/>
he personally buried the money. I'm not on his payroll and suggesting <br/>
you buy the book. To believe me check it out at a bookstore.<br/>
   The point I'm trying to make is; all you guys who like to solve <br/>
the difficult ones, here's an opportunity to solve a hidden treasure <br/>
and get something for it.<br/>
   Hey Ryan, if you solve it you can letterbox a few more years <br/>
before getting that job!!!!!!!!<br/>

  ps: if a letterboxer does find it I'd like a bird dog fee of $25 :-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I saw that on a treasure hunting site and went out and bought the <br/>
book the other day.  It's going to take a better puzzle solver than I <br/>
to figure that one out. : O   Just as an FYI for anyone that goes to <br/>
try it - the code sends you to collect a map, which will lead you to <br/>
an amulet and it's that amulet that will prove you're the winner of <br/>
the money.  So there is travel involved!  <br/>
