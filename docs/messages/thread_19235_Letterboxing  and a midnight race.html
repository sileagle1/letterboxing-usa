                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was trying to think of something that included letterboxing that would be<br/>
a one night excursion for anyone that might want a little more excitement to<br/>
a hunt.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to put a news release in my local newspaper about a Letterbox<br/>
hunt with a special twist (they recently did an article).  This one will<br/>
start after midnight on a certain day (I would not post the clues on the<br/>
Letterboxing.com website until midnight) the first one to locate the box<br/>
will receive $50.00 which will be stashed in the box.<br/>
<br/>
First I think it would be great to look for clues in the dark!  I would make<br/>
sure it is safe and lawful but still exciting.<br/>
<br/>
Curious to know what others think?  I am open to suggestions, I have other<br/>
ideas but I thought I would start with this one.  I am also coming from<br/>
trying to find something my teenage son and friends would get excited about<br/>
and I would send a adult to oversee their hunt.<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like fun to me.  =)  Liability concerns, perhaps, but if it's <br/>
all legal and legit, why not?  I love hiking in the dark sometimes.  <br/>
(Preferably when the moon is full and I can get around without using <br/>
a flashlight--really experience the night that way!)<br/>
<br/>

&gt; excited about<br/>
<br/>
I have good news about your teenage son and friends!  I study has <br/>
recently been released showing that there IS a cure for such a <br/>
condition.  It's called Time.  The bad news, however, is that it <br/>
seems the demand for Time was way under-estimated, so Time is in very <br/>
short supply.  There are devices reportedly out there that allows you <br/>
to 'save Time', but how can you save something you don't have in the <br/>
first place?  But fear not, the teenage condition is, allegedly, <br/>
temporary in nature, regardless of whether or not you manage to <br/>
acquire any Time.<br/>

<br/>
I thought I would hide the letter box somewhere in the city no need to worry<br/>
about creepy crawlies.  It might even be hid some where you need to be<br/>
discrete or you might be noticed.  The part about the darkness is the late<br/>
night hour and in some places you would need to travel where it maybe become<br/>
dark with only spaced out street lights to guide your travels but I would<br/>
want it to be a safe hunt but not to be done alone given the fact you never<br/>
know who you might meet out at that late night hour.<br/>

&gt; a one night excursion for anyone that might want a little more excitement to<br/>
&gt; a hunt.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The idea is to put a news release in my local newspaper about a Letterbox<br/>
&gt; hunt with a special twist (they recently did an article).  This one will<br/>
&gt; start after midnight on a certain day (I would not post the clues on the<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing.com website until midnight) the first one to locate the box<br/>
&gt; will receive $50.00 which will be stashed in the box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First I think it would be great to look for clues in the dark!  I would make<br/>
&gt; sure it is safe and lawful but still exciting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Curious to know what others think?  I am open to suggestions, I have other<br/>
&gt; ideas but I thought I would start with this one.  I am also coming from<br/>
&gt; trying to find something my teenage son and friends would get excited about<br/>
&gt; and I would send a adult to oversee their hunt.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any thoughts??<br/>

Good question!! I think there are about a dozen letterboxers within ear shot <br/>

Yes, that box was difficult! With a million rocks to look under we had a <br/>
tough time. We almost gave up until we figured out the French Bread was the rock. <br/>
Still, Jiggs knew that, even after I helped him with the clues after his first <br/>
try but he still didn't get it. He was looking for the 2nd time last weekend. <br/>
<br/>
You might want to reconsider where it is placed as it was first in a drainage <br/>
area that would get it flooded all the time. Also, those heavy rocks tend to <br/>
mutilate those 'throw-away' boxes. It needs to be on higher ground within that <br/>
rock area.<br/>

I think I have had around 9 visitors so far with only one saying they almost<br/>
gave up.  The rock part is the hardest but if you think about the clues even<br/>
then I said between a big one and French bread that should have helped.<br/>

even with the rain last season it stayed dry.<br/>

&gt; Yes, that box was difficult! With a million rocks to look under we had a<br/>
&gt; tough time. We almost gave up until we figured out the French Bread was the<br/>
&gt; rock. <br/>
&gt; Still, Jiggs knew that, even after I helped him with the clues after his first<br/>

&gt; You might want to reconsider where it is placed as it was first in a drainage<br/>
&gt; area that would get it flooded all the time. Also, those heavy rocks tend to<br/>
&gt; mutilate those 'throw-away' boxes. It needs to be on higher ground within that<br/>
&gt; rock area.<br/>

Yes I had removed the box for about a week.  I did not intend to keep over a<br/>
day but I got distracted and forgot to put it back.  I think it was Sunday<br/>
evening when I replaced it.  I hope you make it back to try again.<br/>
