All the boxers who signed up for the "Little Acorns of Happiness"<br/>
postal Lb.  since yesterday, 11/20/03, should have received a<br/>
confirming email.  If for some reason you haven't, please contact me.<br/>

was deleting a bunch of spam last night.  I hope it wasn't from a boxer.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
