<p>The Mystery Gathering is now just a few weeks away! </p>
<p>I happened to come upon the original post and invitation from Tom Noone and noticed that contained therein was another invitation to bring carvings to share. </p>
<p>Many of us are interested in seeing what others are creating. I think it would be fun to share our carvings whether they are completed stamps or works in progress. Just a thought.</p>

                    <html><body>Thank you to Tom for putting together a wonderful mystery gathering.  I too was surprised that so many people came out on a rainy day to get exchanges and boxes!   It proved to be a very fruitful day:
<br/>36 exchanges (some of those at the party I already had)
<br/>Also was able to receive the Canonicus, Matrioshka, Letterboxing Northwest Stamp, Bosun's box, Flutterby, Letterbox Fairy, KMartha &amp; Boo!  We declined to find the other stamps since they were (hopefully) staying at Ninigret.
<br/>
<br/>We left the party kind of early in hopes of find the Dancing Men, and I'm happy to report that we FINALLY got our diploma after weeks of looking in the wrong spot!  We would have gone for Pine Barrens as well, but nighttime overtook us and we had to head for home.
<br/>
<br/>On Sunday, after looking for a place to sit and have breakfast (Darrin FINALLY settled on a place in Mystic after I said ENOUGH DRIVING! I'm hungry!), we found the Avalonia Gate box which was a bonus box for another box in the area.  We also tried to find Wanda and Pete's "Going Downhill" mystery letterbox.  We were at the right place, but ran out of daylight, and were even up on top of the ski mountain in the dark, soaked with rain at about 6:30 looking for it!  We ended up deciding that we should come back another day when the batteries in the flash light started to go dim.  We finally got back down the hill after I slid down parts of the mountain twice in the mud!  I was totally dirty!  It was nice to finally get back to the house in CHarlestown and take a nice hot shower in the inside shower!  Darrin for some reason decided to take one in the outside shower, doesn't that defeat the purpose of taking a shower to get warm?????
<br/>
<br/>On Monday, we went back to Ninigret and found the Frosty Drew Observatory box, and tried to find the DiscGolf box, since we didn't stay long enough on Sat. to get the "official" word on if it was missing.  Alas, it is indeed missing :-(  So we ventured back home to CT by way of Southern CT (I live in Manchester, don't ask!!) to find the Summer Music box that we missed a couple of weeks ago, and get the Third Rock from the Sun box before it retired on Tuesday.
<br/>
<br/>Thank you again to everyone who made the mystery gathering really fun!  We hope to see you all soon!  If you are going to the Rocky Neck gathering this weekend, we may or may not be there, depending on whether I get my graduate school work done for Monday!

boxers expressed interest in the letterboxing t-shirt I was wearing. <br/>
While it is certainly not my intention to "market" anything to the <br/>
group, I did want to let interested parties know that I plan to <br/>
attend the mystery gathering and will bring some extras if there is <br/>
interest. Just email me off site with any questions or specific <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd like to add my thanks to everyone who joined us in Wickford, RI <br/>
yesterday for the Mystery Gathering. There was good cheer all 'round <br/>
and the bounty was, as always, varied and delicious. It was nice <br/>
meeting so many of you for the first time and seeing boxers I've met <br/>
before once again. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you who participated in learning how to make hand-<br/>
bound books. Even though it was a somewhat abbreviated version, I <br/>
hope you all got bitten by the bug to make your own logbooks, <br/>
journals or what have you. If anyone has any questions about what we <br/>
did, please feel free to contact me anytime and I'll try to help. The <br/>
kids who participated did very well! Thanks too to Turtle McQ and <br/>
Judi of the Psychokiwi's for bringing samples of books they have <br/>
made. What an inspiration! <br/>
<br/>
Since my "thing" is carving, several of the attendees shared some of <br/>
their work with me that blew me away. We have some real talent here <br/>
in Southern New England. SNE Letterboxers, go out and find TGD's in <br/>
MA and RTRW's/Cherieph's boxes, mostly in CT, I believe. You'll be <br/>
rewarded with incomparable art hidden inside that Rubbermaid! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Trish for arranging such a great place for the gathering. We <br/>
talked about about a cold-weather gather here. Stay tuned. And your <br/>
daughter really carved that cool stamp in the car while waiting for <br/>
me to get un-lost???? AMAZING! <br/>
<br/>
WarriorWoman, we're glad you made it and it seems you've made a young <br/>
convert to letterboxing! It'll be hard to keep her off the trails! <br/>
<br/>
Chuck and Chickabirdie, glad to see that both of you and Molly joined <br/>
us, though I felt badly she was unable to participate in learning how <br/>
to make books due to her having two more paws than the Community <br/>
Center regulations allowed inside. Apparently, the powers-that-be <br/>
have never heard of the famous "Molly!" <br/>
<br/>
Lastly and sadly, we bid farewell to our good friends,the <br/>
Psychokiwi's. Best of luck on your journey back to New Zealand and we <br/>
hope to hear from you about letterboxing adventures there. Remember <br/>
SIX letterboxes there is not an acceptable number. You know what your <br/>
mission is! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks to all.<br/>
<br/>

Thank you so very much Alafair ! A plug from you like this is going <br/>
to have me smiling ( and happily carving ) for days .<br/>
Ryan greatly enjoyed your class and he had a wonderful time filling <br/>
his new logbook with exchanges from all the fine letterboxers<br/>
who attended . We also went out after and he picked up the Faces of <br/>
Wickford . He also managed to stamp the Dancing Men image into it <br/>
yesterday ! YAY !!<br/>
I want to thank Tom for putting this together , and Yes there is <br/>
interest in a gathering for mid March .<br/>
Judy and Linton ( PsychoKiwi's ) we where glad to get to see you <br/>
again , and you will be missed .<br/>
Thanks to all who attended , we really had a great time . We hope we <br/>
will see some of you again on the Cape in a couple weeks .<br/>

Every find, every event, is a cherished victory for me (you know <br/>
why).  And yes, Nutty Buddy has caught the "bug".  Pretty Kitty's <br/>
other friend, "Too Tweet" was very sad that she could not come. <br/>
<br/>
It looks like I'll be revisiting previously found boxes to get her <br/>
caught up.  Don't be surprised if you see my numbers read something <br/>
like this "P15, HH40, F66(x2)"<br/>
<br/>

Wow, I went to the Molly/Ginger gathering last weekend, and the <br/>
Mystery Gathering this weekend and, talk about overwhelming! <br/>
Everyone is SO nice.. and Alafair's bookbinding class was way cool.<br/>
Get this... for JUST these two events I stamped into 20 HH, amassed <br/>
12 new finds +2 event stamps and gained 73 exchanges/friends. Not to <br/>
metion the boxing on the way to and from each event has brought me to <br/>
98 boxes. I'm SO excited about hitting 100 that I'm running out right <br/>
now to find 2! I realizing I'm "tooting" a horn here, but who else <br/>
can I share with? Anyways, While I truly felt awkward attending a <br/>
gathering of people I'd never met (who wouldn't?) I encourage anyone <br/>
who has thought about it.. but not had the courage to go... GO! <br/>
There is so much more to gain and NOTHING to lose. Call someone and <br/>
partner up.. whatever you have to do. Have fun.. and "just do it" to <br/>
quote a famous slogan:) And thank-you to everyone who made me feel <br/>
welcome. You are all very special people! <br/>
Happy Boxing, and see you on the trail! Kim "Kstar"<br/>
