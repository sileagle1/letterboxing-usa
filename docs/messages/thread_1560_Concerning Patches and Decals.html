                    <div class="plaintext-content">HI,   The order was made a couple weeks ago.   We can expect the patches in <br/>
about 3 to 4 weeks.  The embroidery shop did call me and let me know that <br/>
they have received several individual orders since then directly to them.  It <br/>
is causing them a little bit of concern.   <br/>
<br/>
 So just to set the record straight.............. the order form listed on <br/>
LbNA is intended for BULK ORDERS ONLY.  :o)  In order to make any more orders <br/>
from Town Hall  Embroidery you need to order atleast 50 of the same patches  <br/>
or atleast  25 Decals.  If you can't make that large of an order then wait a <br/>
while, maybe next spring, and we might have enough interest again to make <br/>
another group bulk order.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
I looked into the cost for individual order patches ... they were very pricey <br/>
$10 each with a one time $80 set up charge and would be of lower quality.  So <br/>
I plan to check out another shop near here.  If I get a good price I will let <br/>
you all know.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
OR  someone could volunteer to buy 50 of each merit patch denomination and <br/>
then charge a little extra to dole them out as people earn them .... but that <br/>
might get pretty expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone for your patience, Happy Hunting,<br/>
