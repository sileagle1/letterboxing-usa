the rock wasn't large enough to show above the snow.<br/>
<br/>
We had a little trouble with the other "Trees of the Forest" box. We <br/>
only found a Forest Thinning sign after much wandering, and not near <br/>
an intersection. We also did not find south-pointing birches, or the <br/>
double-trunked birch. I'm pretty sure we started from the correct <br/>
gate. :/<br/>
<br/>
We also did the Fishers of Men, after fantastic burgers at the Landing <br/>
Zone Grille. Bruce got a little zealous getting the box out of the <br/>
snow and broke it. But, we promise to replace it with a brand-new box <br/>
tomorrow. Sorry <blush><br/>
<br/>
We didn't get a chance at Sessions Woods, so that's on tomorrow's <br/>
agenda as well.<br/>
