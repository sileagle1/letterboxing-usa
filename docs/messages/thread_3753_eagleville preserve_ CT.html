                    <div class="plaintext-content">We enjoyed the hike in Eagleville Preserve yesterday, but wanted to let<br/>
its owner (Leader of the Pack, I think) know that it's soggy through and<br/>
through.  The container was rusty and the lid was loose, so the log book<br/>
was almost too wet to write in.  The baggies were even wet inside.  <br/>
<br/>
I have access to an infinite number of plastic containers that I'd be<br/>
glad to donate to Cockadoodlemoo 4H if you would be interested in them. <br/>
They're the take-out meal containers from a gourmet restaurant in<br/>
Glastonbury where my husband works, so we have a good collection of them<br/>
from leftover foods he has brought home.  We haven't used them as<br/>
letterbox containers yet, but I think they'll work well.  Just say the<br/>
word and I'll be happy to drop some off wherever would be convenient.<br/>
<br/>
