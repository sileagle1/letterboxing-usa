<blockquote type="CITE">We should speak out against malicious, hateful<br/>
statements, even when it is against one of our members that we disagree<br/>
with. I have never met any of the parties involved in this but this is my<br/>
community also. It is our community.  Lets stop the hate. Lets speak out<br/>
whenever things start getting out of hand, whenever someone seems to be<br/>
outnumbered and is accosted with hateful sentiments, but do so in a way that<br/>
we are not turning hate onto the opposite side. Carefully choose our words<br/>
so we don't hurt others.This probably isn't coming out the way I want it to.<br/>
Like I said, I'm not the greatest at writing or presenting my thoughts. If I<br/>
did not come across the way I wanted to, well, we all can have a good laugh.<br/>
If I did, lets stop this fighting every other week. Lets just live and let<br/>
live. "To see the right and not to do it is cowardice." - Confucius. I just<br/>
know that I am going to be ridiculed for this email ,but you know what, it<br/>
doesn't really matter. I did and said what I think is right with no malice<br/>
to anyone. For that I am proud, despite anything that can be said about me<br/>
or my opinion.....Chuck and Molly<br/>
