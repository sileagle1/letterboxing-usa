                        Hi friends,

After reading all the posts on dye vs. pigment ink, and stories of wet,

                        I'm heading to Tulsa shortly today and I'm wondering
if there is anything special to be known about boxes
in that area.  All in place, except those noted on
their clues?  Any that are "can't miss"? ...

                        And, in some cases, yes I do know what brand ink some boxers are 
using... Phyto and Solor & Binx use Marvy Markers often. Camera Obscura
