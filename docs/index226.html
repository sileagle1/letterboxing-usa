                        I found some of the posts they were talking about.  They were last 
October.  Look at the post around #34503.  If we work this out I'll 
post and let you know what and how we did.

                        Could anyone provide a list of easy Las Vegas boxes?
I won't have a vehicle but a short taxi ride would
be no issue.  We'll be staying on the strip.

Thanks

                        I think you'd be better off with a treasure hunt in your own yard - similar to an Easter Egg hunt- No clues- just look for little hidden prizes.  Then let the kids keep what they find.  Save the...
