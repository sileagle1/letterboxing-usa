                        Hi.

Just started Letterboxing with my 6 year-old yesterday.  Found our first box 
in Norristown, PA.  This all looks maddening... and fun.

Thanks to Riversol for Space Shuttle Explorer and thanks...

I'll be there for four days, Friday through Monday as part of the 
celebration. ...

or
B) You could set up a webpage for the hobby.
