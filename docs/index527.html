                        I just added a box that we placed on Easter Sunday and I forgot to 
check the box to add it to What's New.  Is there anyway I can do

Thanks,

                        I have transferred over all the boxes unclaimed to this point.  If I 
missed one of your and you need help entering it into the new system 
please let me know.
