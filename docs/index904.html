                        I just found out about letterboxing through Walking.about.com

I'm in Charleston, WV and wonder if there is anyone close by?  I'd be 
interested in starting or joining a local group.

                        Hi Webmasters,

Just checking the hitchhiker page and noticed the "Camping in Connecticut" 
driver is incorrect.

It should be ESAK not EGAD

Just thought you should know

Thanks.
