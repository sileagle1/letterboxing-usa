                        Dear Todd,

Congratulations on another letterbox. I like your clues very much. 
The mystery location type of letterbox has a great appeal. Hope it 
turns out not to be too far from Vermont - I'd love...

                        Jay Drew and his family have salted yet another letterbox in 
southern New England, this one at Newport, RI.

I think it has an exceptionally nice flavor to it - definitely 
salty!

                        What a beautiful postcard, Marty! Wish I could help with the

time period.
