A fellow Letterboxer informed me that my Letterbox was 
missing, so on Oct. 11, 2001, I rehid a new box. See new clues for Farmington 
Valley Greenway North Letterbox.
Thanks Alen.

                        Happy to see that Jay got his computer problems solved and What's New 
on the LbNA website is up to date.  You never know how much you miss 
something until it's gone.  Great job.
