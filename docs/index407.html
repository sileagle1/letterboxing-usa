                        Two new boxes were planted in Chaplin, CT today. If you saw these clues pop up earlier today you may want to check out a few corrections I made this evening.

                        My husband and I took our chance on an unclaimed box in Elora, Ontario.

                        Just a note to say we checked on Conestoga today and it is doing fine
