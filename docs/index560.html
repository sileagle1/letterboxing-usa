                        I know there are no rules, but I am curious...  when somebody sends

                        Hello HoneyBees.  My daughter and I checked up on one of our lettercaches and 
loved seeing your HoneyBees stickers.  Did you visit anyother boxes in our 
area?

Happy Hunting,  Mohmers

                        Just wondering if anyone has visited the V-Bar box in Mississippi yet.
 Also wondering if anyone has run across The Uncas H.H.

Thanks
