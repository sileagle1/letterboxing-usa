    One attendee is kindly bringing some apple cider to share, but as for 
other beverages, we're asking all attendees to bring their own (btw state 
parks don't allow alcohol).

                        By the way, when are people planning to arrive on Saturday? I want to meet as 
many of you as I can, but I'm going to have to leave early to make it to a 
surpise 50th birthday party.
