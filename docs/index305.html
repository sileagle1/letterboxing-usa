                        Hi all. The End Gang is heading to Fredricksburg Va. for a few days 
of R and R. Saw a nice little trove of boxes there. Any suggestions

                        I think we need to clarify our terminology. There are several

                        I live in Vegas- and was wondering about placing boxes in Red Rock Canyon.  This is under the BLM administration.  Does that count as  a national park?

Thanks, Zoe-Anne

                        As I recall the Nat. Park rule language is more like "no letterboxes 
or geocaches may be placed 'without permission.'"  Correct me if I 
am wrong.
