                        We went searching for our first box this weekend and found only one 
of the two at Huntley Meadows in Alexandria, VA.  Anyone know if the 
first box has gone missing?

Thanks!

We'll gladly replace the missing Redwing and Gnome boxes...give me a few days 
to carve stamps and I'll let our fab webmaster know.  I don't know what the 
Gnome stamp looked like so I can wing it,...
