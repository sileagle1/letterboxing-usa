missing. We would like it if anyone who found and stamped into this box send

                        This is the website I found for clues.  Whether they have Wales and Scotland clues, I'm not sure.

                        Hi boxers:

Please be advised that I have had a change of heart. This box will no 
longer be a HH. I will be pulling it at lunch and will post clues 
when I find a permanent home for it...

                        3 new boxes have been planted at Highland Forest near Fabius, NY.
"Cat o' Mine", "Gregory Peck", and "Little Flower".
Easy boxes on a kid friendly trail.

cheers,
