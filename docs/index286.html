                        As it turns out, Old Blue woke up with 'the cruds' this morning and I don't 
think letterboxing in Kernville will be in our weekend plans after all. So

                        I'm so relieved to hear that pesky beaver made it safely to the west

                        Just FYI Aaron's Birthday Box has been pulled due to rain. After a brief
