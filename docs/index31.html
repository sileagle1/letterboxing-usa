                        I like the pencil rub technique as well but I do treat the rubber 
surface with acetone prior to rubbing. This seems to help the pencil 
transfer somewhat and I can kill off a few more brain cells...

                        Now I only know of 2 sites to list letterboxes in North America, and I
