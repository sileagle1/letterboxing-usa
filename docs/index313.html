                        Has anyone found this box lately.  WE searched two weeks ago and it 
seemed to be missing.

                        Hi Boxers

For those with a fascination for marine science there are two new
boxes in the Blue Hill area to enjoy with some trivia in the clues.

Happy Boxing,

                        Hi all!

Mrs Jiggs surprised me with a special LB planted especially for 
Valentines Day!

It's an easy little box to find, with very little, even-surface 
walking. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did...
