                        Greetings,

The F-100 Postal Gathering for MA has to be postponed.

                        I've been letterboxing in the dark, though it was entirely

                        Congratulations to Lenny and Kathy, The NeeDeeps, on hitting the 1000 find
mark. A tremendous achievement. I wonder how many miles and miles of hiking
that took? Very glad to see you hit that mark....
