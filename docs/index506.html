                        Just a question.  Didn't there used to be a link from the main LBNA
site to the hitchiker (traveler) site?  Or is this letterboxing hobby
really driving me crazy?

                        Is that anywhere near Beckley? I have family in the Beckley/Oak Hill area and visit from time to time. If Ritchie's close, it would make a good side trip.
