                        Hi
We emailed you some clues to a new letterbox we put in 
Arches national park outside Moab, Utah. Did you get the 
clues? I haven't seen it posted yet.

Thanks
Jennifer Curd

                        Sorry to report especially to those that found #1 that I checked on 
Hojack #2 this Saturday and could not find it.  I did a little 
scouting, but didn't see the box or bits of it.

What a pleasant and adventurous hike.  We
