                        I have just gotten interested in letterboxing as a result of the PBS 
program.  There does not seem to be much activity in this area and I 
just wonder if there are others in the FL Panhandle?

                        I found the "June Gloom" H.H. at "Oriental Medicine" and the "Yaketty 
Yak" H.H. at the "Nehantic State Forest" letterbox. All in all, 19 
finds- not bad. Happy letterboxing!!   --Northstar
