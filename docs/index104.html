                        Brought it home to dry out (thanks for the tip-off, Shell!).  Will post

                        I'm a first-time letterboxer and was hoping someone could recommend a 
few good excursions in the Greater Boston area?  We have a car and 
could travel, but hopefully not too far.

Any suggestions...
