to see other people on the list that I know :-) Glad I could be of
assistance. Give Tris a hug for me

Check out the site I created last night and let me 
know what you think. The 'Stamps' page has the stamps I've carved and have 
placed or plan to place. If you don't mind seeing the stamps...

Very nice website. 
 I like your carvings and think you did a good job at them. You do need to 
get a better picture of yourself so we can see you and you are not in the
