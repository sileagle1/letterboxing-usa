                        I will be in the Cleveland area next week and hope to create a little

downtown, I'll have a car.
Any suggestions?

You'll find 2 new boxes in northern California and they're not too far apart. 
One placed by yours's truly and another that...

                        The Black Jack Acorn HH was sent on it's way recently somewhere in 
Northern NY State, hidden behind an erratic. Happy hunting.

                        I've retired the Liberty State Park box.  As the statue is closed, and part of my clue was chopped down, I figured it was getting difficult.  I will put a drive by box there, with a different image,...
