It was 
fun to see the Ohio gathering pics. Did anyone ever send out any of the pics 
from the East Coast/Virginia gathering?

                        Well, today was depressing. I went out and checked on my two babies today. 
While the little peoples box is safe and slowly filling up, it seems that 
Alice lasted little more then a month.

                        Truth to tell Ryan, I do not remember if you had visited this box.  I 
looked specificly to see if Amanda had.

Sorry it remains a possible hit for you.

                        I thought I had already sent this out to the masses.  But I guess not, cuz I 
can't find it anywhere, even in the archives.  I'd planted it for the 
gathering back in August!
