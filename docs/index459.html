                        I would think that if a person copy-pasted clues under their own name, 
that it wouldn't matter then when the webmasters deleted the

Please take the time to go to the site and search for boxes by placer.
In there is the choice of AbandonedBoxes. There are plenty! If you

I don't know what the protocol for listing a missing box is...I've 
tried to find some info on the site and group, but to no avail. 
Please forgive me if this is not the way to mention it and...

                        Since, as Randy states, the issue is that the webmasters do not want
the responsibility or liability for orphan boxes, the problem is
already solved by listing them as abandoned. The webmasters are...
