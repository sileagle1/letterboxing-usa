Where are you?  I know you are out there.  

Does anyone know where the usual suspects of traveling event stamps 
are?  I am specifically hoping to locate the LbNA map and K-Mart ha.

If anyone...

Highway finder!
I just used last week the trip plan feature using the Interstates.  
It was so much fun to see what I could find along the 780 mile trip
