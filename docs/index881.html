                        thanks for your "toe path" box in Griggstown. it is in good shape and it
helped keep me in good shape after eating a big lunch at O'Connors
restaurant. Will you be planting any more?

box with new clues. My old clues are posted on the site. Could you please 
replace it with these new clues.
Thank you, Bill
