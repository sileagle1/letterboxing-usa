                        I really, truly am not fond of practical jokes and, therefore, April 1st is 
NOT my favorite day. HOWEVER, after logging on to the website and experiencing

                        You definately got me! I was ready to post a message that we should go 
pick up the picket signs and protest to have letterboxing.org back.

It is so rare that Alan (Letterboxer2002), Peter (Pearl), and

                        I will let it loose as a hitchhiker though it may take a week or two 
since I am on vacation next week.

I think Bye Bye Birdie is a perfect theme for a hitchhiker.

                        So I guess any boxes placed today will always be suspect?
I hope nobody is mean enough to make us hike many miles
for a box, only to get an "April Fools" message.
