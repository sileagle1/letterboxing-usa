                        I just got 2 letterboxes to plant! In the mail! From Irish Bain!

eeee, I am excited! Now I get to find a spot and write some clues and
hide, but I don't have to try and carve myself!

                        Is it uncouth to turn a postal ring stamp into a traditional letterbox?

Thanks.
